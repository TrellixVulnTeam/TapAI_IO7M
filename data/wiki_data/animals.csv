Rats are various medium-sized, long-tailed rodents|rat
Species of rats are found throughout the order Rodentia, but stereotypical rats are found in the genus Rattus|rat
Other rat genera include Neotoma (pack rats), Bandicota (bandicoot rats) and Dipodomys (kangaroo rats).|rat
Rats are typically distinguished from mice by their size|rat
"Usually the common name of a large muroid rodent will include the word ""rat"", while a smaller muroid's name will include ""mouse"""|rat
The common terms rat and mouse are not taxonomically specific|rat
There are 56 known species of rats in the world.|rat
The best-known rat species are the black rat (Rattus rattus) and the brown rat (Rattus norvegicus)|rat
This group, generally known as the Old World rats or true rats, originated in Asia|rat
Rats are bigger than most Old World mice, which are their relatives, but seldom weigh over 500 grams (17+1⁄2 oz) in the wild.The term rat is also used in the names of other small mammals that are not true rats|rat
Examples include the North American pack rats (aka wood rats) and a number of species loosely called kangaroo rats|rat
Rats such as the bandicoot rat (Bandicota bengalensis) are murine rodents related to true rats but are not members of the genus Rattus.|rat
Male rats are called bucks; unmated females, does, pregnant or parent females, dams; and infants, kittens or pups|rat
A group of rats is referred to as a mischief.The common species are opportunistic survivors and often live with and near humans; therefore, they are known as commensals|rat
They may cause substantial food losses, especially in developing countries|rat
However, the widely distributed and problematic commensal species of rats are a minority in this diverse genus|rat
Many species of rats are island endemics, some of which have become endangered due to habitat loss or competition with the brown, black, or Polynesian rat.Wild rodents, including rats, can carry many different zoonotic pathogens, such as Leptospira, Toxoplasma gondii, and Campylobacter|rat
The Black Death is traditionally believed to have been caused by the microorganism Yersinia pestis, carried by the tropical rat flea (Xenopsylla cheopis), which preyed on black rats living in European cities during the epidemic outbreaks of the Middle Ages; these rats were used as transport hosts|rat
Another zoonotic disease linked to the rat is foot-and-mouth disease.Rats become sexually mature at age 6 weeks, but reach social maturity at about 5 to 6 months of age|rat
The average lifespan of rats varies by species, but many only live about a year due to predation.The black and brown rats diverged from other Old World rats in the forests of Asia during the beginning of the Pleistocene.|rat
The characteristic long tail of most rodents is a feature that has been extensively studied in various rat species models, which suggest three primary functions of this structure|rat
thermoregulation, minor proprioception, and a nocifensive-mediated degloving response|rat
Rodent tails—particularly in rat models—have been implicated with a thermoregulation function that follows from its anatomical construction|rat
This particular tail morphology is evident across the family Muridae, in contrast to the bushier tails of Sciuridae, the squirrel family|rat
The tail is hairless and thin skinned but highly vascularized, thus allowing for efficient countercurrent heat exchange with the environment|rat
The high muscular and connective tissue densities of the tail, along with ample muscle attachment sites along its plentiful caudal vertebrae, facilitate specific proprioceptive senses to help orient the rodent in a three-dimensional environment|rat
Murids have evolved a unique defense mechanism termed degloving that allows for escape from predation through the loss of the outermost integumentary layer on the tail|rat
However, this mechanism is associated with multiple pathologies that have been the subject of investigation.Multiple studies have explored the thermoregulatory capacity of rodent tails by subjecting test organisms to varying levels of physical activity and quantifying heat conduction via the animals' tails|rat
One study demonstrated a significant disparity in heat dissipation from a rat's tail relative to its abdomen|rat
This observation was attributed to the higher proportion of vascularity in the tail, as well as its higher surface-area-to-volume ratio, which directly relates to heat's ability to dissipate via the skin|rat
These findings were confirmed in a separate study analyzing the relationships of heat storage and mechanical efficiency in rodents that exercise in warm environments|rat
In this study, the tail was a focal point in measuring heat accumulation and modulation.On the other hand, the tail's ability to function as a proprioceptive sensor and modulator has also been investigated|rat
As aforementioned, the tail demonstrates a high degree of muscularization and subsequent innervation that ostensibly collaborate in orienting the organism|rat
Specifically, this is accomplished by coordinated flexion and extension of tail muscles to produce slight shifts in the organism's center of mass, orientation, etc., which ultimately assists it with achieving a state of proprioceptive balance in its environment|rat
Further mechanobiological investigations of the constituent tendons in the tail of the rat have identified multiple factors that influence how the organism navigates its environment with this structure|rat
A particular example is that of a study in which the morphology of these tendons is explicated in detail|rat
Namely, cell viability tests of tendons of the rat's tail demonstrate a higher proportion of living fibroblasts that produce the collagen for these fibers|rat
As in humans, these tendons contain a high density of golgi tendon organs that help the animal assess stretching of muscle in situ and adjust accordingly by relaying the information to higher cortical areas associated with balance, proprioception, and movement.The characteristic tail of murids also displays a unique defense mechanism known as degloving in which the outer layer of the integument can be detached in order to facilitate the animal's escape from a predator|rat
This evolutionary selective pressure has persisted despite a multitude of pathologies that can manifest upon shedding part of the tail and exposing more interior elements to the environment|rat
Paramount among these are bacterial and viral infection, as the high density of vascular tissue within the tail becomes exposed upon avulsion or similar injury to the structure|rat
The degloving response is a nocifensive response, meaning that it occurs when the animal is subjected to acute pain, such as when a predator snatches the organism by the tail.|rat
Specially bred rats have been kept as pets at least since the late 19th century|rat
Pet rats are typically variants of the species brown rat, but black rats and giant pouched rats are also sometimes kept|rat
Pet rats behave differently from their wild counterparts depending on how many generations they have been kept as pets|rat
Pet rats do not pose any more of a health risk than pets such as cats or dogs|rat
Tamed rats are generally friendly and can be taught to perform selected behaviors.|rat
Selective breeding has brought about different color and marking varieties in rats|rat
Genetic mutations have also created different fur types, such as rex and hairless|rat
Congenital malformation in selective breeding have created the dumbo rat, a popular pet choice due to their low, saucer-shaped ears|rat
A breeding standard exists for rat fanciers wishing to breed and show their rat at a rat show.|rat
In 1895, Clark University in Worcester, Massachusetts, established a population of domestic albino brown rats to study the effects of diet and for other physiological studies|rat
Over the years, rats have been used in many experimental studies, adding to our understanding of genetics, diseases, the effects of drugs, and other topics that have provided a great benefit for the health and wellbeing of humankind.The aortic arches of the rat are among the most commonly studied in murine models due to marked anatomical homology to the human cardiovascular system|rat
Both rat and human aortic arches exhibit subsequent branching of the brachiocephalic trunk, left common carotid artery, and left subclavian artery, as well as geometrically similar, nonplanar curvature in the aortic branches|rat
Aortic arches studied in rats exhibit abnormalities similar to those of humans, including altered pulmonary arteries and double or absent aortic arches|rat
Despite existing anatomical analogy in the inthrathoracic position of the heart itself, the murine model of the heart and its structures remains a valuable tool for studies of human cardiovascular conditions.The rat's larynx has been used in experimentations that involve inhalation toxicity, allograft rejection, and irradiation responses|rat
One experiment described four features of the rat's larynx|rat
The first being the location and attachments of the thyroarytenoid muscle, the alar cricoarytenoid muscle, and the superior cricoarytenoid muscle, the other of the newly named muscle that ran from the arytenoid to a midline tubercle on the cricoid|rat
The newly named muscles were not seen in the human larynx|rat
In addition, the location and configuration of the laryngeal alar cartilage was described|rat
The second feature was that the way the newly named muscles appear to be familiar to those in the human larynx|rat
The third feature was that a clear understanding of how MEPs are distributed in each of the laryngeal muscles was helpful in understanding the effects of botulinum toxin injection|rat
The MEPs in the posterior|rat
cricoarytenoid muscle were focused mostly at the midbelly|rat
In addition, the medial thyroarytenoid muscle were focused at the midbelly while the lateral thyroarytenoid muscle MEPs were focused at the anterior third of the belly|rat
The fourth and final feature that was cleared up was how the MEPs were distributed in the thyroarytenoid muscle.Laboratory rats have also proved valuable in psychological studies of learning and other mental processes (Barnett 2002), as well as to understand group behavior and overcrowding (with the work of John B|rat
Calhoun on behavioral sink)|rat
A 2007 study found rats to possess metacognition, a mental ability previously only documented in humans and some primates.Domestic rats differ from wild rats in many ways|rat
They are calmer and less likely to bite; they can tolerate greater crowding; they breed earlier and produce more offspring; and their brains, livers, kidneys, adrenal glands, and hearts are smaller (Barnett 2002).|rat
Brown rats are often used as model organisms for scientific research|rat
Since the publication of the rat genome sequence, and other advances, such as the creation of a rat SNP chip, and the production of knockout rats, the laboratory rat has become a useful genetic tool, although not as popular as mice|rat
When it comes to conducting tests related to intelligence, learning, and drug abuse, rats are a popular choice due to their high intelligence, ingenuity, aggressiveness, and adaptability|rat
"Their psychology seems in many ways similar to that of humans.Entirely new breeds or ""lines"" of brown rats, such as the Wistar rat, have been bred for use in laboratories"|rat
Much of the genome of Rattus norvegicus has been sequenced.|rat
"Early studies found evidence both for and against measurable intelligence using the ""g factor"" in rats"|rat
Part of the difficulty of understanding animal cognition generally, is determining what to measure|rat
One aspect of intelligence is the ability to learn, which can be measured using a maze like the T-maze|rat
Experiments done in the 1920s showed that some rats performed better than others in maze tests, and if these rats were selectively bred, their offspring also performed better, suggesting that in rats an ability to learn was heritable in some way.|rat
Rats have been used as working animals|rat
Tasks for working rats include the sniffing of gunpowder residue, demining, acting and animal-assisted therapy.|rat
Rats have a keen sense of smell and are easy to train|rat
These characteristics have been employed, for example, by the Belgian non-governmental organization APOPO, which trains rats (specifically African giant pouched rats) to detect landmines and diagnose tuberculosis through smell.|rat
Rats have long been considered deadly pests|rat
Once considered a modern myth, the rat flood in India occurs every fifty years, as armies of bamboo rats descend upon rural areas and devour everything in their path|rat
Rats have long been held up as the chief villain in the spread of the Bubonic Plague; however, recent studies show that rats alone could not account for the rapid spread of the disease through Europe in the Middle Ages|rat
Still, the Centers for Disease Control does list nearly a dozen diseases directly linked to rats.|rat
Most urban areas battle rat infestations|rat
A 2015 study by the American Housing Survey (AHS) found that eighteen percent of homes in Philadelphia showed evidence of rodents|rat
Boston, New York City, and Washington, D.C., also demonstrated significant rodent infestations|rat
Indeed, rats in New York City are famous for their size and prevalence|rat
The urban legend that the rat population in Manhattan equals that of its human population was definitively refuted by Robert Sullivan in his book Rats but illustrates New Yorkers' awareness of the presence, and on occasion boldness and cleverness, of the rodents|rat
"New York has specific regulations for eradicating rats; multifamily residences and commercial businesses must use a specially trained and licensed rat catcher.Chicago was declared the ""rattiest city"" in the US by the pest control company Orkin in 2020, for the sixth consecutive time"|rat
It's followed by Los Angeles, New York, Washington, DC, and San Francisco|rat
To help combat the problem, a Chicago animal shelter has placed more than 1000 feral cats (sterilized and vaccinated) outside of homes and businesses since 2012, where they hunt and catch rats while also providing a deterrent simply by their presence.Rats have the ability to swim up sewer pipes into toilets|rat
Rats will infest any area that provides shelter and easy access to sources of food and water, including under sinks, near garbage, and inside walls or cabinets.|rat
When introduced into locations where rats previously did not exist, they can wreak an enormous degree of environmental degradation|rat
Rattus rattus, the black rat, is considered to be one of the world's worst invasive species|rat
Also known as the ship rat, it has been carried worldwide as a stowaway on seagoing vessels for millennia and has usually accompanied men to any new area visited or settled by human beings by sea|rat
The similar species Rattus norvegicus, the brown rat or wharf rat, has also been carried worldwide by ships in recent centuries.The ship or wharf rat has contributed to the extinction of many species of wildlife, including birds, small mammals, reptiles, invertebrates, and plants, especially on islands|rat
True rats are omnivorous, capable of eating a wide range of plant and animal foods, and have a very high birth rate|rat
When introduced to a new area, they quickly reproduce to take advantage of the new food supply|rat
In particular, they prey on the eggs and young of forest birds, which on isolated islands often have no other predators and thus have no fear of predators|rat
Some experts believe that rats are to blame for between forty percent and sixty percent of all seabird and reptile extinctions, with ninety percent of those occurring on islands|rat
Thus man has indirectly caused the extinction of many species by accidentally introducing rats to new areas.|rat
Rats are found in nearly all areas of Earth which are inhabited by human beings|rat
The only rat-free continent is Antarctica, which is too cold for rat survival outdoors, and its lack of human habitation does not provide buildings to shelter them from the weather|rat
However, rats have been introduced to many of the islands near Antarctica, and because of their destructive effect on native flora and fauna, efforts to eradicate them are ongoing|rat
In particular, Bird Island (just off rat-infested South Georgia Island), where breeding seabirds could be badly affected if rats were introduced, is subject to special measures and regularly monitored for rat invasions.As part of island restoration, some islands' rat populations have been eradicated to protect or restore the ecology|rat
Hawadax Island, Alaska was declared rat free after 229 years and Campbell Island, New Zealand after almost 200 years|rat
Breaksea Island in New Zealand was declared rat free in 1988 after an eradication campaign based on a successful trial on the smaller Hawea Island nearby.|rat
"In January 2015, an international ""Rat Team"" set sail from the Falkland Islands for the British Overseas Territory of South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands on board a ship carrying three helicopters and 100 tons of rat poison with the objective of ""reclaiming the island for its seabirds"""|rat
Rats have wiped out more than 90% of the seabirds on South Georgia, and the sponsors hope that once the rats are gone, it will regain its former status as home to the greatest concentration of seabirds in the world|rat
"The South Georgia Heritage Trust, which organized the mission describes it as ""five times larger than any other rodent eradication attempted worldwide"""|rat
That would be true if it were not for the rat control program in Alberta (see below).|rat
The Canadian province of Alberta is notable for being the largest inhabited area on Earth which is free of true rats due to very aggressive government rat control policies|rat
It has large numbers of native pack rats, also called bushy-tailed wood rats, but they are forest-dwelling vegetarians which are much less destructive than true rats.Alberta was settled relatively late in North American history and only became a province in 1905|rat
Black rats cannot survive in its climate at all, and brown rats must live near people and in their structures to survive the winters|rat
There are numerous predators in Canada's vast natural areas which will eat non-native rats, so it took until 1950 for invading rats to make their way over land from Eastern Canada|rat
Immediately upon their arrival at the eastern border with Saskatchewan, the Alberta government implemented an extremely aggressive rat control program to stop them from advancing further|rat
A systematic detection and eradication system was used throughout a control zone about 600 kilometres (400 mi) long and 30 kilometres (20 mi) wide along the eastern border to eliminate rat infestations before the rats could spread further into the province|rat
Shotguns, bulldozers, high explosives, poison gas, and incendiaries were used to destroy rats|rat
Numerous farm buildings were destroyed in the process|rat
Initially, tons of arsenic trioxide were spread around thousands of farm yards to poison rats, but soon after the program commenced the rodenticide and medical drug warfarin was introduced, which is much safer for people and more effective at killing rats than arsenic.Forceful government control measures, strong public support and enthusiastic citizen participation continue to keep rat infestations to a minimum|rat
The effectiveness has been aided by a similar but newer program in Saskatchewan which prevents rats from even reaching the Alberta border|rat
Alberta still employs an armed rat patrol to control rats along Alberta's borders|rat
About ten single rats are found and killed per year, and occasionally a large localized infestation has to be dug out with heavy machinery, but the number of permanent rat infestations is zero.|rat
The rat (sometimes referred to as a mouse) is the first of the twelve animals of the Chinese zodiac|rat
People born in this year are expected to possess qualities associated with rats, including creativity, intelligence, honesty, generosity, ambition, a quick temper and wastefulness|rat
"People born in a year of the rat are said to get along well with ""monkeys"" and ""dragons"", and to get along poorly with ""horses""."|rat
In Indian tradition, rats are seen as the vehicle of Ganesha, and a rat's statue is always found in a temple of Ganesh|rat
In the northwestern Indian city of Deshnoke, the rats at the Karni Mata Temple are held to be destined for reincarnation as Sadhus (Hindu holy men)|rat
The attending priests feed milk and grain to the rats, of which the pilgrims also partake.|rat
European associations with the rat are generally negative|rat
"For instance, ""Rats!"" is used as a substitute for various vulgar interjections in the English language"|rat
These associations do not draw, per se, from any biological or behavioral trait of the rat, but possibly from the association of rats (and fleas) with the 14th-century medieval plague called the Black Death|rat
Rats are seen as vicious, unclean, parasitic animals that steal food and spread disease|rat
However, some people in European cultures keep rats as pets and conversely find them to be tame, clean, intelligent, and playful.|rat
Rats are often used in scientific experiments; animal rights activists allege the treatment of rats in this context is cruel|rat
"The term ""lab rat"" is used, typically in a self-effacing manner, to describe a person whose job function requires them to spend a majority of their work time engaged in bench-level research (such as postgraduate students in the sciences)."|rat
Rats are frequently blamed for damaging food supplies and other goods, or spreading disease|rat
Their reputation has carried into common parlance|rat
"in the English language, ""rat"" is often an insult or is generally used to signify an unscrupulous character; it is also used, as a synonym for the term nark, to mean an individual who works as a police informant or who has turned state's evidence"|rat
"Writer/director Preston Sturges created the humorous alias ""Ratskywatsky"" for a soldier who seduced, impregnated, and abandoned the heroine of his 1944 film, The Miracle of Morgan's Creek"|rat
"It is a term (noun and verb) in criminal slang for an informant – ""to rat on someone"" is to betray them by informing the authorities of a crime or misdeed they committed"|rat
"Describing a person as ""rat-like"" usually implies he or she is unattractive and suspicious."|rat
Depictions of rats in fiction are historically inaccurate and negative|rat
The most common falsehood is the squeaking almost always heard in otherwise realistic portrayals (i.e|rat
nonanthropomorphic)|rat
While the recordings may be of actual squeaking rats, the noise is uncommon – they may do so only if distressed, hurt, or annoyed|rat
Normal vocalizations are very high-pitched, well outside the range of human hearing|rat
Rats are also often cast in vicious and aggressive roles when in fact, their shyness helps keep them undiscovered for so long in an infested home.|rat
The actual portrayals of rats vary from negative to positive with a majority in the negative and ambiguous|rat
The rat plays a villain in several mouse societies; from Brian Jacques's Redwall and Robin Jarvis's The Deptford Mice, to the roles of Disney's Professor Ratigan and Kate DiCamillo's Roscuro and Botticelli|rat
They have often been used as a mechanism in horror; being the titular evil in stories like The Rats or H.P|rat
Lovecraft's The Rats in the Walls and in films like Willard and Ben|rat
Another terrifying use of rats is as a method of torture, for instance in Room 101 in George Orwell's Nineteen Eighty-Four or The Pit and the Pendulum by Edgar Allan Poe.|rat
Selfish helpfulness —those willing to help for a price— has also been attributed to fictional rats|rat
Templeton, from E|rat

Notable examples include the society created by O'Brien's Mrs|rat
Frisby and the Rats of NIMH, and others include Doctor Rat, and Rizzo the Rat from The Muppets|rat
"Pixar's 2007 animated film Ratatouille is about a rat described by Roger Ebert as ""earnest.."|rat
"lovable, determined, [and] gifted"" who lives with a Parisian garbage-boy-turned-chef.Mon oncle d'Amérique (""My American Uncle""), a 1980 French film, illustrates Henri Laborit's theories on evolutionary psychology and human behaviors by using short sequences in the storyline showing lab rat experiments."|rat
In Harry Turtledove's science fiction novel Homeward Bound, humans unintentionally introduce rats to the ecology at the home world of an alien race which previously invaded Earth and introduced some of its own fauna into its environment|rat

Bertram Chandler pitted the space-bound protagonist of a long series of novels, Commodore Grimes, against giant, intelligent rats who took over several stellar systems and enslaved their human inhabitants|rat
"""The Stainless Steel Rat"" is nickname of the (human) protagonist of a series of humorous science fiction novels written by Harry Harrison."|rat
Wererats, therianthropic creatures able to take the shape of a rat, have appeared in the fantasy or horror genre since the 1970s|rat
The term is a neologism coined in analogy to werewolf|rat
The concept has since become common in role playing games like Dungeons & Dragons and fantasy fiction like the Anita Blake series.|rat
"One of the oldest and most historic stories about rats is ""The Pied Piper of Hamelin"", in which a rat-catcher leads away an infestation with enchanted music"|rat
The piper is later refused payment, so he in turn leads away the town's children|rat
This tale, traced to Germany around the late 13th century, has inspired adaptations in film, theatre, literature, and even opera|rat
The subject of much research, some theories have intertwined the tale with events related to the Black Plague, in which black rats played an important role|rat
Fictional works based on the tale that focus heavily on the rat aspect include Pratchett's The Amazing Maurice and his Educated Rodents, and Belgian graphic novel Le Bal du Rat Mort (The Ball of the Dead Rat)|rat
"Furthermore, a linguistic phenomenon when a wh-expression drags with it an entire encompassing phrase to the front of the clause has been named pied-piping after ""Pied Piper of Hamlin"" (see also pied-piping with inversion)."|rat

The tiger (Panthera tigris) is the largest living cat species and a member of the genus Panthera|tiger
It is most recognisable for its dark vertical stripes on orange fur with a white underside|tiger
An apex predator, it primarily preys on ungulates such as deer and wild boar|tiger
It is territorial and generally a solitary but social predator, requiring large contiguous areas of habitat, which support its requirements for prey and rearing of its offspring|tiger
Tiger cubs stay with their mother for about two years, then become independent and leave their mother's home range to establish their own.|tiger
The tiger was first scientifically described in 1758 and once ranged widely from the Eastern Anatolia Region in the west to the Amur River basin in the east, and in the south from the foothills of the Himalayas to Bali in the Sunda Islands|tiger
Since the early 20th century, tiger populations have lost at least 93% of their historic range and have been extirpated from Western and Central Asia, the islands of Java and Bali, and in large areas of Southeast and South Asia and China|tiger
Today, the tiger's range is fragmented, stretching from Siberian temperate forests to subtropical and tropical forests on the Indian subcontinent, Indochina and Sumatra.|tiger
The tiger is listed as Endangered on the IUCN Red List|tiger
As of 2015, the global wild tiger population was estimated to number between 3,062 and 3,948 mature individuals, with most of the populations living in small isolated pockets|tiger
India currently hosts the largest tiger population|tiger
Major reasons for population decline are habitat destruction, habitat fragmentation and poaching|tiger
Tigers are also victims of human–wildlife conflict, particularly in range countries with a high human population density.|tiger
The tiger is among the most recognisable and popular of the world's charismatic megafauna|tiger
It featured prominently in the ancient mythology and folklore of cultures throughout its historic range, and continues to be depicted in modern films and literature, appearing on many flags, coats of arms and as mascots for sporting teams|tiger
The tiger is the national animal of India, Bangladesh, Malaysia and South Korea.|tiger
The Middle English tigre and Old English tigras derive from Old French tigre, from Latin tigris|tiger
In 1758, Carl Linnaeus described the tiger in his work Systema Naturae and gave it the scientific name Felis tigris|tiger
In 1929, the British taxonomist Reginald Innes Pocock subordinated the species under the genus Panthera using the scientific name Panthera tigris.|tiger
Following Linnaeus's first descriptions of the species, several tiger specimens were described and proposed as subspecies|tiger
The validity of several tiger subspecies was questioned in 1999|tiger
Most putative subspecies described in the 19th and 20th centuries were distinguished on basis of fur length and colouration, striping patterns and body size, hence characteristics that vary widely within populations|tiger
Morphologically, tigers from different regions vary little, and gene flow between populations in those regions is considered to have been possible during the Pleistocene|tiger
Therefore, it was proposed to recognize only two tiger subspecies as valid, namely P|tiger
t|tiger
tigris in mainland Asia, and P|tiger
t|tiger
sondaica in the Greater Sunda Islands.Results of craniological analysis of 111 tiger skulls from Southeast Asian range countries indicate that Sumatran tiger skulls differ from Indochinese and Javan tiger skulls, whereas Bali tiger skulls are similar in size to Javan tiger skulls|tiger
The authors proposed to classify the Sumatran and Javan tigers as distinct species, P|tiger
sumatrae and P|tiger
sondaica, with the Bali tiger as subspecies P|tiger
sondaica balica.In 2015, morphological, ecological, and molecular traits of all putative tiger subspecies were analysed in a combined approach|tiger
Results support distinction of the two evolutionary groups continental and Sunda tigers|tiger
The authors proposed recognition of only two subspecies, namely P|tiger
t|tiger
tigris comprising the Bengal, Malayan, Indochinese, South Chinese, Siberian and Caspian tiger populations, and P|tiger
t|tiger
sondaica comprising the Javan, Bali and Sumatran tiger populations|tiger
The authors also noted that this reclassification will affect tiger conservation management|tiger
The nominate subspecies P|tiger
t|tiger
tigris constitutes two clades:|tiger
a southern clade composed of all other mainland populations.One conservation specialist welcomed this proposal as it would make captive breeding programmes and future rewilding of zoo-born tigers easier|tiger
One geneticist was sceptical of this study and maintained that the currently recognised nine subspecies can be distinguished genetically.In 2017, the Cat Classification Task Force of the IUCN Cat Specialist Group revised felid taxonomy and recognized the tiger populations in continental Asia as P|tiger
t|tiger
tigris, and those in the Sunda Islands as P|tiger
t|tiger
sondaica|tiger
This two-subspecies view has been largely rejected by researchers|tiger
Results of a 2018 whole-genome sequencing of 32 specimens support six monophyletic tiger clades corresponding with the living subspecies and indicate that the most recent common ancestor lived about 110,000 years ago.|tiger
The following tables are based on the classification of the species Panthera tigris provided in Mammal Species of the World|tiger
It also reflects the classification used by the Cat Classification Task Force in 2017:|tiger
The tiger's closest living relatives were previously thought to be the Panthera species lion, leopard and jaguar|tiger
Results of genetic analysis indicate that about 2.88 million years ago, the tiger and the snow leopard lineages diverged from the other Panthera species, and that both may be more closely related to each other than to the lion, leopard and jaguar.|tiger
The geographic origin of the Panthera is most likely northern Central Asia|tiger
The tiger–snow leopard lineage dispersed in Southeast Asia during the Miocene.Panthera zdanskyi is considered to be a sister taxon of the modern tiger|tiger
It lived at the beginning of the Pleistocene about two million years ago, its fossil remains were excavated in Gansu of northwestern China|tiger
"It was smaller and more ""primitive"", but functionally and ecologically similar to the modern tiger"|tiger
It is disputed as to whether it had the striping pattern|tiger
Northwestern China is thought to be the origin of the tiger lineage|tiger
Tigers grew in size, possibly in response to adaptive radiations of prey species like deer and bovids, which may have occurred in Southeast Asia during the Early Pleistocene.Panthera tigris trinilensis lived about 1.2 million years ago and is known from fossils excavated near Trinil in Java|tiger
The Wanhsien, Ngandong, Trinil, and Japanese tigers became extinct in prehistoric times|tiger
Tigers reached India and northern Asia in the late Pleistocene, reaching eastern Beringia, Japan, and Sakhalin|tiger
Some fossil skulls are morphologically distinct from lion skulls, which could indicate tiger presence in Alaska during the last glacial period, about 100,000 years ago.In the Ille Cave on the island of Palawan, two articulated phalanx bones were found amidst an assemblage of other animal bones and stone tools|tiger
They were smaller than mainland tiger fossils, possibly due to insular dwarfism|tiger
It has been speculated that the tiger parts were either imported from elsewhere, or that the tiger colonised Palawan from Borneo before the Holocene|tiger
Fossil remains of tigers were also excavated in Sri Lanka, China, Japan and Sarawak dating to the Late Pliocene, Pleistocene and Early Holocene|tiger
The Bornean tiger was apparently present in Borneo between the Late Pleistocene and the Holocene, but whether it went extinct in prehistoric or recent times has not been resolved.Results of a phylogeographic study indicate that all living tigers had a common ancestor 108,000 to 72,000 years ago|tiger
The potential tiger range during the late Pleistocene and Holocene was predicted applying ecological niche modelling based on more than 500 tiger locality records combined with bioclimatic data|tiger
The resulting model shows a contiguous tiger range at the Last Glacial Maximum, indicating gene flow between tiger populations in mainland Asia|tiger
The Caspian tiger population was likely connected to the Bengal tiger population through corridors below elevations of 4,000 m (13,000 ft) in the Hindu Kush|tiger
The tiger populations on the Sunda Islands and mainland Asia were possibly separated during interglacial periods.The tiger's full genome sequence was published in 2013|tiger
It was found to have similar repeat composition to other cat genomes and an appreciably conserved synteny.|tiger
Captive tigers were bred with lions to create hybrids called liger and tigon|tiger
They share physical and behavioural qualities of both parent species|tiger
Breeding hybrids is now discouraged due to the emphasis on conservation.|tiger
The liger is a cross between a male lion and a tigress|tiger
Ligers are typically between 10 and 12 ft (3.0 and 3.7 m) in length, and weigh between 800 and 1,000 lb (360 and 450 kg) or more|tiger
Because the lion sire passes on a growth-promoting gene, but the corresponding growth-inhibiting gene from the female tiger is absent, ligers grow far larger than either parent species.The less common tigon is a cross between a lioness and a male tiger|tiger
Because the male tiger does not pass on a growth-promoting gene and the lioness passes on a growth inhibiting gene, tigons are around the same size as their parents|tiger
Some females are fertile and have occasionally given birth to litigons when mated to a male Asiatic lion.|tiger
The tiger has a muscular body with powerful forelimbs, a large head and a tail that is about half the length of its body|tiger
Its pelage is dense and heavy, and colouration varies between shades of orange and brown with white ventral areas and distinctive vertical black stripes; the patterns of which are unique in each individual|tiger
Stripes are likely advantageous for camouflage in vegetation such as long grass with strong vertical patterns of light and shade|tiger
The tiger is one of only a few striped cat species; it is not known why spotted patterns and rosettes are the more common camouflage pattern among felids|tiger
The orange colour may also aid in camouflage as the tiger's prey are dichromats, and thus may perceive the cat as green and blended in with the vegetation.A tiger's coat pattern is still visible when it is shaved|tiger
This is not due to skin pigmentation, but to the stubble and hair follicles embedded in the skin|tiger
It has a mane-like heavy growth of fur around the neck and jaws and long whiskers, especially in males|tiger
The pupils are circular with yellow irises|tiger
The small, rounded ears have a prominent white spot on the back, surrounded by black|tiger
These spots are thought to play an important role in intraspecific communication.The tiger's skull is similar to a lion's skull, with the frontal region usually less depressed or flattened, and a slightly longer postorbital region|tiger
The lion skull shows broader nasal openings|tiger
Due to the variation in skull sizes of the two species, the structure of the lower jaw is a reliable indicator for their identification|tiger
The tiger has fairly stout teeth; its somewhat curved canines are the longest among living felids with a crown height of up to 90 mm (3.5 in).|tiger
There is notable sexual dimorphism between male and female tigers, with the latter being consistently smaller|tiger
The size difference between them is proportionally greater in the large tiger subspecies, with males weighing up to 1.7 times more than females|tiger
Males also have wider forepaw pads, enabling sex to be identified from tracks|tiger
It has been hypothesised that body size of different tiger populations may be correlated with climate and be explained by thermoregulation and Bergmann's rule, or by distribution and size of available prey species.Generally, males vary in total length from 250 to 390 cm (8.2 to 12.8 ft) and weigh between 90 and 300 kg (200 and 660 lb) with skull length ranging from 316 to 383 mm (12.4 to 15.1 in)|tiger
Females vary in total length from 200 to 275 cm (6.56 to 9.02 ft), weigh 65 to 167 kg (143 to 368 lb) with skull length ranging from 268 to 318 mm (0.879 to 1.043 ft)|tiger
In either sex, the tail represents about 0.6 to 1.1 m (24 to 43 in) of the total length|tiger
The Bengal and Siberian tigers are amongst the tallest cats in shoulder height|tiger
They are also ranked among the biggest cats that have ever existed reaching weights of more than 300 kg (660 lb)|tiger
The tigers of the Sunda islands are smaller and less heavy than tigers in mainland Asia, rarely exceeding 142 kg (313 lb) in weight.|tiger
There are three other colour variants – white, golden and nearly stripeless snow white – that are now virtually non-existent in the wild due to the reduction of wild tiger populations, but continue in captive populations|tiger
The white tiger has white fur and sepia-brown stripes|tiger
The golden tiger has a pale golden pelage with a blond tone and reddish-brown stripes|tiger
The snow white tiger is a morph with extremely faint stripes and a pale reddish-brown ringed tail|tiger
Both snow white and golden tigers are homozygous for CORIN gene mutations|tiger
A black tiger is a colour variant due to pseudo-melanism|tiger
They have thick stripes close together so that the background colour is barely visible between stripes.The white tiger lacks pheomelanin (which creates the orange colour), and has dark sepia-brown stripes and blue eyes|tiger
This altered pigmentation is caused by a mutant gene that is inherited as an autosomal recessive trait, which is determined by a white locus|tiger
It is not an albino, as the dark pigments are scarcely affected|tiger
The mutation changes a single amino acid in the transporter protein SLC45A2|tiger
Both parents need to have the allele for whiteness to have white cubs.|tiger
Between the early and mid 20th century, white tigers were recorded and shot in the Indian states of Odisha, Bihar, Assam and in the area of Rewa, Madhya Pradesh|tiger
The local maharaja started breeding tigers in the early 1950s and kept a white male tiger together with its normal-coloured daughter; they had white cubs.|tiger
To preserve this recessive trait, only a few white individuals were used in captive breeding, which led to a high degree of inbreeding|tiger
Inbreeding depression is the main reason for many health problems of captive white tigers, including strabismus, stillbirth, deformities and premature death.|tiger
Other physical defects include cleft palate and scoliosis.The Tiger Species Survival Plan has condemned the breeding of white tigers, alleging they are of mixed ancestry and of unknown lineage|tiger
The genes responsible for white colouration are represented by 0.001% of the population|tiger
The disproportionate growth in numbers of white tigers points to inbreeding among homozygous recessive individuals|tiger
This would lead to inbreeding depression and loss of genetic variability.|tiger
The tiger historically ranged from eastern Turkey and Transcaucasia to the coast of the Sea of Japan, and from South Asia across Southeast Asia to the Indonesian islands of Sumatra, Java and Bali|tiger
Since the end of the last glacial period, it was probably restricted by periods of deep snow lasting longer than six months|tiger
Currently, it occurs in less than 6% of its historical range, as it has been extirpated from Southwest and Central Asia, large parts of Southeast and East Asia|tiger
It now mainly occurs in the Indian subcontinent, the Indochinese Peninsula, Sumatra and the Russian Far East|tiger
In China and Myanmar, breeding populations appear to rely on immigration from neighbouring countries while its status in the Korean Peninsula is unknown.The tiger is essentially associated with forest habitats|tiger
Tiger populations thrive where populations of wild cervids, bovids and suids are stable.|tiger
Records in Central Asia indicate that it occurred foremost in Tugay riverine forests along the Atrek, Amu Darya, Syr Darya, Hari, Chu and Ili Rivers and their tributaries|tiger
In the Caucasus, it inhabited hilly and lowland forests.|tiger
Historical records in Iran are known only from the southern coast of the Caspian Sea and adjacent Alborz Mountains|tiger
In the Amur-Ussuri region, it inhabits Korean pine and temperate broadleaf and mixed forests, where riparian forests provide food and water, and serve as dispersal corridors for both tiger and ungulates.|tiger
On the Indian subcontinent, it inhabits mainly tropical and subtropical moist broadleaf forests, moist evergreen forests, tropical dry forests and the swamp forests of the Sundarbans|tiger
In the Eastern Himalayas, tigers were documented in temperate forest up to an elevation of 4,200 m (13,800 ft) in Bhutan and of 3,630 m (11,910 ft) in the Mishmi Hills|tiger
In Thailand, it lives in deciduous and evergreen forests|tiger
In Laos, 14 tigers were documented in semi-evergreen and evergreen forest interspersed with grassland in Nam Et-Phou Louey National Protected Area during surveys from 2013 to 2017|tiger
In Sumatra, tiger populations range from lowland peat swamp forests to rugged montane forests.|tiger
When not subject to human disturbance, the tiger is mainly diurnal|tiger
It does not often climb trees but cases have been recorded|tiger
It is a strong swimmer and often bathes in ponds, lakes and rivers, thus keeping cool in the heat of the day|tiger
Individuals can cross rivers up to 7 km (4.3 mi) wide and can swim up to 29 km (18 mi) in a day|tiger
During the 1980s, a tiger was observed frequently hunting prey through deep lake water in Ranthambhore National Park.The tiger is a long-ranging species, and individuals disperse over distances of up to 650 km (400 mi) to reach tiger populations in other areas|tiger
Radio-collared tigers in Chitwan National Park started dispersing from their natal areas earliest at the age of 19 months|tiger
Four females dispersed between 0 and 43.2 km (0.0 and 26.8 mi), and 10 males between 9.5 and 65.7 km (5.9 and 40.8 mi)|tiger
None of them crossed open cultivated areas that were more than 10 km (6.2 mi) wide, but moved through forested habitat.Adult tigers lead largely solitary lives|tiger
They establish and maintain territories but have much wider home ranges within which they roam|tiger
Resident adults of either sex generally confine their movements to their home ranges, within which they satisfy their needs and those of their growing cubs|tiger
Individuals sharing the same area are aware of each other's movements and activities|tiger
The size of the home range mainly depends on prey abundance, geographic area and sex of the individual|tiger
In India, home ranges appear to be 50 to 1,000 km2 (19 to 386 sq mi) while in Manchuria, they range from 500 to 4,000 km2 (190 to 1,540 sq mi)|tiger
In Nepal, defended territories are recorded to be 19 to 151 km2 (7.3 to 58.3 sq mi) for males and 10 to 51 km2 (3.9 to 19.7 sq mi) for females.Young female tigers establish their first territories close to their mother's|tiger
The overlap between the female and her mother's territory reduces with time|tiger
Males, however, migrate further than their female counterparts and set out at a younger age to mark out their own area|tiger
A young male acquires territory either by seeking out an area devoid of other male tigers, or by living as a transient in another male's territory until he is older and strong enough to challenge the resident male|tiger
Young males seeking to establish themselves thereby comprise the highest mortality rate (30–35% per year) amongst adult tigers.To identify his territory, the male marks trees by spraying urine, anal gland secretions, marking trails with feces and marking trees or the ground with their claws|tiger
"Females also use these ""scrapes"", urine and fecal markings"|tiger
Scent markings of this type allow an individual to pick up information on another's identity, sex and reproductive status|tiger
Females in oestrus will signal their availability by scent marking more frequently and increasing their vocalisations.Although for the most part avoiding each other, tigers are not always territorial and relationships between individuals can be complex|tiger
An adult of either sex will sometimes share its kill with others, even those who may not be related to them|tiger
George Schaller observed a male share a kill with two females and four cubs|tiger
Unlike male lions, male tigers allow females and cubs to feed on the kill before the male is finished with it; all involved generally seem to behave amicably, in contrast to the competitive behaviour shown by a lion pride|tiger
Stephen Mills described a social feeding event in Ranthambore National Park:|tiger
A dominant tigress they called Padmini killed a 250 kg (550 lb) male nilgai – a very large antelope|tiger
They found her at the kill just after dawn with her three 14-month-old cubs, and they watched uninterrupted for the next ten hours|tiger
During this period the family was joined by two adult females and one adult male, all offspring from Padmini's previous litters, and by two unrelated tigers, one female the other unidentified|tiger
By three o'clock there were no fewer than nine tigers round the kill.|tiger
Male tigers are generally more intolerant of other males within their territories than females are of other females|tiger
Territory disputes are usually solved by displays of intimidation rather than outright aggression|tiger
Several such incidents have been observed in which the subordinate tiger yielded defeat by rolling onto its back and showing its belly in a submissive posture|tiger
Once dominance has been established, a male may tolerate a subordinate within his range, as long as they do not live in too close quarters|tiger
The most aggressive disputes tend to occur between two males when a female is in oestrus, and sometimes results in the death of one of the males.|tiger
"Facial expressions include the ""defense threat"", where an individual bares its teeth, flattens its ears and its pupils enlarge"|tiger
Both males and females show a flehmen response, a characteristic grimace, when sniffing urine markings, but flehmen is more often associated with males detecting the markings made by tigresses in oestrus|tiger
Like other Panthera, tigers roar, particularly in aggressive situations, during the mating season or when making a kill|tiger
There are two different roars|tiger
"the ""true"" roar is made using the hyoid apparatus and forced through an open mouth as it progressively closes, and the shorter, harsher ""coughing"" roar is made with the mouth open and teeth exposed"|tiger
"The ""true"" roar can be heard at up to 3 km (1.9 mi) away and is sometimes emitted three or four times in succession"|tiger
When tense, tigers will moan, a sound similar to a roar but more subdued and made when the mouth is partially or completely closed|tiger
Moaning can be heard 400 m (1,300 ft) away|tiger
Chuffing—soft, low-frequency snorting similar to purring in smaller cats—is heard in more friendly situations|tiger
Other vocal communications include grunts, woofs, snarls, miaows, hisses and growls.|tiger
In the wild, tigers mostly feed on large and medium-sized mammals, particularly ungulates weighing 60–250 kg (130–550 lb)|tiger
The most significantly preferred species are sambar deer, wapiti, barasingha and wild boar|tiger
Tigers are capable of taking down larger prey like adult gaur but will also opportunistically eat much smaller prey, such as monkeys, peafowl and other ground-based birds, hares, porcupines, and fish|tiger
They also prey on other predators, including dogs, leopards, pythons, bears, and crocodiles|tiger
Tigers generally do not prey on fully grown adult Asian elephants and Indian rhinoceros but incidents have been reported|tiger
More often, it is the more vulnerable small calves that are taken|tiger
When in close proximity to humans, tigers will also sometimes prey on such domestic livestock as cattle, horses, and donkeys|tiger
Although almost exclusively carnivorous, tigers will occasionally eat vegetation for dietary fibre such as fruit of the slow match tree.|tiger
Tigers are thought to be mainly nocturnal predators, but in areas where humans are absent, remote-controlled, hidden camera traps recorded them hunting in daylight|tiger
They generally hunt alone and ambush their prey as most other cats do, overpowering them from any angle, using their body size and strength to knock the prey off balance|tiger
Successful hunts usually require the tiger to almost simultaneously leap onto its quarry, knock it over, and grab the throat or nape with its teeth|tiger
Despite their large size, tigers can reach speeds of about 49–65 km/h (30–40 mph) but only in short bursts; consequently, tigers must be close to their prey before they break cover|tiger
If the prey senses the tiger's presence before this, the tiger usually abandons the hunt rather than chase prey or battle it head-on|tiger
Horizontal leaps of up to 10 m (33 ft) have been reported, although leaps of around half this distance are more typical|tiger
One in 2 to 20 hunts, including stalking near potential prey, ends in a successful kill.|tiger
When hunting larger animals, tigers prefer to bite the throat and use their powerful forelimbs to hold onto the prey, often simultaneously wrestling it to the ground|tiger
The tiger remains latched onto the neck until its target dies of strangulation|tiger
By this method, gaurs and water buffaloes weighing over a ton have been killed by tigers weighing about a sixth as much|tiger
Although they can kill healthy adults, tigers often select the calves or infirm of very large species|tiger
Healthy adult prey of this type can be dangerous to tackle, as long, strong horns, legs and tusks are all potentially fatal to the tiger|tiger
No other extant land predator routinely takes on prey this large on its own.With smaller prey, such as monkeys and hares, the tiger bites the nape, often breaking the spinal cord, piercing the windpipe, or severing the jugular vein or common carotid artery|tiger
Though rarely observed, some tigers have been recorded to kill prey by swiping with their paws, which are powerful enough to smash the skulls of domestic cattle, and break the backs of sloth bears.After killing their prey, tigers sometimes drag it to conceal it in vegetative cover, usually pulling it by grasping with their mouths at the site of the killing bite|tiger
This, too, can require great physical strength|tiger
In one case, after it had killed an adult gaur, a tiger was observed to drag the massive carcass over a distance of 12 m (39 ft)|tiger
When 13 men simultaneously tried to drag the same carcass later, they were unable to move it|tiger
An adult tiger can go for up to two weeks without eating, then gorge on 34 kg (75 lb) of flesh at one time|tiger
In captivity, adult tigers are fed 3 to 6 kg (6.6 to 13.2 lb) of meat a day.|tiger
Tigers usually prefer to eat self-killed prey, but eat carrion in times of scarcity and also steal prey from other large carnivores|tiger
Although predators typically avoid one another, if a prey item is under dispute or a serious competitor is encountered, displays of aggression are common|tiger
If these are not sufficient, the conflicts may turn violent; tigers may kill or even prey on competitors such as leopards, dholes, striped hyenas, wolves, bears, pythons, and mugger crocodiles on occasion|tiger
Attacks on smaller predators, such as badgers, lynxes, and foxes, are almost certainly predatory|tiger
Crocodiles, bears, and large packs of dholes may win conflicts against tigers and, in the cases of crocodiles and bears, even can kill them.The considerably smaller leopard avoids competition from tigers by hunting at different times of the day and hunting different prey|tiger
In India's Nagarhole National Park, most prey selected by leopards were from 30 to 175 kg (66 to 386 lb) against a preference for prey weighing over 176 kg (388 lb) in the tigers|tiger
The average prey weight in the two respective big cats in India was 37.6 kg (83 lb) against 91.5 kg (202 lb)|tiger
With relatively abundant prey, tigers and leopards were seen to successfully coexist without competitive exclusion or interspecies dominance hierarchies that may be more common to the African savanna, where the leopard exists with the lion|tiger
Golden jackals may feed on the tiger's kills|tiger
Tigers appear to inhabit the deep parts of a forest while smaller predators like leopards and dholes are pushed closer to the fringes.|tiger
The tiger mates all year round, but most cubs are born between March and June, with a second peak in September|tiger
Gestation ranges from 93 to 114 days, with an average of 103 to 105 days|tiger
A female is only receptive for three to six days|tiger
Mating is frequent and noisy during that time|tiger
The female gives birth in a sheltered location such as in tall grass, in a dense thicket, cave or rocky crevice|tiger
The father generally takes no part in rearing|tiger
Litters consist of two or three cubs, rarely as many as six|tiger
Cubs weigh from 780 to 1,600 g (1.72 to 3.53 lb) each at birth, and are born with eyes closed|tiger
They open their eyes when they are six to 14 days old|tiger
Their milk teeth break through at the age of about two weeks|tiger
They start to eat meat at the age of eight weeks|tiger
At around this time, females usually shift them to a new den|tiger
They make short ventures with their mother, although they do not travel with her as she roams her territory until they are older|tiger
Females lactate for five to six months|tiger
Around the time they are weaned, they start to accompany their mother on territorial walks and are taught how to hunt.A dominant cub emerges in most litters, usually a male|tiger
The dominant cub is more active than its siblings and takes the lead in their play, eventually leaving its mother and becoming independent earlier|tiger
The cubs start hunting on their own earliest at the age of 11 months, and become independent around 18 to 20 months of age|tiger
They separate from their mother at the age of two to two and a half years, but continue to grow until the age of five years|tiger
Young females reach sexual maturity at three to four years, whereas males at four to five years|tiger
Unrelated wandering male tigers often kill cubs to make the female receptive, since the tigress may give birth to another litter within five months if the cubs of the previous litter are lost|tiger
The mortality rate of tiger cubs is about 50% in the first two years|tiger
Few other predators attack tiger cubs due to the diligence and ferocity of the mother|tiger
Apart from humans and other tigers, common causes of cub mortality are starvation, freezing, and accidents|tiger
Generation length of the tiger is about eight years.|tiger
The oldest recorded captive tiger lived for 26 years.Occasionally, male tigers participate in raising cubs, usually their own, but this is extremely rare and not always well understood|tiger
In May 2015, Amur tigers were photographed by camera traps in the Sikhote-Alin Nature Reserve|tiger
The photos show a male Amur tiger pass by, followed by a female and three cubs within the span of about two minutes.|tiger
In Ranthambore, a male Bengal tiger raised and defended two orphaned female cubs after their mother had died of illness|tiger
The cubs remained under his care, he supplied them with food, protected them from his rival and sister, and apparently also trained them.|tiger
In the 1990s, a new approach to tiger conservation was developed|tiger
Tiger Conservation Units (TCUs), which are blocks of habitat that have the potential to host tiger populations in 15 habitat types within five bioregions|tiger
Altogether 143 TCUs were identified and prioritized based on size and integrity of habitat, poaching pressure and population status|tiger
They range in size from 33 to 155,829 km2 (13 to 60,166 sq mi).In 2016, an estimate of a global wild tiger population of approximately 3,890 individuals was presented during the Third Asia Ministerial Conference on Tiger Conservation|tiger
The WWF subsequently declared that the world's count of wild tigers had risen for the first time in a century.Major threats to the tiger include habitat destruction, habitat fragmentation and poaching for fur and body parts, which have simultaneously greatly reduced tiger populations in the wild|tiger
In India, only 11% of the historical tiger habitat remains due to habitat fragmentation|tiger
Demand for tiger parts for use in traditional Chinese medicine has also been cited as a major threat to tiger populations|tiger
Some estimates suggest that there are fewer than 2,500 mature breeding individuals, with no subpopulation containing more than 250 mature breeding individuals|tiger
The global wild tiger population was estimated by the World Wide Fund for Nature at 3,200 in 2011 and 3,890 in 2015—Vox reported that this was the first increase in a century.India is home to the world's largest population of wild tigers|tiger
A 2014 census estimated a population of 2,226, a 30% increase since 2011|tiger
On International Tiger Day 2019, the 'Tiger Estimation Report 2018' was released by Prime Minister Narendra Modi|tiger
The report estimates a population of 2967 tigers in India with 25% increase since 2014|tiger
"Modi said ""India is one of the safest habitats for tigers as it has achieved the target of doubling the tiger population from 1411 in 2011 to 2967 in 2019"".In 1973, India's Project Tiger, started by Indira Gandhi, established numerous tiger reserves"|tiger
The project was credited with tripling the number of wild Bengal tigers from some 1,200 in 1973 to over 3,500 in the 1990s, but a 2007 census showed that numbers had dropped back to about 1,400 tigers because of poaching|tiger
Following the report, the Indian government pledged $153 million to the initiative, set up measures to combat poaching, promised funds to relocate up to 200,000 villagers in order to reduce human-tiger interactions, and set up eight new tiger reserves|tiger
India also reintroduced tigers to the Sariska Tiger Reserve and by 2009 it was claimed that poaching had been effectively countered at Ranthambore National Park.In the 1940s, the Siberian tiger was on the brink of extinction with only about 40 animals remaining in the wild in Russia|tiger
As a result, anti-poaching controls were put in place by the Soviet Union and a network of protected zones (zapovedniks) were instituted, leading to a rise in the population to several hundred|tiger
Poaching again became a problem in the 1990s, when the economy of Russia collapsed|tiger
The major obstacle in preserving the species is the enormous territory individual tigers require (up to 450 km2 needed by a single female and more for a single male)|tiger
Current conservation efforts are led by local governments and NGO's in concert with international organisations, such as the World Wide Fund for Nature and the Wildlife Conservation Society|tiger
The competitive exclusion of wolves by tigers has been used by Russian conservationists to convince hunters to tolerate the big cats|tiger
Tigers have less impact on ungulate populations than do wolves, and are effective in controlling the latter's numbers|tiger
In 2005, there were thought to be about 360 animals in Russia, though these exhibited little genetic diversity|tiger
However, in a decade later, the Siberian tiger census was estimated from 480 to 540 individuals.In China, tigers became the target of large-scale 'anti-pest' campaigns in the early 1950s, where suitable habitats were fragmented following deforestation and resettlement of people to rural areas, who hunted tigers and prey species|tiger
Though tiger hunting was prohibited in 1977, the population continued to decline and is considered extinct in southern China since 2001|tiger
Having earlier rejected the Western-led environmentalist movement, China changed its stance in the 1980s and became a party to the CITES treaty|tiger
By 1993 it had banned the trade in tiger parts, and this diminished the use of tiger bones in traditional Chinese medicine|tiger
The Tibetan people's trade in tiger skins has also been a threat to tigers|tiger
The pelts were used in clothing, tiger-skin chuba being worn as fashion|tiger
In 2006 the 14th Dalai Lama was persuaded to take up the issue|tiger
Since then there has been a change of attitude, with some Tibetans publicly burning their chubas.|tiger
In 1994, the Indonesian Sumatran Tiger Conservation Strategy addressed the potential crisis that tigers faced in Sumatra|tiger
The Sumatran Tiger Project (STP) was initiated in June 1995 in and around the Way Kambas National Park to ensure the long-term viability of wild Sumatran tigers and to accumulate data on tiger life-history characteristics vital for the management of wild populations|tiger
By August 1999, the teams of the STP had evaluated 52 sites of potential tiger habitat in Lampung Province, of which only 15 these were intact enough to contain tigers|tiger
In the framework of the STP a community-based conservation programme was initiated to document the tiger-human dimension in the park to enable conservation authorities to resolve tiger-human conflicts based on a comprehensive database rather than anecdotes and opinions.The Wildlife Conservation Society and Panthera Corporation formed the collaboration Tigers Forever, with field sites including the world's largest tiger reserve, the 21,756 km2 (8,400 sq mi) Hukaung Valley in Myanmar|tiger
Other reserves were in the Western Ghats in India, Thailand, Laos, Cambodia, the Russian Far East covering in total about 260,000 km2 (100,000 sq mi).Tigers have been studied in the wild using a variety of techniques|tiger
Tiger population have been estimated using plaster casts of their pugmarks, although this method was criticized as being inaccurate|tiger
More recent techniques include the use of camera traps and studies of DNA from tiger scat, while radio-collaring has been used to track tigers in the wild|tiger
Tiger spray has been found to be just as good, or better, as a source of DNA than scat.|tiger
The tiger has been one of the big five game animals of Asia|tiger
Tiger hunting took place on a large scale in the early 19th and 20th centuries, being a recognised and admired sport by the British in colonial India, the maharajas and aristocratic class of the erstwhile princely states of pre-independence India|tiger
A single maharaja or English hunter could claim to kill over a hundred tigers in their hunting career|tiger
Tiger hunting was done by some hunters on foot; others sat up on machans with a goat or buffalo tied out as bait; yet others on elephant-back.Historically, tigers have been hunted at a large scale so their famous striped skins could be collected|tiger
The trade in tiger skins peaked in the 1960s, just before international conservation efforts took effect|tiger
By 1977, a tiger skin in an English market was considered to be worth US$4,250.|tiger
Tiger parts are commonly used as amulets in South and Southeast Asia|tiger
In the Philippines, the fossils in Palawan were found besides stone tools|tiger
This, besides the evidence for cuts on the bones, and the use of fire, suggests that early humans had accumulated the bones, and the condition of the tiger subfossils, dated to approximately 12,000 to 9,000 years ago, differed from other fossils in the assemblage, dated to the Upper Paleolithic|tiger
The tiger subfossils showed longitudinal fracture of the cortical bone due to weathering, which suggests that they had post-mortem been exposed to light and air|tiger
Tiger canines were found in Ambangan sites dating to the 10th to 12th centuries in Butuan, Mindanao.Many people in China and other parts of Asia have a belief that various tiger parts have medicinal properties, including as pain killers and aphrodisiacs|tiger
There is no scientific evidence to support these beliefs|tiger
The use of tiger parts in pharmaceutical drugs in China is already banned, and the government has made some offences in connection with tiger poaching punishable by death|tiger
Furthermore, all trade in tiger parts is illegal under the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora and a domestic trade ban has been in place in China since 1993.However, the trading of tiger parts in Asia has become a major black market industry and governmental and conservation attempts to stop it have been ineffective to date|tiger
Almost all black marketers engaged in the trade are based in China and have either been shipped and sold within in their own country or into Taiwan, South Korea or Japan|tiger
The Chinese subspecies was almost completely decimated by killing for commerce due to both the parts and skin trades in the 1950s through the 1970s|tiger
Contributing to the illegal trade, there are a number of tiger farms in the country specialising in breeding them for profit|tiger
It is estimated that between 5,000 and 10,000 captive-bred, semi-tame animals live in these farms today|tiger
However, many tigers for traditional medicine black market are wild ones shot or snared by poachers and may be caught anywhere in the tiger's remaining range (from Siberia to India to the Malay Peninsula to Sumatra)|tiger
In the Asian black market, a tiger penis can be worth the equivalent of around $300 U.S|tiger
dollars|tiger
In the years of 1990 through 1992, 27 million products with tiger derivatives were found|tiger
In July 2014 at an international convention on endangered species in Geneva, Switzerland, a Chinese representative admitted for the first time his government was aware trading in tiger skins was occurring in China.|tiger
Wild tigers that have had no prior contact with humans actively avoid interactions with them|tiger
However, tigers cause more human deaths through direct attack than any other wild mammal|tiger
Attacks are occasionally provoked, as tigers lash out after being injured while they themselves are hunted|tiger
Attacks can be provoked accidentally, as when a human surprises a tiger or inadvertently comes between a mother and her young, or as in a case in rural India when a postman startled a tiger, used to seeing him on foot, by riding a bicycle|tiger
Occasionally tigers come to view people as prey|tiger
Such attacks are most common in areas where population growth, logging, and farming have put pressure on tiger habitats and reduced their wild prey|tiger
Most man-eating tigers are old, missing teeth, and unable to capture their preferred prey|tiger
For example, the Champawat Tiger, a tigress found in Nepal and then India, had two broken canines|tiger
She was responsible for an estimated 430 human deaths, the most attacks known to be perpetrated by a single wild animal, by the time she was shot in 1907 by Jim Corbett|tiger
According to Corbett, tiger attacks on humans are normally in daytime, when people are working outdoors and are not keeping watch|tiger
Early writings tend to describe man-eating tigers as cowardly because of their ambush tactics.Man-eaters have been a particular problem in recent decades in India and Bangladesh, especially in Kumaon, Garhwal and the Sundarbans mangrove swamps of Bengal, where some healthy tigers have hunted humans|tiger
Because of rapid habitat loss attributed to climate change, tiger attacks have increased in the Sundarbans|tiger
The Sundarbans area had 129 human deaths from tigers from 1969 to 1971|tiger
In the 10 years prior to that period, about 100 attacks per year in the Sundarbans, with a high of around 430 in some years of the 1960s|tiger
Unusually, in some years in the Sundarbans, more humans are killed by tigers than vice versa|tiger
In 1972, India's production of honey and beeswax dropped by 50% when at least 29 people who gathered these materials were devoured|tiger
In 1986 in the Sundarbans, since tigers almost always attack from the rear, masks with human faces were worn on the back of the head, on the theory that tigers usually do not attack if seen by their prey|tiger
This decreased the number of attacks only temporarily|tiger
All other means to prevent attacks, such as providing more prey or using electrified human dummies, did not work as well.|tiger
In Ancient Roman times, tigers were kept in menageries and amphitheatres to be exhibited, trained and paraded, and were often provoked to fight gladiators and other exotic beasts|tiger
Since the 17th century, tigers, being rare and ferocious, were sought after to keep at European castles as symbols of their owners' power|tiger
Tigers became central zoo and circus exhibits in the 18th century|tiger
a tiger could cost up to 4,000 francs in France (for comparison, a professor of the Beaux-Arts at Lyons earned only 3,000 francs a year), or up to $3,500 in the United States, where a lion cost no more than $1,000.In 2007, over 4,000 captive tigers lived in China, of which 3,000 were held by about 20 larger facilities, with the rest held by some 200 smaller facilities|tiger
In 2011, 468 facilities in the USA kept 2,884 tigers|tiger
Nineteen US states banned private ownership of tigers, fifteen require a license, and sixteen states have no regulation|tiger
Genetic ancestry of 105 captive tigers from fourteen countries and regions showed that forty-nine animals belonged distinctly to five subspecies; fifty-two animals had mixed subspecies origins|tiger
Many Siberian tigers in zoos today are actually the result of crosses with Bengal tigers.|tiger
Tigers and their superlative qualities have been a source of fascination for mankind since ancient times, and they are routinely visible as important cultural and media motifs|tiger
They are also considered one of the charismatic megafauna, and are used as the face of conservation campaigns worldwide|tiger
In a 2004 online poll conducted by cable television channel Animal Planet, involving more than 50,000 viewers from 73 countries, the tiger was voted the world's favourite animal with 21% of the vote, narrowly beating the dog.|tiger
In Chinese myth and culture, the tiger is one of the 12 animals of the Chinese zodiac|tiger
In Chinese art, the tiger is depicted as an earth symbol and equal rival of the Chinese dragon – the two representing matter and spirit respectively|tiger
The Southern Chinese martial art Hung Ga is based on the movements of the tiger and the crane|tiger
In Imperial China, a tiger was the personification of war and often represented the highest army general (or present day defense secretary), while the emperor and empress were represented by a dragon and phoenix, respectively|tiger
The White Tiger (Chinese|tiger
白虎; pinyin|tiger
Bái Hǔ) is one of the Four Symbols of the Chinese constellations|tiger
It is sometimes called the White Tiger of the West (Chinese|tiger
西方白虎), and it represents the west and the autumn season.The tiger's tail appears in stories from countries including China and Korea, it being generally inadvisable to grasp a tiger by the tail|tiger
In Korean myth and culture, the tiger is regarded as a guardian that drives away evil spirits and a sacred creature that brings good luck – the symbol of courage and absolute power|tiger
For the people who live in and around the forests of Korea, the tiger considered the symbol of the Mountain Spirit or King of mountain animals|tiger
"So, Koreans also called the tigers ""San Gun"" (산군) means Mountain Lord.In Buddhism, the tiger is one of the Three Senseless Creatures, symbolising anger, with the monkey representing greed and the deer lovesickness"|tiger
"The Tungusic peoples considered the Siberian tiger a near-deity and often referred to it as ""Grandfather"" or ""Old man"""|tiger
"The Udege and Nanai called it ""Amba"""|tiger
"The Manchu considered the Siberian tiger as ""Hu Lin,"" the king"|tiger
In Hinduism, the god Shiva wears and sits on tiger skin|tiger
The ten-armed warrior goddess Durga rides the tigress (or lioness) Damon into battle|tiger
In southern India the god Ayyappan was associated with a tiger|tiger
The weretiger replaces the werewolf in shapeshifting folklore in Asia; in India they were evil sorcerers, while in Indonesia and Malaysia they were somewhat more benign|tiger
In Greco-Roman tradition, the tiger was depicted being ridden by the god Dionysus.|tiger
In the Hindu epic Mahabharata, the tiger is fiercer and more ruthless than the lion|tiger
"In William Blake's poem in his Songs of Experience (1794), titled ""The Tyger"", the tiger is a menacing and fearful animal"|tiger
In Yann Martel's 2001 Man Booker Prize winning novel Life of Pi, the protagonist, surviving shipwreck for months in a small boat, somehow avoids being eaten by the other survivor, a large Bengal tiger|tiger
The story was adapted in Ang Lee's 2012 feature film of the same name|tiger
Jim Corbett's 1944 Man-Eaters of Kumaon tells ten true stories of his tiger-hunting exploits in what is now the northern Uttarakhand region of India|tiger
The book has sold over four million copies, and has been the basis of both fictional and documentary films|tiger
In Rudyard Kipling's 1894 The Jungle Book, the tiger, Shere Khan, is the mortal enemy of the human protagonist, Mowgli|tiger
More benign tiger characters include Tigger in A|tiger

"Tony the Tiger is a famous mascot for Kellogg's breakfast cereal Frosted Flakes, known for its catchphrase ""They're Gr-r-reat!"""|tiger
The Esso (Exxon) brand of petrol was advertised from 1959 onwards with the slogan 'put a tiger in your tank', and a tiger mascot; more than 2.5 million synthetic tiger tails were sold to motorists, who tied them to their petrol tank caps.|tiger
The tiger is one of the animals displayed on the Pashupati seal of the Indus Valley Civilisation|tiger
The tiger was the emblem of the Chola Dynasty and was depicted on coins, seals and banners|tiger
The seals of several Chola copper coins show the tiger, the Pandyan emblem fish and the Chera emblem bow, indicating that the Cholas had achieved political supremacy over the latter two dynasties|tiger
Gold coins found in Kavilayadavalli in the Nellore district of Andhra Pradesh have motifs of the tiger, bow and some indistinct marks|tiger
The tiger symbol of Chola Empire was later adopted by the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam and the tiger became a symbol of the unrecognised state of Tamil Eelam and Tamil independence movement|tiger
The Bengal tiger is the national animal of India and Bangladesh|tiger
The Malaysian tiger is the national animal of Malaysia|tiger
The Siberian tiger is the national animal of South Korea.|tiger
The tyger, a depiction of tigers as they were understood by European artists, is among the creatures used in charges and supporters in European heraldry|tiger
This creature has several notable differences from real tigers, including absent stripes, a leonine tufted tail, and a head terminating in large, pointed jaws|tiger
A more realistic version of the tiger entered the heraldic armory through the British Empire's expansion into Asia, and is referred to as the Bengal tiger to distinguish it from its older counterpart|tiger
The Bengal tiger is not a very common creature in heraldry, but is present as a supporter in the arms of Bombay and emblazoned on the shield of the University of Madras.|tiger

Rabbits, also known as bunnies or bunny rabbits, are small mammals in the family Leporidae (along with the hare) of the order Lagomorpha (along with the pika)|rabbit
Oryctolagus cuniculus includes the European rabbit species and its descendants, the world's 305 breeds of domestic rabbit|rabbit
Sylvilagus includes 13 wild rabbit species, among them the seven types of cottontail|rabbit
The European rabbit, which has been introduced on every continent except Antarctica, is familiar throughout the world as a wild prey animal and as a domesticated form of livestock and pet|rabbit
With its widespread effect on ecologies and cultures, the rabbit is, in many areas of the world, a part of daily life—as food, clothing, a companion, and a source of artistic inspiration.|rabbit
Male rabbits are called bucks; females are called does|rabbit
An older term for an adult rabbit used until the 18th century is coney (derived ultimately from the Latin cuniculus), while rabbit once referred only to the young animals|rabbit
Another term for a young rabbit is bunny, though this term is often applied informally (particularly by children) to rabbits generally, especially domestic ones|rabbit
More recently, the term kit or kitten has been used to refer to a young rabbit.|rabbit
A group of rabbits is known as a colony or nest (or, occasionally, a warren, though this more commonly refers to where the rabbits live)|rabbit
A group of baby rabbits produced from a single mating is referred to as a litter and a group of domestic rabbits living together is sometimes called a herd.The word rabbit itself derives from the Middle English rabet, a borrowing from the Walloon robète, which was a diminutive of the French or Middle Dutch robbe.|rabbit
Rabbits and hares were formerly classified in the order Rodentia (rodent) until 1912, when they were moved into a new order, Lagomorpha (which also includes pikas)|rabbit
Below are some of the genera and species of the rabbit.|rabbit
Hares are precocial, born relatively mature and mobile with hair and good vision, while rabbits are altricial, born hairless and blind, and requiring closer care|rabbit
Hares (and cottontail rabbits) live a relatively solitary life in a simple nest above the ground, while most rabbits live in social groups in burrows or warrens|rabbit
Hares are generally larger than rabbits, with ears that are more elongated, and with hind legs that are larger and longer|rabbit
Hares have not been domesticated, while descendants of the European rabbit are commonly bred as livestock and kept as pets.|rabbit
Rabbits have long been domesticated|rabbit
Beginning in the Middle Ages, the European rabbit has been widely kept as livestock, starting in ancient Rome|rabbit
Selective breeding has generated a wide variety of rabbit breeds, of which many (since the early 19th century) are also kept as pets|rabbit
Some strains of rabbit have been bred specifically as research subjects.|rabbit
As livestock, rabbits are bred for their meat and fur|rabbit
The earliest breeds were important sources of meat, and so became larger than wild rabbits, but domestic rabbits in modern times range in size from dwarf to giant|rabbit
Rabbit fur, prized for its softness, can be found in a broad range of coat colors and patterns, as well as lengths|rabbit
The Angora rabbit breed, for example, was developed for its long, silky fur, which is often hand-spun into yarn|rabbit
Other domestic rabbit breeds have been developed primarily for the commercial fur trade, including the Rex, which has a short plush coat.|rabbit
Because the rabbit's epiglottis is engaged over the soft palate except when swallowing, the rabbit is an obligate nasal breather|rabbit
Rabbits have two sets of incisor teeth, one behind the other|rabbit
This way they can be distinguished from rodents, with which they are often confused|rabbit
Carl Linnaeus originally grouped rabbits and rodents under the class Glires; later, they were separated as the scientific consensus is that many of their similarities were a result of convergent evolution|rabbit
However, recent DNA analysis and the discovery of a common ancestor has supported the view that they do share a common lineage, and thus rabbits and rodents are now often referred to together as members of the superorder Glires.|rabbit
Since speed and agility are a rabbit's main defenses against predators (including the swift fox), rabbits have large hind leg bones and well developed musculature|rabbit
Though plantigrade at rest, rabbits are on their toes while running, assuming a more digitigrade posture|rabbit
Rabbits use their strong claws for digging and (along with their teeth) for defense|rabbit
Each front foot has four toes plus a dewclaw|rabbit
Each hind foot has four toes (but no dewclaw).|rabbit
Most wild rabbits (especially compared to hares) have relatively full, egg-shaped bodies|rabbit
The soft coat of the wild rabbit is agouti in coloration (or, rarely, melanistic), which aids in camouflage|rabbit
The tail of the rabbit (with the exception of the cottontail species) is dark on top and white below|rabbit
Cottontails have white on the top of their tails.As a result of the position of the eyes in its skull, the rabbit has a field of vision that encompasses nearly 360 degrees, with just a small blind spot at the bridge of the nose.|rabbit
The anatomy of rabbits' hind limbs are structurally similar to that of other land mammals and contribute to their specialized form of locomotion|rabbit
The bones of the hind limbs consist of long bones (the femur, tibia, fibula, and phalanges) as well as short bones (the tarsals)|rabbit
These bones are created through endochondral ossification during development|rabbit
Like most land mammals, the round head of the femur articulates with the acetabulum of the ox coxae|rabbit
The femur articulates with the tibia, but not the fibula, which is fused to the tibia|rabbit
The tibia and fibula articulate with the tarsals of the pes, commonly called the foot|rabbit
The hind limbs of the rabbit are longer than the front limbs|rabbit
This allows them to produce their hopping form of locomotion|rabbit
Longer hind limbs are more capable of producing faster speeds|rabbit
Hares, which have longer legs than cottontail rabbits, are able to move considerably faster|rabbit
Rabbits stay just on their toes when moving; this is called Digitigrade locomotion|rabbit
The hind feet have four long toes that allow for this and are webbed to prevent them from spreading when hopping|rabbit
Rabbits do not have paw pads on their feet like most other animals that use digitigrade locomotion|rabbit
Instead, they have coarse compressed hair that offers protection.|rabbit
Rabbits have muscled hind legs that allow for maximum force, maneuverability, and acceleration that is divided into three main parts; foot, thigh, and leg|rabbit
The hind limbs of a rabbit are an exaggerated feature|rabbit
They are much longer than the forelimbs, providing more force|rabbit
Rabbits run on their toes to gain the optimal stride during locomotion|rabbit
The force put out by the hind limbs is contributed to both the structural anatomy of the fusion tibia and fibula, and muscular features|rabbit
Bone formation and removal, from a cellular standpoint, is directly correlated to hind limb muscles|rabbit
Action pressure from muscles creates force that is then distributed through the skeletal structures|rabbit
Rabbits that generate less force, putting less stress on bones are more prone to osteoporosis due to bone rarefaction|rabbit
In rabbits, the more fibers in a muscle, the more resistant to fatigue|rabbit
For example, hares have a greater resistance to fatigue than cottontails|rabbit
The muscles of rabbit's hind limbs can be classified into four main categories|rabbit
hamstrings, quadriceps, dorsiflexors, or plantar flexors|rabbit
The quadriceps muscles are in charge of force production when jumping|rabbit
Complementing these muscles are the hamstrings, which aid in short bursts of action|rabbit
These muscles play off of one another in the same way as the plantar flexors and dorsiflexors, contributing to the generation and actions associated with force.|rabbit
Within the order lagomorphs, the ears are utilized to detect and avoid predators|rabbit
In the family Leporidae, the ears are typically longer than they are wide|rabbit
For example, in black tailed jack rabbits, their long ears cover a greater surface area relative to their body size that allow them to detect predators from far away|rabbit
Contrasted to cotton tailed rabbits, their ears are smaller and shorter, requiring predators to be closer to detect them before they can flee|rabbit
Evolution has favored rabbits having shorter ears so the larger surface area does not cause them to lose heat in more temperate regions|rabbit
The opposite can be seen in rabbits that live in hotter climates, mainly because they possess longer ears that have a larger surface area that help with dispersion of heat as well as the theory that sound does not travel well in more arid air, opposed to cooler air|rabbit
Therefore, longer ears are meant to aid the organism in detecting predators sooner rather than later in warmer temperatures|rabbit
The rabbit is characterized by its shorter ears while hares are characterized by their longer ears|rabbit
Rabbits' ears are an important structure to aid thermoregulation and detect predators due to how the outer, middle, and inner ear muscles coordinate with one another|rabbit
The ear muscles also aid in maintaining balance and movement when fleeing predators.|rabbit
The auricle, also known as the pinna, is a rabbit's outer ear|rabbit
The rabbit's pinnae represent a fair part of the body surface area|rabbit
It is theorized that the ears aid in dispersion of heat at temperatures above 30 °C with rabbits in warmer climates having longer pinnae due to this|rabbit
Another theory is that the ears function as shock absorbers that could aid and stabilize rabbit's vision when fleeing predators, but this has typically only been seen in hares|rabbit
The rest of the outer ear has bent canals that lead to the eardrum or tympanic membrane.Middle ear|rabbit
The middle ear is filled with three bones called ossicles and is separated by the outer eardrum in the back of the rabbit's skull|rabbit
The three ossicles are called hammer, anvil, and stirrup and act to decrease sound before it hits the inner ear|rabbit
In general, the ossicles act as a barrier to the inner ear for sound energy.Inner ear|rabbit
Inner ear fluid called endolymph receives the sound energy|rabbit
After receiving the energy, later within the inner ear there are two parts|rabbit
the cochlea that  utilizes sound waves from the ossicles and the vestibular apparatus that manages the rabbit's position in regards to movement|rabbit
Within the cochlea there is a basilar membrane that contains sensory hair structures utilized to send nerve signals to the brain so it can recognize different sound frequencies|rabbit
Within the vestibular apparatus the rabbit possesses three semicircular canals to help detect angular motion.|rabbit
Thermoregulation is the process that an organism utilizes to maintain an optimal body temperature independent of external conditions|rabbit
This process is carried out by the pinnae, which takes up most of the rabbit's body surface and contain a vascular network and arteriovenous shunts|rabbit
In a rabbit, the optimal body temperature is around 38.5–40℃|rabbit
If their body temperature exceeds or does not meet this optimal temperature, the rabbit must return to homeostasis|rabbit
Homeostasis of body temperature is maintained by the use of their large, highly vascularized ears that are able to change the amount of blood flow that passes through the ears|rabbit
Constriction and dilation of blood vessels in the ears are used to control the core body temperature of a rabbit|rabbit
If the core temperature exceeds its optimal temperature greatly, blood flow is constricted to limit the amount of blood going through the vessels|rabbit
With this constriction, there is only a limited amount of blood that is passing through the ears where ambient heat would be able to heat the blood that is flowing through the ears and therefore, increasing the body temperature|rabbit
Constriction is also used when the ambient temperature is much lower than that of the rabbit's core body temperature|rabbit
When the ears are constricted it again limits blood flow through the ears to conserve the optimal body temperature of the rabbit|rabbit
If the ambient temperature is either 15 degrees above or below the optimal body temperature, the blood vessels will dilate|rabbit
With the blood vessels being enlarged, the blood is able to pass through the large surface area, causing it to either heat or cool down.|rabbit
During hot summers, the rabbit has the capability to stretch its pinnae, which allows for greater surface area and increase heat dissipation|rabbit
In cold winters, the rabbit does the opposite and folds its ears in order to decrease its surface area to the ambient air, which would decrease their body temperature.|rabbit
The jackrabbit has the largest ears within the Oryctolagus cuniculus group|rabbit
Their ears contribute to 17% of their total body surface area|rabbit
Their large pinna were evolved to maintain homeostasis while in the extreme temperatures of the desert.|rabbit
The rabbit's nasal cavity lies dorsal to the oral cavity, and the two compartments are separated by the hard and soft palate|rabbit
The nasal cavity itself is separated into a left and right side by a cartilage barrier, and it is covered in fine hairs that trap dust before it can enter the respiratory tract|rabbit
As the rabbit breathes, air flows in through the nostrils along the alar folds|rabbit
From there, the air moves into the nasal cavity, also known as the nasopharynx, down through the trachea, through the larynx, and into the lungs|rabbit
The larynx functions as the rabbit's voice box, which enables it to produce a wide variety of sounds|rabbit
The trachea is a long tube embedded with cartilaginous rings that prevent the tube from collapsing as air moves in and out of the lungs|rabbit
The trachea then splits into a left and right bronchus, which meet the lungs at a structure called the hilum|rabbit
From there, the bronchi split into progressively more narrow and numerous branches|rabbit
The bronchi branch into bronchioles, into respiratory bronchioles, and ultimately terminate at the alveolar ducts|rabbit
The branching that is typically found in rabbit lungs is a clear example of monopodial branching, in which smaller branches divide out laterally from a larger central branch.The structure of the rabbit's nasal and oral cavities, necessitates breathing through the nose|rabbit
This is due to the fact that the epiglottis is fixed to the backmost portion of the soft palate|rabbit
Within the oral cavity, a layer of tissue sits over the opening of the glottis, which blocks airflow from the oral cavity to the trachea|rabbit
The epiglottis functions to prevent the rabbit from aspirating on its food|rabbit
Further, the presence of a soft and hard palate allow the rabbit to breathe through its nose while it feeds.|rabbit
Rabbits lungs are divided into four lobes|rabbit
the cranial, middle, caudal, and accessory lobes|rabbit
The right lung is made up of all four lobes, while the left lung only has two|rabbit
the cranial and caudal lobes|rabbit
In order to provide space for the heart, the left cranial lobe of the lungs is significantly smaller than that of the right|rabbit
The diaphragm is a muscular structure that lies caudal to the lungs and contracts to facilitate respiration.|rabbit
Rabbits are herbivores that feed by grazing on grass and other leafy plants|rabbit
In consequence, their diet contains large amounts of cellulose, which is hard to digest|rabbit
Rabbits solve this problem via a form of hindgut fermentation|rabbit
They pass two distinct types of feces|rabbit
"hard droppings and soft black viscous pellets, the latter of which are known as caecotrophs or ""night droppings""  and are immediately eaten (a behaviour known as coprophagy)"|rabbit
Rabbits reingest their own droppings (rather than chewing the cud as do cows and numerous other herbivores) to digest their food further and extract sufficient nutrients.Rabbits graze heavily and rapidly for roughly the first half-hour of a grazing period (usually in the late afternoon), followed by about half an hour of more selective feeding|rabbit
In this time, the rabbit will also excrete many hard fecal pellets, being waste pellets that will not be reingested|rabbit
If the environment is relatively non-threatening, the rabbit will remain outdoors for many hours, grazing at intervals|rabbit
While out of the burrow, the rabbit will occasionally reingest its soft, partially digested pellets; this is rarely observed, since the pellets are reingested as they are produced.|rabbit
Hard pellets are made up of hay-like fragments of plant cuticle and stalk, being the final waste product after redigestion of soft pellets|rabbit
These are only released outside the burrow and are not reingested|rabbit
Soft pellets are usually produced several hours after grazing, after the hard pellets have all been excreted|rabbit
They are made up of micro-organisms and undigested plant cell walls.Rabbits are hindgut digesters|rabbit
This means that most of their digestion takes place in their large intestine and cecum|rabbit
In rabbits, the cecum is about 10 times bigger than the stomach and it along with the large intestine makes up roughly 40% of the rabbit's digestive tract|rabbit
The unique musculature of the cecum allows the intestinal tract of the rabbit to separate fibrous material from more digestible material; the fibrous material is passed as feces, while the more nutritious material is encased in a mucous lining as a cecotrope|rabbit
"Cecotropes, sometimes called ""night feces"", are high in minerals, vitamins and proteins that are necessary to the rabbit's health"|rabbit
Rabbits eat these to meet their nutritional requirements; the mucous coating allows the nutrients to pass through the acidic stomach for digestion in the intestines|rabbit
This process allows rabbits to extract the necessary nutrients from their food.The chewed plant material collects in the large cecum, a secondary chamber between the large and small intestine containing large quantities of symbiotic bacteria that help with the digestion of cellulose and also produce certain B vitamins|rabbit
The pellets are about 56% bacteria by dry weight, largely accounting for the pellets being 24.4% protein on average|rabbit
The soft feces form here and contain up to five times the vitamins of hard feces|rabbit
After being excreted, they are eaten whole by the rabbit and redigested in a special part of the stomach|rabbit
The pellets remain intact for up to six hours in the stomach; the bacteria within continue to digest the plant carbohydrates|rabbit
This double-digestion process enables rabbits to use nutrients that they may have missed during the first passage through the gut, as well as the nutrients formed by the microbial activity and thus ensures that maximum nutrition is derived from the food they eat|rabbit
This process serves the same purpose in the rabbit as rumination does in cattle and sheep.|rabbit
The adult male reproductive system forms the same as most mammals with the seminiferous tubular compartment containing the Sertoli cells and an adluminal compartment that contains the Leydig cells|rabbit
The Leydig cells produce testosterone, which maintains libido and creates secondary sex characteristics such as the genital tubercle and penis|rabbit
The Sertoli cells triggers the production of Anti-Müllerian duct hormone, which absorbs the Müllerian duct|rabbit
In an adult male rabbit, the sheath of the penis is cylinder-like and can be extruded as early as two months of age|rabbit
The scrotal sacs lay lateral to the penis and contain epididymal fat pads which protect the testes|rabbit
Between 10 and 14 weeks, the testes descend and are able to retract into the pelvic cavity in order to thermoregulate|rabbit
Furthermore, the secondary sex characteristics, such as the testes, are complex and secrete many compounds|rabbit
These compounds includes fructose, citric acid, minerals, and a uniquely high amount of catalase.|rabbit
The adult female reproductive tract is bipartite, which prevents an embryo from translocating between uteri|rabbit
The two uterine horns communicate to two cervixes and forms one vaginal canal|rabbit
Along with being bipartite, the female rabbit does not go through an estrus cycle, which causes mating induced ovulation.The average female rabbit becomes sexually mature at 3 to 8 months of age and can conceive at any time of the year for the duration of her life|rabbit
However, egg and sperm production can begin to decline after three years|rabbit
During mating, the male rabbit will mount the female rabbit from behind and insert his penis into the female and make rapid pelvic hip thrusts|rabbit
The encounter lasts only 20–40 seconds and after, the male will throw himself backwards off the female.The rabbit gestation period is short and ranges from 28 to 36 days with an average period of 31 days|rabbit
A longer gestation period will generally yield a smaller litter while shorter gestation periods will give birth to a larger litter|rabbit
The size of a single litter can range from four to 12 kits allowing a female to deliver up to 60 new kits a year|rabbit
After birth, the female can become pregnant again as early as the next dayThe mortality rates of embryos are high in rabbits and can be due to infection, trauma, poor nutrition and environmental stress so a high fertility rate is necessary to counter this.|rabbit
Rabbits may appear to be crepuscular, but their natural inclination is toward nocturnal activity|rabbit
In 2011, the average sleep time of a rabbit in captivity was calculated at 8.4 hours per day|rabbit
As with other prey animals, rabbits often sleep with their eyes open, so that sudden movements will awaken the rabbit to respond to potential danger.|rabbit
"In addition to being at risk of disease from common pathogens such as Bordetella bronchiseptica and Escherichia coli, rabbits can contract the virulent, species-specific viruses RHD (""rabbit hemorrhagic disease"", a form of calicivirus) or myxomatosis"|rabbit
Among the parasites that infect rabbits are tapeworms (such as Taenia serialis), external parasites (including fleas and mites), coccidia species, and Toxoplasma gondii|rabbit
Domesticated rabbits with a diet lacking in high fiber sources, such as hay and grass, are susceptible to potentially lethal gastrointestinal stasis|rabbit
Rabbits and hares are almost never found to be infected with rabies and have not been known to transmit rabies to humans.Encephalitozoon cuniculi, an obligate intracellular parasite is also capable of infecting many mammals including rabbits.|rabbit
Rabbits are prey animals and are therefore constantly aware of their surroundings|rabbit
For instance, in Mediterranean Europe, rabbits are the main prey of red foxes, badgers, and Iberian lynxes|rabbit
If confronted by a potential threat, a rabbit may freeze and observe then warn others in the warren with powerful thumps on the ground|rabbit
Rabbits have a remarkably wide field of vision, and a good deal of it is devoted to overhead scanning|rabbit
They survive predation by burrowing, hopping away in a zig-zag motion, and, if captured, delivering powerful kicks with their hind legs|rabbit
Their strong teeth allow them to eat and to bite in order to escape a struggle|rabbit
The longest-lived rabbit on record, a domesticated European rabbit living in Tasmania, died at age 18|rabbit
The lifespan of wild rabbits is much shorter; the average longevity of an eastern cottontail, for instance, is less than one year.|rabbit
Rabbit habitats include meadows, woods, forests, grasslands, deserts and wetlands|rabbit
Rabbits live in groups, and the best known species, the European rabbit, lives in burrows, or rabbit holes|rabbit
A group of burrows is called a warren.More than half the world's rabbit population resides in North America|rabbit
They are also native to southwestern Europe, Southeast Asia, Sumatra, some islands of Japan, and in parts of Africa and South America|rabbit
They are not naturally found in most of Eurasia, where a number of species of hares are present|rabbit
Rabbits first entered South America relatively recently, as part of the Great American Interchange|rabbit
Much of the continent has just one species of rabbit, the tapeti, while most of South America's southern cone is without rabbits.|rabbit
Rabbits have been a source of environmental problems when introduced into the wild by humans|rabbit
As a result of their appetites, and the rate at which they breed, feral rabbit depredation can be problematic for agriculture|rabbit
Gassing (fumigation of warrens), barriers (fences), shooting, snaring, and ferreting have been used to control rabbit populations, but the most effective measures are diseases such as myxomatosis (myxo or mixi, colloquially) and calicivirus|rabbit
In Europe, where rabbits are farmed on a large scale, they are protected against myxomatosis and calicivirus with a genetically modified virus|rabbit
The virus was developed in Spain, and is beneficial to rabbit farmers|rabbit
If it were to make its way into wild populations in areas such as Australia, it could create a population boom, as those diseases are the most serious threats to rabbit survival|rabbit
Rabbits in Australia and New Zealand are considered to be such a pest that land owners are legally obliged to control them.|rabbit
In some areas, wild rabbits and hares are hunted for their meat, a lean source of high quality protein|rabbit
In the wild, such hunting is accomplished with the aid of trained falcons, ferrets, or dogs, as well as with snares or other traps, and rifles|rabbit
A caught rabbit may be dispatched with a sharp blow to the back of its head, a practice from which the term rabbit punch is derived.|rabbit
Wild leporids comprise a small portion of global rabbit-meat consumption|rabbit
Domesticated descendants of the European rabbit (Oryctolagus cuniculus) that are bred and kept as livestock (a practice called cuniculture) account for the estimated 200 million tons of rabbit meat produced annually|rabbit
Approximately 1.2 billion rabbits are slaughtered each year for meat worldwide|rabbit
In 1994, the countries with the highest consumption per capita of rabbit meat were Malta with 8.89 kg (19 lb 10 oz), Italy with 5.71 kg (12 lb 9 oz), and Cyprus with 4.37 kg (9 lb 10 oz), falling to 0.03 kg (1 oz) in Japan|rabbit
The figure for the United States was 0.14 kg (5 oz) per capita|rabbit
The largest producers of rabbit meat in 1994 were China, Russia, Italy, France, and Spain|rabbit
Rabbit meat was once a common commodity in Sydney, Australia, but declined after the myxomatosis virus was intentionally introduced to control the exploding population of feral rabbits in the area.|rabbit
In the United Kingdom, fresh rabbit is sold in butcher shops and markets, and some supermarkets sell frozen rabbit meat|rabbit
At farmers markets there, including the famous Borough Market in London, rabbit carcasses are sometimes displayed hanging, unbutchered (in the traditional style), next to braces of pheasant or other small game|rabbit
"Rabbit meat is a feature of Moroccan cuisine, where it is cooked in a tajine with ""raisins and grilled almonds added a few minutes before serving"""|rabbit
In China, rabbit meat is particularly popular in Sichuan cuisine, with its stewed rabbit, spicy diced rabbit, BBQ-style rabbit, and even spicy rabbit heads, which have been compared to spicy duck neck|rabbit
Rabbit meat is comparatively unpopular elsewhere in the Asia-Pacific.|rabbit
An extremely rare infection associated with rabbits-as-food is tularemia (also known as rabbit fever), which may be contracted from an infected rabbit|rabbit
Hunters are at higher risk for tularemia because of the potential for inhaling the bacteria during the skinning process.|rabbit
In addition to their meat, rabbits are used for their wool, fur, and pelts, as well as their nitrogen-rich manure and their high-protein milk|rabbit
Production industries have developed domesticated rabbit breeds (such as the well-known Angora rabbit) to efficiently fill these needs.|rabbit
Rabbits are often used as a symbol of fertility or rebirth, and have long been associated with spring and Easter as the Easter Bunny|rabbit
The species' role as a prey animal with few defenses evokes vulnerability and innocence, and in folklore and modern children's stories, rabbits often appear as sympathetic characters, able to connect easily with youth of all kinds (for example, the Velveteen Rabbit, or Thumper in Bambi).|rabbit
With its reputation as a prolific breeder, the rabbit juxtaposes sexuality with innocence, as in the Playboy Bunny|rabbit
The rabbit (as a swift prey animal) is also known for its speed, agility, and endurance, symbolized (for example) by the marketing icons the Energizer Bunny and the Duracell Bunny.|rabbit
In Chinese folklore, rabbits accompany Chang'e on the Moon|rabbit
In the Chinese New Year, the zodiacal rabbit is one of the twelve celestial animals in the Chinese zodiac|rabbit
Note that the Vietnamese zodiac includes a zodiacal cat in place of the rabbit, possibly because rabbits did not inhabit Vietnam|rabbit
"The most common explanation, however, is that the ancient Vietnamese word for ""rabbit"" (mao) sounds like the Chinese word for ""cat"" (卯, mao)."|rabbit
In Japanese tradition, rabbits live on the Moon where they make mochi, the popular snack of mashed sticky rice|rabbit
This comes from interpreting the pattern of dark patches on the moon as a rabbit standing on tiptoes on the left pounding on an usu, a Japanese mortar.|rabbit
A Vietnamese mythological story portrays the rabbit of innocence and youthfulness|rabbit
The Gods of the myth are shown to be hunting and killing rabbits to show off their power.|rabbit
"Buddhism, Christianity, and Judaism have associations with an ancient circular motif called the three rabbits (or ""three hares"")"|rabbit
"Its meaning ranges from ""peace and tranquility"", to purity or the Holy Trinity, to Kabbalistic levels of the soul or to the Jewish diaspora"|rabbit
The tripartite symbol also appears in heraldry and even tattoos.The rabbit as trickster is a part of American popular culture, as Br'er Rabbit (from African-American folktales and, later, Disney animation) and Bugs Bunny (the cartoon character from Warner Bros.), for example.|rabbit
Anthropomorphized rabbits have appeared in film and literature, in Alice's Adventures in Wonderland (the White Rabbit and the March Hare characters), in Watership Down (including the film and television adaptations), in Rabbit Hill (by Robert Lawson), and in the Peter Rabbit stories (by Beatrix Potter)|rabbit
In the 1920s, Oswald the Lucky Rabbit, was a popular cartoon character.|rabbit
A rabbit's foot may be carried as an amulet, believed to bring protection and good luck|rabbit
This belief is found in many parts of the world, with the earliest use being recorded in Europe c|rabbit
600 BC.On the Isle of Portland in Dorset, UK, the rabbit is said to be unlucky and even speaking the creature's name can cause upset among older island residents|rabbit
This is thought to date back to early times in the local quarrying industry where (to save space) extracted stones that were not fit for sale were set aside in what became tall, unstable walls|rabbit
The local rabbits' tendency to burrow there would weaken the walls and their collapse resulted in injuries or even death|rabbit
Thus, invoking the name of the culprit became an unlucky act to be avoided|rabbit
In the local culture to this day, the rabbit (when he has to be referred to) may instead be called a “long ears” or “underground mutton”, so as not to risk bringing a downfall upon oneself|rabbit
"While it was true 50 years ago that a pub on the island could be emptied by calling out the word ""rabbit"", this has become more fable than fact in modern times.In other parts of Britain and in North America, invoking the rabbit's name may instead bring good luck"|rabbit
"""Rabbit rabbit rabbit"" is one variant of an apotropaic or talismanic superstition that involves saying or repeating the word ""rabbit"" (or ""rabbits"" or ""white rabbits"" or some combination thereof) out loud upon waking on the first day of each month, because doing so will ensure good fortune for the duration of that month."|rabbit
"The ""rabbit test"" is a term, first used in 1949, for the Friedman test, an early diagnostic tool for detecting a pregnancy in humans"|rabbit
It is a common misconception (or perhaps an urban legend) that the test-rabbit would die if the woman was pregnant|rabbit
"This led to the phrase ""the rabbit died"" becoming a euphemism for a positive pregnancy test."|rabbit

The Symbolism of Rabbits and Hares|rabbit
A dragon is a large, serpentine, legendary creature that appears in the folklore of many cultures worldwide|dragon
Beliefs about dragons vary considerably through regions, but dragons in western cultures since the High Middle Ages have often been depicted as winged, horned, four-legged, and capable of breathing fire|dragon
Dragons in eastern cultures are usually depicted as wingless, four-legged, serpentine creatures with above-average intelligence.|dragon
The earliest attested reports of draconic creatures resemble giant snakes|dragon
Draconic creatures are first described in the mythologies of the ancient Near East and appear in ancient Mesopotamian art and literature|dragon
Stories about storm-gods slaying giant serpents occur throughout nearly all Indo-European and Near Eastern mythologies|dragon
Famous prototypical draconic creatures include the mušḫuššu of ancient Mesopotamia; Apep in Egyptian mythology; Vṛtra in the Rigveda; the Leviathan in the Hebrew Bible; Grand'Goule in the Poitou region in France, Python, Ladon, Wyvern, and the Lernaean Hydra in Greek mythology; Jörmungandr, Níðhöggr, and Fafnir in Norse mythology; and the dragon from Beowulf.|dragon
The popular western image of a dragon is likely based on a conflation of earlier dragons from different traditions, and of inaccurate scribal drawings of snakes|dragon
In western cultures, dragons are portrayed as monsters to be tamed or overcome, usually by saints or culture heroes, as in the popular legend of Saint George and the Dragon|dragon
They are often said to have ravenous appetites and to live in caves, where they hoard treasure|dragon
These dragons appear frequently in western fantasy literature, including The Hobbit by J|dragon
R|dragon
R|dragon
Tolkien, the Harry Potter series by J|dragon
K|dragon
Rowling, and A Song of Ice and Fire by George R|dragon

"The word ""dragon"" has also come to be applied to the legendary creature in Chinese mythology, loong (traditional 龍, simplified 龙, Japanese simplified 竜, Pinyin lóng), which is associated with good fortune and is thought to have power over rain"|dragon
Dragons and their associations with rain are the source of the Chinese customs of dragon dancing and dragon boat racing|dragon
Many East Asian deities and demigods have dragons as their personal mounts or companions|dragon
Dragons were also identified with the Emperor of China, who, during later Chinese imperial history, was the only one permitted to have dragons on his house, clothing, or personal articles.|dragon
The impression of dragons in a large number of Asian countries has been influenced by Chinese culture, such as Korea, Vietnam, Japan and so on|dragon
"Chinese tradition has always used the dragon totem as the national emblem, and the ""Yellow Dragon flag"" of the Qing Dynasty has influenced the impression that China is a dragon in many European countries"|dragon
The white dragon of the flag of modern Bhutan is a very classic Chinese style dragon.Commonalities between dragons' traits are often a hybridization of feline, avian, and reptilian features, and may include|dragon
snakelike features, reptilian scaly skin, four legs with three or four toes on each, spinal nodes running down the back, a tail, and a serrated jaw with rows of teeth|dragon
Several modern scholars believe huge extinct or migrating crocodiles bear the closest resemblance, especially when encountered in forested or swampy areas, and are most likely the template of modern dragon imagery.|dragon
The word dragon entered the English language in the early 13th century from Old French dragon, which in turn comes from Latin|dragon
"draconem (nominative draco) meaning ""huge serpent, dragon"", from Ancient Greek δράκων, drákōn (genitive δράκοντος, drákontos) ""serpent, giant seafish"""|dragon
The Greek and Latin term referred to any great serpent, not necessarily mythological|dragon
"The Greek word δράκων is most likely derived from the Greek verb δέρκομαι (dérkomai) meaning ""I see"", the aorist form of which is ἔδρακον (édrakon)"|dragon
"This is thought to have referred to something with a ""deadly glance,"" or unusually bright or ""sharp"" eyes, or because a snake's eyes appear to be always open; each eye actually sees through a big transparent scale in its eyelids, which are permanently shut"|dragon
"The Greek word probably derives from an Indo-European base *derḱ- meaning ""to see""; the Sanskrit root दृश् (dr̥ś-) also means ""to see""."|dragon
Draconic creatures appear in virtually all cultures around the globe|dragon
Nonetheless, scholars dispute where the idea of a dragon originates from and a wide variety of hypotheses have been proposed.In his book An Instinct for Dragons (2000), anthropologist David E|dragon
Jones suggests a hypothesis that humans, like monkeys, have inherited instinctive reactions to snakes, large cats, and birds of prey|dragon
He cites a study which found that approximately 39 people in a hundred are afraid of snakes and notes that fear of snakes is especially prominent in children, even in areas where snakes are rare|dragon
The earliest attested dragons all resemble snakes or have snakelike attributes|dragon
Jones therefore concludes that dragons appear in nearly all cultures because humans have an innate fear of snakes and other animals that were major predators of humans' primate ancestors|dragon
"Dragons are usually said to reside in ""dank caves, deep pools, wild mountain reaches, sea bottoms, haunted forests"", all places which would have been fraught with danger for early human ancestors.In her book The First Fossil Hunters"|dragon
Dinosaurs, Mammoths, and Myth in Greek and Roman Times (2000), Adrienne Mayor argues that some stories of dragons may have been inspired by ancient discoveries of fossils belonging to dinosaurs and other prehistoric animals|dragon
"She argues that the dragon lore of northern India may have been inspired by ""observations of oversized, extraordinary bones in the fossilbeds of the Siwalik Hills below the Himalayas"" and that ancient Greek artistic depictions of the Monster of Troy may have been influenced by fossils of Samotherium, an extinct species of giraffe whose fossils are common in the Mediterranean region"|dragon
"In China, a region where fossils of large prehistoric animals are common, these remains are frequently identified as ""dragon bones"" and are commonly used in traditional Chinese medicine"|dragon
"Mayor, however, is careful to point out that not all stories of dragons and giants are inspired by fossils and notes that Scandinavia has many stories of dragons and sea monsters, but has long ""been considered barren of large fossils."" In one of her later books, she states that ""Many dragon images around the world were based on folk knowledge or exaggerations of living reptiles, such as Komodo dragons, Gila monsters, iguanas, alligators, or, in California, alligator lizards, though this still fails to account for the Scandinavian legends, as no such animals (historical or otherwise) have ever been found in this region.""Robert Blust in The Origin Of Dragons (2000) argues that, like many other creations of traditional cultures, dragons are largely explicable as products of a convergence of rational pre-scientific speculation about the world of real events"|dragon
In this case, the event is the natural mechanism governing rainfall and drought, with particular attention paid to the phenomenon of the rainbow.|dragon
In Egyptian mythology, Apep is a giant serpentine creature who resides in the Duat, the Egyptian Underworld|dragon
The Bremner-Rhind papyrus, written in around 310 BC, preserves an account of a much older Egyptian tradition that the setting of the sun is caused by Ra descending to the Duat to battle Apep|dragon
In some accounts, Apep is as long as the height of eight men with a head made of flint|dragon
Thunderstorms and earthquakes were thought to be caused by Apep's roar and solar eclipses were thought to be the result of Apep attacking Ra during the daytime|dragon
In some myths, Apep is slain by the god Set|dragon
Nehebkau is another giant serpent who guards the Duat and aided Ra in his battle against Apep|dragon
Nehebkau was so massive in some stories that the entire earth was believed to rest atop his coils|dragon
Denwen is a giant serpent mentioned in the Pyramid Texts whose body was made of fire and who ignited a conflagration that nearly destroyed all the gods of the Egyptian pantheon|dragon
He was ultimately defeated by the Pharaoh, a victory which affirmed the Pharaoh's divine right to rule.The ouroboros was a well-known Egyptian symbol of a serpent swallowing its own tail|dragon
"The precursor to the ouroboros was the ""Many-Faced"", a serpent with five heads, who, according to the Amduat, the oldest surviving Book of the Afterlife, was said to coil around the corpse of the sun god Ra protectively"|dragon
"The earliest surviving depiction of a ""true"" ouroboros comes from the gilded shrines in the tomb of Tutankhamun"|dragon
"In the early centuries AD, the ouroboros was adopted as a symbol by Gnostic Christians and chapter 136 of the Pistis Sophia, an early Gnostic text, describes ""a great dragon whose tail is in its mouth"""|dragon
In medieval alchemy, the ouroboros became a typical western dragon with wings, legs, and a tail|dragon
A famous image of the dragon gnawing on its tail from the eleventh-century Codex Marcianus was copied in numerous works on alchemy.|dragon
Archaeologist Zhōu Chong-Fa believes that the Chinese word for dragon is an onomatopoeia of the sound of thunder or lùhng in Cantonese.The Chinese dragon (simplified Chinese|dragon
龙; traditional Chinese|dragon
龍; pinyin|dragon
lóng) is the highest-ranking creature in the Chinese animal hierarchy|dragon
"Its origins are vague, but its ""ancestors can be found on Neolithic pottery as well as Bronze Age ritual vessels."" A number of popular stories deal with the rearing of dragons"|dragon
The Zuo zhuan, which was probably written during the Warring States period, describes a man named Dongfu, a descendant of Yangshu'an, who loved dragons and, because he could understand a dragon's will, he was able to tame them and raise them well|dragon
"He served Emperor Shun, who gave him the family name Huanlong, meaning ""dragon-raiser"""|dragon
In another story, Kongjia, the fourteenth emperor of the Xia dynasty, was given a male and a female dragon as a reward for his obedience to the god of heaven, but could not train them, so he hired a dragon-trainer named Liulei, who had learned how to train dragons from Huanlong|dragon
One day, the female dragon died unexpectedly, so Liulei secretly chopped her up, cooked her meat, and served it to the king, who loved it so much that he demanded Liulei to serve him the same meal again|dragon
Since Liulei had no means of procuring more dragon meat, he fled the palace.The image of the Chinese dragon was roughly established in the Shang and Zhou dynasties, but there was no great change for a long time|dragon
In the Han Dynasty, Yinglong, as a symbol of feudal imperial power, frequently appeared in Royal Dragon vessels, which means that most of the dragon image designs used by the royal family in the Han Dynasty are Yinglong patterns.Yinglong is a winged dragon in ancient Chinese legend|dragon
At present, the literature records of Yinglong's winged image can be tested from “Guangya（广雅）” during the Three Kingdoms period, but Yinglong's winged design has been found in bronze ware from the Shang and Zhou Dynasties to stone carvings, silk paintings and lacquerware of the Han Dynasty.The literature records of Yinglong can be traced back to the documents of the pre-Qin period, such as “Classic of Mountains and Seas”、“Chuci”and so on|dragon
According to the records in “Classic of Mountains and Seas”,the Chinese mythology in 2200 years ago, Ying long had the main characteristics of later Chinese dragons - the power to control the sky and the noble mythical status.However, since the Tang and Song Dynasties, the image of the real dragon symbolizing China's imperial power was no longer the Yinglong with wings, but the common wingless Yellow Dragon in modern times.For the evolution of Yinglong and Huanglong(Yellow Dragon）, Scholar Chen Zheng proposed in “Yinglong - the origin of the image of the real dragon” that from the middle of the Zhou Dynasty, Yinglong's wings gradually became the form of flame pattern and cloud pattern at the dragon's shoulder in artistic creation, which derived the wingeless long snake shape|dragon
The image of Huanglong was used together with the winged Yinglong|dragon
Since then, with a series of wars, Chinese civilization suffered heavy losses, resulting in the forgetting of the image of winged Yinglong, and the image of wingless Yellow Dragon replaced the original Yinglong and became the real dragon symbolizing China's imperial power.On this basis, scholars Xiao Congrong put forward that the simplified artistic creation of Ying Long's wings by Chinese ancestors is a continuous process, that is, the simplification of dragon's wings is an irreversible trend|dragon
"Xiao Congrong believes that the phenomenon of ""Yellow Dragon"" Replacing ""Ying Long"" can not be avoided regardless of whether Chinese civilization has suffered disaster or not.One of the most famous dragon stories is about the Lord Ye Gao, who loved dragons obsessively, even though he had never seen one"|dragon
He decorated his whole house with dragon motifs and, seeing this display of admiration, a real dragon came and visited Ye Gao, but the lord was so terrified at the sight of the creature that he ran away|dragon
In Chinese legend, the culture hero Fu Hsi is said to have been crossing the Lo River, when he saw the lung ma, a Chinese horse-dragon with seven dots on its face, six on its back, eight on its left flank, and nine on its right flank|dragon
He was so moved by this apparition that, when he arrived home, he drew a picture of it, including the dots|dragon
He later used these dots as letters and invented Chinese writing, which he used to write his book I Ching|dragon
In another Chinese legend, the physician Ma Shih Huang is said to have healed a sick dragon|dragon
Another legend reports that a man once came to the healer Lo Chên-jen, telling him that he was a dragon and that he needed to be healed|dragon
After Lo Chên-jen healed the man, a dragon appeared to him and carried him to heaven.In the Shanhaijing, a classic mythography probably compiled mostly during the Han dynasty, various deities and demigods are associated with dragons|dragon
"One of the most famous Chinese dragons is Ying Long (""responding dragon""), who helped the Huangdi, the Yellow Emperor, defeat the tyrant Chiyou"|dragon
"The dragon Zhulong (""torch dragon"") is a god ""who composed the universe with his body."" In the Shanhaijing, many mythic heroes are said to have been conceived after their mothers copulated with divine dragons, including Huangdi, Shennong, Emperor Yao, and Emperor Shun"|dragon
The god Zhurong and the emperor Qi are both described as being carried by two dragons, as are Huangdi, Zhuanxu, Yuqiang, and Roshou in various other texts|dragon
According to the Huainanzi, an evil black dragon once caused a destructive deluge, which was ended by the mother goddess Nüwa by slaying the dragon.|dragon
A large number of ethnic myths about dragons are told throughout China|dragon
The Houhanshu, compiled in the fifth century BC by Fan Ye, reports a story belonging to the Ailaoyi people, which holds that a woman named Shayi who lived in the region around Mount Lao became pregnant with ten sons after being touched by a tree trunk floating in the water while fishing|dragon
She gave birth to the sons and the tree trunk turned into a dragon, who asked to see his sons|dragon
"The woman showed them to him, but all of them ran away except for the youngest, who the dragon licked on the back and named Jiu Long, meaning ""sitting back"""|dragon
The sons later elected him king and the descendants of the ten sons became the Ailaoyi people, who tattooed dragons on their backs in honor of their ancestor|dragon
The Miao people of southwest China have a story that a divine dragon created the first humans by breathing on monkeys that came to play in his cave|dragon
The Han people have many stories about Short-Tailed Old Li, a black dragon who was born to a poor family in Shandong|dragon
When his mother saw him for the first time, she fainted and, when his father came home from the field and saw him, he hit him with a spade and cut off part of his tail|dragon
Li burst through the ceiling and flew away to the Black Dragon River in northeast China, where he became the god of that river|dragon
On the anniversary of his mother's death on the Chinese lunar calendar, Old Li returns home, causing it to rain|dragon
He is still worshipped as a rain god.|dragon
In China, dragons are closely associated with rain and drought is thought to be caused by a dragon's laziness|dragon
Prayers invoking dragons to bring rain are common in Chinese texts|dragon
The Luxuriant Dew of the Spring and Autumn Annals, attributed to the Han dynasty scholar Dong Zhongshu, prescribes making clay figurines of dragons during a time of drought and having young men and boys pace and dance among the figurines in order to encourage the dragons to bring rain|dragon
Texts from the Qing dynasty advise hurling the bone of a tiger or dirty objects into the pool where the dragon lives; since dragons cannot stand tigers or dirt, the dragon of the pool will cause heavy rain to drive the object out|dragon
Rainmaking rituals invoking dragons are still very common in many Chinese villages, where each village has its own god said to bring rain and many of these gods are dragons|dragon
Although stories of the Dragon Kings are among the most popular dragon stories in China today, these stories did not begin to emerge until the Eastern Han, when Buddhist stories of the serpent rain-god Nāga became popular|dragon
Taoists began to invent their own dragon kings and eventually such stories developed in every major Chinese religion|dragon
According to these stories, every body of water is ruled by a dragon king, each with a different power, rank, and ability, so people began establishing temples across the countryside dedicated to these figures.|dragon
Many traditional Chinese customs revolve around dragons|dragon
During various holidays, including the Spring Festival and Lantern Festival, villagers will construct an approximately sixteen-foot-long dragon from grass, cloth, bamboo strips, and paper, which they will parade through the city as part of a dragon dance|dragon
The original purpose of this ritual was to bring good weather and a strong harvest, but now it is done mostly only for entertainment|dragon
During the Duanwu festival, several villages, or even a whole province, will hold a dragon boat race, in which people race across a body of water in boats carved to look like dragons, while a large audience watches on the banks|dragon
The custom is traditionally said to have originated after the poet Qu Yuan committed suicide by drowning himself in the Miluo River and people raced out in boats hoping to save him, but most historians agree that the custom actually originated much earlier as a ritual to avert ill fortune|dragon
Starting during the Han dynasty and continuing until the Qing dynasty, the Chinese emperor gradually became closely identified with dragons, and emperors themselves claimed to be the incarnations of a divine dragon|dragon
Eventually, dragons were only allowed to appear on clothing, houses, and articles of everyday use belonging to the emperor and any commoner who possessed everyday items bearing the image of the dragon were ordered to be executed|dragon
After the last Chinese emperor was overthrown in 1911, this situation changed and now many ordinary Chinese people identify themselves as descendants of dragons.|dragon
The Korean dragon is in many ways similar in appearance to other East Asian dragons such as the Chinese and Japanese dragons|dragon
It differs from the Chinese dragon in that it developed a longer beard|dragon
Very occasionally a dragon may be depicted as carrying an orb known as the Yeouiju (여의주), the Korean name for the mythical Cintamani, in its claws or its mouth|dragon
It was said that whoever could wield the Yeouiju was blessed with the abilities of omnipotence and creation at will, and that only four-toed dragons (who had thumbs with which to hold the orbs) were both wise and powerful enough to wield these orbs, as opposed to the lesser, three-toed dragons|dragon
As with China, the number nine is significant and auspicious in Korea, and dragons were said to have 81 (9×9) scales on their backs, representing yang essence|dragon
Dragons in Korean mythology are primarily benevolent beings related to water and agriculture, often considered bringers of rain and clouds|dragon
Hence, many Korean dragons are said to have resided in rivers, lakes, oceans, or even deep mountain ponds|dragon
And human journeys to undersea realms, and especially the undersea palace of the Dragon King (용왕), are common in Korean folklore.In Korean myths, some kings who founded kingdoms were described as descendants of dragons because the dragon was a symbol of the monarch|dragon
Lady Aryeong, who was the first queen of Silla is said to have been born from a cockatrice, while the grandmother of Taejo of Goryeo, founder of Goryeo, was reportedly the daughter of the dragon king of the West Sea|dragon
And King Munmu of Silla, who on his deathbed wished to become a dragon of the East Sea in order to protect the kingdom|dragon
Dragon patterns were used exclusively by the royal family|dragon
The royal robe was also called the dragon robe (용포)|dragon
In Joseon Dynasty, the royal insignia, featuring embroidered dragons, were attached to the robe's shoulders, the chest, and back|dragon
The King wore five-taloned dragon insignia while the Crown Prince wore four-taloned dragon insignia.Korean folk mythology states that most dragons were originally Imugis (이무기), or lesser dragons, which were said to resemble gigantic serpents|dragon
There are a few different versions of Korean folklore that describe both what imugis are and how they aspire to become full-fledged dragons|dragon
Koreans thought that an Imugi could become a true dragon, yong or mireu, if it caught a Yeouiju which had fallen from heaven|dragon
Another explanation states they are hornless creatures resembling dragons who have been cursed and thus were unable to become dragons|dragon
By other accounts, an Imugi is a proto-dragon which must survive one thousand years in order to become a fully fledged dragon|dragon
In either case they are said to be large, benevolent, python-like creatures that live in water or caves, and their sighting is associated with good luck.|dragon
Japanese dragon myths amalgamate native legends with imported stories about dragons from China|dragon
Like those other Asian dragons, most Japanese ones are water deities associated with rainfall and bodies of water, and are typically depicted as large, wingless, serpentine creatures with clawed feet|dragon
"Gould writes (1896:248), the Japanese dragon is ""invariably figured as possessing three claws"""|dragon
A story about the samurai Minamoto no Mitsunaka tells that, while he was hunting in his own territory of Settsu, he fell asleep under a tree and had a dream in which a beautiful woman appeared to him and begged him to save her land from a giant serpent which was defiling it|dragon
Mitsunaka agreed to help and the maiden gave him a magnificent horse|dragon
When he woke up, the horse was standing before him|dragon
He rode it to the Sumiyoshi temple, where he prayed for eight days|dragon
Then he confronted the serpent and slew it with an arrow.It was believed that dragons could be appeased or exorcised with metal|dragon
Nitta Yoshisada is said to have hurled a famous sword into the sea at Sagami to appease the dragon-god of the sea and Ki no Tsurayuki threw a metal mirror into the sea at Sumiyoshi for the same purpose|dragon
Japanese Buddhism has also adapted dragons by subjecting them to Buddhist law; the Japanese Buddhist deities Benten and Kwannon are often shown sitting or standing on the back of a dragon|dragon
"Several Japanese sennin (""immortals"") have taken dragons as their mounts"|dragon
Bômô is said to have hurled his staff into a puddle of water, causing a dragon to come forth and let him ride it to heaven|dragon
The rakan Handaka is said to have been able to conjure a dragon out of a bowl, which he is often shown playing with on kagamibuta|dragon
The shachihoko is a creature with the head of a dragon, a bushy tail, fishlike scales, and sometimes fire emerging from its armpits|dragon
The shifun has the head of a dragon, feathered wings, and the tail and claws of a bird|dragon
"A white dragon was believed to reside in a pool in Yamashiro Province and, every fifty years, it would turn into a bird called the Ogonchô, which had a call like the ""howling of a wild dog"""|dragon
This event was believed to herald terrible famine|dragon
In the Japanese village of Okumura, near Edo, during times of drought, the villagers would make a dragon effigy out of straw, magnolia leaves, and bamboo and parade it through the village to attract rainfall.|dragon
The Vietnamese dragon (Vietnamese|dragon
rồng 龍) was a mythical creature that was often used as a deity symbol and associated with royalty|dragon
Similar to other cultures, dragons in Vietnamese culture represent yang and godly being associated with creation and life.|dragon
"Ancient peoples across the Near East believed in creatures similar to what modern people call ""dragons"""|dragon
These ancient peoples were unaware of the existence of dinosaurs or similar creatures in the distant past|dragon
References to dragons of both benevolent and malevolent characters occur throughout ancient Mesopotamian literature|dragon
In Sumerian poetry, great kings are often compared to the ušumgal, a gigantic, serpentine monster|dragon
A draconic creature with the foreparts of a lion and the hind-legs, tail, and wings of a bird appears in Mesopotamian artwork from the Akkadian Period (c|dragon
2334 – 2154 BC) until the Neo-Babylonian Period (626 BC–539 BC)|dragon
The dragon is usually shown with its mouth open|dragon
"It may have been known as the (ūmu) nā’iru, which means ""roaring weather beast"", and may have been associated with the god Ishkur (Hadad)"|dragon
A slightly different lion-dragon with two horns and the tail of a scorpion appears in art from the Neo-Assyrian Period (911 BC–609 BC)|dragon
A relief probably commissioned by Sennacherib shows the gods Ashur, Sin, and Adad standing on its back.Another draconic creature with horns, the body and neck of a snake, the forelegs of a lion, and the hind-legs of a bird appears in Mesopotamian art from the Akkadian Period until the Hellenistic Period (323 BC–31 BC)|dragon
"This creature, known in Akkadian as the mušḫuššu, meaning ""furious serpent"", was used as a symbol for particular deities and also as a general protective emblem"|dragon
It seems to have originally been the attendant of the Underworld god Ninazu, but later became the attendant to the Hurrian storm-god Tishpak, as well as, later, Ninazu's son Ningishzida, the Babylonian national god Marduk, the scribal god Nabu, and the Assyrian national god Ashur.Scholars disagree regarding the appearance of Tiamat, the Babylonian goddess personifying primeval chaos slain by Marduk in the Babylonian creation epic Enûma Eliš|dragon
"She was traditionally regarded by scholars as having had the form of a giant serpent, but several scholars have pointed out that this shape ""cannot be imputed to Tiamat with certainty"" and she seems to have at least sometimes been regarded as anthropomorphic"|dragon
Nonetheless, in some texts, she seems to be described with horns, a tail, and a hide that no weapon can penetrate, all features which suggest she was conceived as some form of dragoness.|dragon
"In the Ugaritic Baal Cycle, the sea-dragon Lōtanu is described as ""the twisting serpent/ the powerful one with seven heads."" In KTU 1.5 I 2–3, Lōtanu is slain by the storm-god Baal, but, in KTU 1.3 III 41–42, he is instead slain by the virgin warrior goddess Anat"|dragon
In the Book of Psalms, Psalm 74, Psalm 74:13–14, the sea-dragon Leviathan, whose name is a cognate of Lōtanu, is slain by Yahweh, the national god of the kingdoms of Israel and Judah, as part of the creation of the world|dragon
In Isaiah 27:1, Yahweh's destruction of Leviathan is foretold as part of Yahweh's impending overhaul of the universal order:|dragon
Job 41:1–34 contains a detailed description of the Leviathan, who is described as being so powerful that only Yahweh can overcome it|dragon
Job 41:19–21 states that the Leviathan exhales fire and smoke, making its identification as a mythical dragon clearly apparent|dragon
In some parts of the Old Testament, the Leviathan is historicized as a symbol for the nations that stand against Yahweh|dragon
"Rahab, a synonym for ""Leviathan"", is used in several Biblical passages in reference to Egypt"|dragon
Isaiah 30:7 declares|dragon
"""For Egypt's help is worthless and empty, therefore I have called her 'the silenced Rahab'."" Similarly, Psalm 87:3 reads"|dragon
"""I reckon Rahab and Babylon as those that know me..."" In Ezekiel 29:3–5 and Ezekiel 32:2–8, the pharaoh of Egypt is described as a ""dragon"" (tannîn)"|dragon
In the story of Bel and the Dragon from the apocryphal additions to Daniel, the prophet Daniel sees a dragon being worshipped by the Babylonians|dragon
"Daniel makes ""cakes of pitch, fat, and hair""; the dragon eats them and bursts open."|dragon
Azhi Dahaka (Avestan Great Snake) is a dragon or demonic figure in the texts and mythology of Zoroastrian Persia, where he is one of the subordinates of Angra Mainyu|dragon
Alternate names include Azi Dahak, Dahaka, Dahak|dragon
"Aži (nominative ažiš) is the Avestan word for ""serpent"" or ""dragon"|dragon
"The Avestan term Aži Dahāka and the Middle Persian azdahāg are the source of the Middle Persian Manichaean demon of greed ""Az"", Old Armenian mythological figure Aždahak, Modern Persian 'aždehâ/aždahâ', Tajik Persian 'azhdahâ', Urdu 'azhdahā' (اژدها), as well as the Kurdish ejdîha (ئەژدیها)."|dragon
Aži Dahāka is the most significant and long-lasting of the ažis of the Avesta, the earliest religious texts of Zoroastrianism|dragon
He is described as a monster with three mouths, six eyes, and three heads, cunning, strong, and demonic|dragon
In other respects Aži Dahāka has human qualities, and is never a mere animal|dragon
In a post-Avestan Zoroastrian text, the Dēnkard, Aži Dahāka is possessed of all possible sins and evil counsels, the opposite of the good king Jam (or Jamshid)|dragon
"The name Dahāg (Dahāka) is punningly interpreted as meaning ""having ten (dah) sins""."|dragon
In Ferdowsi's Shahnameh, the Iranian hero Rostam must slay an 80-meter-long dragon (which renders itself invisible to human sight) with the aid of his legendary horse, Rakhsh|dragon
As Rostam is sleeping, the dragon approaches; Rakhsh attempts to wake Rostam, but fails to alert him to the danger until Rostam sees the dragon|dragon
Rakhsh bites the dragon, while Rostam decapitates it|dragon
This is the third trial of Rostam's Seven Labors.Rostam is also credited with the slaughter of other dragons in the Shahnameh and in other Iranian oral traditions, notably in the myth of Babr-e-Bayan|dragon
"In this tale, Rostam is still an adolescent and kills a dragon in the ""Orient"" (either India or China depending on the source) by forcing it to swallow either ox hides filled with quicklime and stones or poisoned blades"|dragon
The dragon swallows these foreign objects and its stomach bursts, after which Rostam flays the dragon and fashions a coat from its hide called the babr-e bayān|dragon
In some variants of the story, Rostam then remains unconscious for two days and nights, but is guarded by his steed Rakhsh|dragon
On reviving, he washes himself in a spring|dragon
In the Mandean tradition of the story, Rostam hides in a box, is swallowed by the dragon and kills it from inside its belly|dragon
The king of China then gives Rostam his daughter in marriage as a reward.|dragon
In the Rigveda, the oldest of the four Vedas, Indra, the Vedic god of storms, battles Vṛtra, a giant serpent who represents drought|dragon
Indra kills Vṛtra using his vajra (thunderbolt) and clears the path for rain, which is described in the form of cattle|dragon
"""You won the cows, hero, you won the Soma,/You freed the seven streams to flow"" (Rigveda 1.32.12)"|dragon
In another Rigvedic legend, the three-headed serpent Viśvarūpa, the son of Tvaṣṭṛ, guards a wealth of cows and horses|dragon
Indra delivers Viśvarūpa to a god named Trita Āptya, who fights and kills him and sets his cattle free|dragon
Indra cuts off Viśvarūpa's heads and drives the cattle home for Trita|dragon
This same story is alluded to in the Younger Avesta, in which the hero Thraētaona, the son of Āthbya, slays the three-headed dragon Aži Dahāka and takes his two beautiful wives as spoils|dragon
"Thraētaona's name (meaning ""third grandson of the waters"") indicates that Aži Dahāka, like Vṛtra, was seen as a blocker of waters and cause of drought.The Druk (Dzongkha"|dragon
འབྲུག་), also known as 'Thunder Dragon', is one of the National symbols of Bhutan|dragon
"In the Dzongkha language, Bhutan is known as Druk Yul ""Land of Druk"", and Bhutanese leaders are called Druk Gyalpo, ""Thunder Dragon Kings"""|dragon
The druk was adopted as an emblem by the Drukpa Lineage, which originated in Tibet and later spread to Bhutan.|dragon
The story of a hero slaying a giant serpent occurs in nearly every Indo-European mythology|dragon
In most stories, the hero is some kind of thunder-god|dragon
"In nearly every iteration of the story, the serpent is either multi-headed or ""multiple"" in some other way"|dragon
Furthermore, in nearly every story, the serpent is always somehow associated with water|dragon
Bruce Lincoln has proposed that a Proto-Indo-European dragon-slaying myth can be reconstructed as follows|dragon
"First, the sky gods give cattle to a man named *Tritos (""the third""), who is so named because he is the third man on earth, but a three-headed serpent named *Ngwhi steals them"|dragon
"*Tritos pursues the serpent and is accompanied by *Hanér, whose name means ""man"""|dragon
Together, the two heroes slay the serpent and rescue the cattle.|dragon
"The ancient Greek word usually translated as ""dragon"" (δράκων drákōn, genitive δράκοντοϛ drákontos) could also mean ""snake"", but it usually refers to a kind of giant serpent that either possesses supernatural characteristics or is otherwise controlled by some supernatural power"|dragon
"The first mention of a ""dragon"" in ancient Greek literature occurs in the Iliad, in which Agamemnon is described as having a blue dragon motif on his sword belt and an emblem of a three-headed dragon on his breast plate"|dragon
In lines 820–880 of the Theogony, a Greek poem written in the seventh century BC by the Boeotian poet Hesiod, the Greek god Zeus battles the monster Typhon, who has one hundred serpent heads that breathe fire and make many frightening animal noises|dragon
Zeus scorches all of Typhon's heads with his lightning bolts and then hurls Typhon into Tartarus|dragon
In the Homeric Hymn to Apollo, the god Apollo uses his poisoned arrows to slay the serpent Python, who has been causing death and pestilence in the area around Delphi|dragon
"Apollo then sets up his shrine there.The Roman poet Virgil in his poem Culex, lines 163–201 [1], describing a shepherd having a fight with a big constricting snake, calls it ""serpens"" and also ""draco"", showing that in his time the two words were probably interchangeable."|dragon
Hesiod also mentions that the hero Heracles slew the Lernaean Hydra, a multiple-headed serpent which dwelt in the swamps of Lerna|dragon
"The name ""Hydra"" means ""water snake"" in Greek"|dragon
According to the Bibliotheka of Pseudo-Apollodorus, the slaying of the Hydra was the second of the Twelve Labors of Heracles|dragon
Accounts disagree on which weapon Heracles used to slay the Hydra, but, by the end of the sixth century BC, it was agreed that the clubbed or severed heads needed to be cauterized to prevent them from growing back|dragon
Heracles was aided in this task by his nephew Iolaus|dragon
During the battle, a giant crab crawled out of the marsh and pinched Heracles's foot, but he crushed it under his heel|dragon
Hera placed the crab in the sky as the constellation Cancer|dragon
One of the Hydra's heads was immortal, so Heracles buried it under a heavy rock after cutting it off|dragon
"For his Eleventh Labor, Heracles must procure a golden apple from the tree in the Garden of the Hesperides, which is guarded by an enormous serpent that never sleeps, which Pseudo-Apollodorus calls ""Ladon"""|dragon
In earlier depictions, Ladon is often shown with many heads|dragon
In Pseudo-Apollodorus's account, Ladon is immortal, but Sophocles and Euripides both describe Heracles as killing him, although neither of them specifies how|dragon
The mythographer Herodorus is the first to state that Heracles slew him using his famous club|dragon
"Apollonius of Rhodes, in his epic poem the Argonautica, describes Ladon as having been shot full of poisoned arrows dipped in the blood of the Hydra.In Pindar's Fourth Pythian Ode, Aeëtes of Colchis tells the hero Jason that the Golden Fleece he is seeking is in a copse guarded by a dragon, ""which surpassed in breadth and length a fifty-oared ship"""|dragon
Jason slays the dragon and makes off with the Golden Fleece together with his co-conspirator, Aeëtes's daughter, Medea|dragon
The earliest artistic representation of this story is an Attic red-figure kylix dated to c|dragon
480–470 BC, showing a bedraggled Jason being disgorged from the dragon's open mouth as the Golden Fleece hangs in a tree behind him and Athena, the goddess of wisdom, stands watching|dragon
A fragment from Pherecydes of Athens states that Jason killed the dragon, but fragments from the Naupactica and from Herodorus state that he merely stole the Fleece and escaped|dragon
In Euripides's Medea, Medea boasts that she killed the Colchian dragon herself|dragon
In the most famous retelling of the story from Apollonius of Rhodes's Argonautica, Medea drugs the dragon to sleep, allowing Jason to steal the Fleece|dragon
Greek vase paintings show her feeding the dragon the sleeping drug in a liquid form from a phialē, or shallow cup.|dragon
In the founding myth of Thebes, Cadmus, a Phoenician prince, was instructed by Apollo to follow a heifer and found a city wherever it laid down|dragon
Cadmus and his men followed the heifer and, when it laid down, Cadmus ordered his men to find a spring so he could sacrifice the heifer to Athena|dragon
His men found a spring, but it was guarded by a dragon, which had been placed there by the god Ares, and the dragon killed them|dragon
Cadmus killed the dragon in revenge, either by smashing its head with a rock or using his sword|dragon
Following the advice of Athena, Cadmus tore out the dragon's teeth and planted them in the earth|dragon
"An army of giant warriors (known as spartoi, which means ""sown men"") grew from the teeth like plants"|dragon
Cadmus hurled stones into their midst, causing them to kill each other until only five were left|dragon
To make restitution for having killed Ares's dragon, Cadmus was forced to serve Ares as a slave for eight years|dragon
At the end of this period, Cadmus married Harmonia, the daughter of Ares and Aphrodite|dragon
Cadmus and Harmonia moved to Illyria, where they ruled as king and queen, before eventually being transformed into dragons themselves.In the fifth century BC, the Greek historian Herodotus reported in Book IV of his Histories that western Libya was inhabited by monstrous serpents and, in Book III, he states that Arabia was home to many small, winged serpents, which came in a variety of colors and enjoyed the trees that produced frankincense|dragon
Herodotus remarks that the serpent's wings were like those of bats and that, unlike vipers, which are found in every land, winged serpents are only found in Arabia|dragon
The second-century BC Greek astronomer Hipparchus (c|dragon
190 BC – c|dragon
"120 BC) listed the constellation Draco (""the dragon"") as one of forty-six constellations"|dragon
Hipparchus described the constellation as containing fifteen stars, but the later astronomer Ptolemy (c|dragon
100 – c|dragon
170 AD) increased this number to thirty-one in his Almagest.|dragon
In the New Testament, Revelation 12:3, written by John of Patmos, describes a vision of a Great Red Dragon with seven heads, ten horns, seven crowns, and a massive tail, an image which is clearly inspired by the vision of the four beasts from the sea in the Book of Daniel and the Leviathan described in various Old Testament passages|dragon
"The Great Red Dragon knocks ""a third of the sun .."|dragon
"a third of the moon, and a third of the stars"" out the sky and pursues the Woman of the Apocalypse"|dragon
Revelation 12:7–9 declares|dragon
"""And war broke out in Heaven"|dragon
Michael and his angels fought against Dragon|dragon
Dragon and his angels fought back, but they were defeated, and there was no longer any place for them in Heaven|dragon
"Dragon the Great was thrown down, that ancient serpent who is called Devil and Satan, the one deceiving the whole inhabited World – he was thrown down to earth and his angels were thrown down with him."" Then a voice booms down from Heaven heralding the defeat of ""the Accuser"" (ho Kantegor).In 217 AD, Flavius Philostratus discussed dragons (δράκων, drákōn) in India in The Life of Apollonius of Tyana (II,17 and III,6–8)"|dragon
The Loeb Classical Library translation (by F.C|dragon
"Conybeare) mentions (III,7) that ""In most respects the tusks resemble the largest swine's, but they are slighter in build and twisted, and have a point as unabraded as sharks' teeth."" According to a collection of books by Claudius Aelianus called On Animals, Ethiopia was inhabited by a species of dragon that hunted elephants and could grow to a length of 180 feet (55 m) with a lifespan rivaling that of the most enduring of animals."|dragon
In the Old Norse poem Grímnismál in the Poetic Edda, the dragon Níðhöggr is described as gnawing on the roots of Yggdrasil, the world tree|dragon
In Norse mythology, Jörmungandr is a giant serpent that encircles the entire realm of Miðgarð in the sea around it|dragon
According to the Gylfaginning from the Prose Edda, written by the thirteenth-century Icelandic mythographer Snorri Sturluson, Thor, the Norse god of thunder, once went out on a boat with the giant Hymnir to the outer sea and fished for Jörmungandr using an ox-head as bait|dragon
Thor caught the serpent and, after pulling its head out of the water, smashed it with his hammer Mjölnir|dragon
Snorri states that the blow was not fatal|dragon
"""and men say that he struck its head off on the sea bed"|dragon
"But I think the truth to tell you is that the Miðgarð Serpent still lives and lies in the surrounding sea.""Towards the end of the Old English epic poem Beowulf, a slave steals a cup from the hoard of a sleeping dragon, causing the dragon to wake up and go on a rampage of destruction across the countryside"|dragon
The eponymous hero of the poem insists on confronting the dragon alone, even though he is of advanced age, but Wiglaf, the youngest of the twelve warriors Beowulf has brought with him, insists on accompanying his king into the battle|dragon
Beowulf's sword shatters during the fight and he is mortally wounded, but Wiglaf comes to his rescue and helps him slay the dragon|dragon
Beowulf dies and tells Wiglaf that the dragon's treasure must be buried rather than shared with the cowardly warriors who did not come to the aid of their king.In the Old Norse Völsunga saga, the hero Sigurd catches the dragon Fafnir by digging a pit between the cave where he lives and the spring where he drinks his water and kills him by stabbing him in the underside|dragon
At the advice of Odin, Sigurd drains Fafnir's blood and drinks it, which gives him the ability to understand the language of the birds, who he hears talking about how his mentor Regin is plotting to betray him so that he can keep all of Fafnir's treasure for himself|dragon
The motif of a hero trying to sneak past a sleeping dragon and steal some of its treasure is common throughout many Old Norse sagas|dragon
The fourteenth-century Flóres saga konungs ok sona hans describes a hero who is actively concerned not to wake a sleeping dragon while sneaking past it|dragon
In the Yngvars saga víðförla, the protagonist attempts to steal treasure from several sleeping dragons, but accidentally wakes them up.|dragon
The modern, western image of a dragon developed in western Europe during the Middle Ages through the combination of the snakelike dragons of classical Graeco-Roman literature, references to Near Eastern European dragons preserved in the Bible, and western European folk traditions|dragon
The period between the eleventh and thirteenth centuries represents the height of European interest in dragons as living creatures|dragon
The twelfth-century Welsh monk Geoffrey of Monmouth recounts a famous legend in his Historia Regum Britanniae in which the child prophet Merlin witnesses the Romano-Celtic warlord Vortigern attempt to build a tower on Mount Snowdon to keep safe from the Anglo-Saxons, but the tower keeps being swallowed into the ground|dragon
Merlin informs Vortigern that, underneath the foundation he has built, is a pool with two dragons sleeping in it|dragon
Vortigern orders for the pool to be drained, exposing a red dragon and a white dragon, who immediately begin fighting|dragon
Merlin delivers a prophecy that the white dragon will triumph over the red, symbolizing England's conquest of Wales, but declares that the red dragon will eventually return and defeat the white one|dragon
This story remained popular throughout the fifteenth century.|dragon
The oldest recognizable image of a fully modern, western dragon appears in a hand-painted illustration from the medieval manuscript MS Harley 3244, which was produced in around 1260 AD|dragon
The dragon in the illustration has two sets of wings and its tail is longer than most modern depictions of dragons, but it clearly displays many of the same distinctive features|dragon
Dragons are generally depicted as living in rivers or having an underground lair or cave|dragon
They are envisioned as greedy and gluttonous, with voracious appetites|dragon
"They are often identified with Satan, due to the references to Satan as a ""dragon"" in the Book of Revelation"|dragon
The thirteenth-century Golden Legend, written in Latin, records the story of Saint Margaret of Antioch, a virgin martyr who, after being tortured for her faith in the Diocletianic Persecution and thrown back into her cell, is said to have been confronted by a monstrous dragon, but she made the sign of the cross and the dragon vanished|dragon
In some versions of the story, she is actually swallowed by the dragon alive and, after making the sign of the cross in the dragon's stomach, emerges unharmed.|dragon
The legend of Saint George and the Dragon may be referenced as early as the sixth century AD, but the earliest artistic representations of it come from the eleventh century and the first full account of it comes from an eleventh-century Georgian text|dragon
The most famous version of the story from the Golden Legend holds that a dragon kept pillaging the sheep of the town of Silene in Libya|dragon
After it ate a young shepherd, the people were forced to placate it by leaving two sheep as sacrificial offerings every morning beside the lake where the dragon lived|dragon
Eventually, the dragon ate all of the sheep and the people were forced to start offering it their own children|dragon
One day, the king's own daughter came up in the lottery and, despite the king's pleas for her life, she was dressed as a bride and chained to a rock beside the lake to be eaten|dragon
Then, Saint George arrived and saw the princess|dragon
When the dragon arrived to eat her, he stabbed it with his lance and subdued it by making the sign of the cross and tying the princess's girdle around its neck|dragon
Saint George and the princess led the now-docile dragon into the town and George promised to kill it if the townspeople would convert to Christianity|dragon
All the townspeople converted and Saint George killed the dragon with his sword|dragon
In some versions, Saint George marries the princess, but, in others, he continues wandering.Gargoyles are carved stone figures sometimes resembling dragons that originally served as waterspouts on buildings|dragon
Precursors to the medieval gargoyle can be found on ancient Greek and Egyptian temples, but, over the course of the Middle Ages, many fantastic stories were invented to explain them|dragon
One medieval French legend holds that, in ancient times, a fearsome dragon known as La Gargouille had been causing floods and sinking ships on the river Seine, so the people of the town of Rouen would offer the dragon a human sacrifice once each year to appease its hunger|dragon
Then, in around 600 AD, a priest named Romanus promised that, if the people would build a church, he would rid them of the dragon|dragon
Romanus slew the dragon and its severed head was mounted on the walls of the city as the first gargoyle.Dragons are prominent in medieval heraldry|dragon
Uther Pendragon was famously said to have had two gold dragons crowned with red standing back-to-back on his royal coat of arms|dragon
"Originally, heraldic dragons could have any number of legs, but, by the late Middle Ages, due to the widespread proliferation of bestiaries, heraldry began to distinguish between a ""dragon"" (which could only have exactly four legs) and a ""wyvern"" (which could only have exactly two)"|dragon
In myths, wyverns are associated with viciousness, envy, and pestilence, but, in heraldry, they are used as symbols for overthrowing the tyranny of Satan and his demonic forces|dragon
"Late medieval heraldry also distinguished a draconic creature known as a ""cockatrice"""|dragon
A cockatrice is supposedly born when a serpent hatches an egg that has been laid on a dunghill by a rooster and it is so venomous that its breath and its gaze are both lethal to any living creature, except for a weasel, which is the cockatrice's mortal enemy|dragon
A basilisk is a serpent with the head of a dragon at the end of its tail that is born when a toad hatches an egg that has been laid in a midden by a nine-year-old cockatrice|dragon
Like the cockatrice, its glare is said to be deadly.|dragon
In Albanian mythology and folklore, stihi, ljubi, bolla, bollar, errshaja and kulshedra are mythological figures described as serpentine dragons|dragon
It is believed that bolla, a water and chthonic demonic serpent, undergoes metamorphosis passing through four distinct phases if it lives many years without being seen by a human|dragon
The bollar and errshaja are the intermediate stages, while the kulshedra is the ultimate phase, described as a huge multi-headed fire-spitting female serpent which causes drought, storms, flooding, earthquakes and other natural disasters against mankind|dragon
She is usually fought and defeated by a drangue, a semi-human winged divine hero and protector of humans|dragon
"Heavy thunderstorms are thought to be the result of their battles.In Slavic mythology, the words ""zmey"", ""zmiy"" or ""zmaj"" are used to describe dragons"|dragon
"These words are masculine forms of the Slavic word for ""snake"", which are normally feminine (like Russian zmeya)"|dragon
In Romania, there is a similar figure, derived from the Slavic dragon and named zmeu|dragon
Exclusively in Polish and Belarusian folklore, as well as in the other Slavic folklores, a dragon is also called (variously) смок, цмок, or smok|dragon
In South Slavic folklores, the same thing is also called lamya (ламя, ламjа, lamja)|dragon
Although quite similar to other European dragons, Slavic dragons have their peculiarities.|dragon
In Russian and Ukrainian folklore, Zmey Gorynych is a dragon with three heads, each one bearing twin goatlike horns|dragon
He is said to have breathed fire and smelled of sulfur|dragon
It was believed that eclipses were caused by Gorynych temporarily swallowing the sun|dragon
According to one legend, Gorynych's uncle was the evil sorcerer Nemal Chelovek, who abducted the daughter of the tsar and imprisoned her in his castle in the Ural Mountains|dragon
Many knights tried to free her, but all of them were killed by Gorynych's fire|dragon
Then a palace guard in Moscow named Ivan Tsarevich overheard two crows talking about the princess|dragon
He went to the tsar, who gave him a magic sword, and snuck into the castle|dragon
When Chelovek attacked Ivan in the form of a giant, the sword flew from Ivan's hand unbidden and killed him|dragon
Then the sword cut off all three of Gorynych's heads at once|dragon
Ivan brought the princess back to the tsar, who declared Ivan a nobleman and allowed him to marry the princess.A popular Polish folk tale is the legend of the Wawel Dragon, which is first recorded in the Chronica Polonorum of Wincenty Kadłubek, written between 1190 and 1208|dragon
According to Kadłubek, the dragon appeared during the reign of King Krakus and demanded to be fed a fixed number of cattle every week|dragon
If the villagers failed to provide enough cattle, the dragon would eat the same number of villagers as the number of cattle they had failed to provide|dragon
Krakus ordered his sons to slay the dragon|dragon
Since they could not slay it by hand, they tricked the dragon into eating calfskins filled with burning sulfur|dragon
Once the dragon was dead, the younger brother attacked and murdered his older brother and returned home to claim all the glory for himself, telling his father that his brother had died fighting the dragon|dragon
The younger brother became king after his father died, but his secret was eventually revealed and he was banished|dragon
In the fifteenth century, Jan Długosz rewrote the story so that King Krakus himself was the one who slew the dragon|dragon
Another version of the story told by Marcin Bielski instead has the clever shoemaker Skuba come up with the idea for slaying the dragon|dragon
Bielski's version is now the most popular.|dragon
Dragons and dragon motifs are featured in many works of modern literature, particularly within the fantasy genre|dragon
As early as the eighteenth century, critical thinkers such as Denis Diderot were already asserting that too much literature had been published on dragons|dragon
"""There are already in books all too many fabulous stories of dragons"""|dragon
In Lewis Carroll's classic children's novel Through the Looking-Glass (1872), one of the inset poems describes the Jabberwock, a kind of dragon|dragon
Carroll's illustrator John Tenniel, a famous political cartoonist, humorously showed the Jabberwock with the waistcoat, buck teeth, and myopic eyes of a Victorian university lecturer, such as Carroll himself|dragon
In works of comedic children's fantasy, dragons often fulfill the role of a magic fairy tale helper|dragon
In such works, rather than being frightening as they are traditionally portrayed, dragons are instead represented as harmless, benevolent, and inferior to humans|dragon
They are sometimes shown living in contact with humans, or in isolated communities of only dragons|dragon
"Though popular in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, ""such comic and idyllic stories"" began to grow increasingly rare after the 1960s, due to demand for more serious children's literature.One of the most iconic modern dragons is Smaug from J"|dragon

"Sandra Martina Schwab writes, ""With a few exceptions, including McCaffrey's Pern novels and the 2002 film Reign of Fire, dragons seem to fit more into the medievalized setting of fantasy literature than into the more technological world of science fiction"|dragon
Indeed, they have been called the emblem of fantasy|dragon
The hero's fight against the dragon emphasizes and celebrates his masculinity, whereas revisionist fantasies of dragons and dragon-slaying often undermine traditional gender roles|dragon
"In children's literature the friendly dragon becomes a powerful ally in battling the child's fears."" The popular role-playing game system Dungeons & Dragons (D&D) makes heavy use of dragons.After recent discoveries in palaeontology, fictional dragons are sometimes represented with no front legs, but (when on the ground) walking on their back feet and the wrists of their wings, like pterosaurs did"|dragon
for example see (in Game of Thrones) and (Smaug, as in the movie).|dragon
Snakes are elongated, limbless, carnivorous reptiles of the suborder Serpentes |snake
Like all other squamates, snakes are ectothermic, amniote vertebrates covered in overlapping scales|snake
Many species of snakes have skulls with several more joints than their lizard ancestors, enabling them to swallow prey much larger than their heads with their highly mobile jaws|snake
To accommodate their narrow bodies, snakes' paired organs (such as kidneys) appear one in front of the other instead of side by side, and most have only one functional lung|snake
Some species retain a pelvic girdle with a pair of vestigial claws on either side of the cloaca|snake
Lizards have evolved elongate bodies without limbs or with greatly reduced limbs about twenty-five times independently via convergent evolution, leading to many lineages of legless lizards|snake
These resemble snakes, but several common groups of legless lizards have eyelids and external ears, which snakes lack, although this rule is not universal (see Amphisbaenia, Dibamidae, and Pygopodidae).|snake
Living snakes are found on every continent except Antarctica, and on most smaller land masses; exceptions include some large islands, such as Ireland, Iceland, Greenland, the Hawaiian archipelago, and the islands of New Zealand, as well as many small islands of the Atlantic and central Pacific oceans|snake
Additionally, sea snakes are widespread throughout the Indian and Pacific oceans|snake
More than twenty families are currently recognized, comprising about 520 genera and about 3,900 species|snake
They range in size from the tiny, 10.4 cm-long (4.1 in) Barbados threadsnake to the reticulated python of 6.95 meters (22.8 ft) in length|snake
The fossil species Titanoboa cerrejonensis was 12.8 meters (42 ft) long|snake
Snakes are thought to have evolved from either burrowing or aquatic lizards, perhaps during the Jurassic period, with the earliest known fossils dating to between 143 and 167 Ma ago|snake
The diversity of modern snakes appeared during the Paleocene epoch (c|snake
66 to 56 Ma ago, after the Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event)|snake
The oldest preserved descriptions of snakes can be found in the Brooklyn Papyrus.|snake
Most species of snake are nonvenomous and those that have venom use it primarily to kill and subdue prey rather than for self-defense|snake
Some possess venom that is potent enough to cause painful injury or death to humans|snake
Nonvenomous snakes either swallow prey alive or kill by constriction.|snake
The English word snake comes from Old English snaca, itself from Proto-Germanic *snak-an- (cf|snake
Germanic Schnake 'ring snake', Swedish snok 'grass snake'), from Proto-Indo-European root *(s)nēg-o- 'to crawl to creep', which also gave sneak as well as Sanskrit nāgá 'snake'|snake
The word ousted adder, as adder went on to narrow in meaning, though in Old English næddre was the general word for snake|snake
The other term, serpent, is from French, ultimately from Indo-European *serp- 'to creep', which also gave Ancient Greek ἕρπω (hérpō) 'I crawl'.|snake
The fossil record of snakes is relatively poor because snake skeletons are typically small and fragile making fossilization uncommon|snake
Fossils readily identifiable as snakes (though often retaining hind limbs) first appear in the fossil record during the Cretaceous period|snake
The earliest known true snake fossils (members of the crown group Serpentes) come from the marine simoliophiids, the oldest of which is the Late Cretaceous (Cenomanian age) Haasiophis terrasanctus, dated to between 112 and 94 million years old.Based on comparative anatomy, there is consensus that snakes descended from lizards.|snake
11  Pythons and boas—primitive groups among modern snakes—have vestigial hind limbs|snake
tiny, clawed digits known as anal spurs, which are used to grasp during mating.|snake
11  The families Leptotyphlopidae and Typhlopidae also possess remnants of the pelvic girdle, appearing as horny projections when visible.|snake
Front limbs are nonexistent in all known snakes|snake
This is caused by the evolution of their Hox genes, controlling limb morphogenesis|snake
The axial skeleton of the snakes’ common ancestor, like most other tetrapods, had regional specializations consisting of cervical (neck), thoracic (chest), lumbar (lower back), sacral (pelvic), and caudal (tail) vertebrae|snake
Early in snake evolution, the Hox gene expression in the axial skeleton responsible for the development of the thorax became dominant|snake
As a result, the vertebrae anterior to the hindlimb buds (when present) all have the same thoracic-like identity (except from the atlas, axis, and 1–3 neck vertebrae)|snake
In other words, most of a snake's skeleton is an extremely extended thorax|snake
Ribs are found exclusively on the thoracic vertebrae|snake
Neck, lumbar and pelvic vertebrae are very reduced in number (only 2–10 lumbar and pelvic vertebrae are present), while only a short tail remains of the caudal vertebrae|snake
However, the tail is still long enough to be of important use in many species, and is modified in some aquatic and tree-dwelling species.|snake
Many modern snake groups originated during the Paleocene, alongside the adaptive radiation of mammals following the extinction of (non-avian) dinosaurs|snake
The expansion of grasslands in North America also led to an explosive radiation among snakes|snake
Previously, snakes were a minor component of the North American fauna, but during the Miocene, the number of species and their prevalence increased dramatically with the first appearances of vipers and elapids in North America and the significant diversification of Colubridae (including the origin of many modern genera such as Nerodia, Lampropeltis, Pituophis, and Pantherophis).|snake
There is fossil evidence to suggest that snakes may have evolved from burrowing lizards, during the Cretaceous Period|snake
An early fossil snake relative, Najash rionegrina, was a two-legged burrowing animal with a sacrum, and was fully terrestrial|snake
One extant analog of these putative ancestors is the earless monitor Lanthanotus of Borneo (though it also is semiaquatic)|snake
Subterranean species evolved bodies streamlined for burrowing, and eventually lost their limbs|snake
According to this hypothesis, features such as the transparent, fused eyelids (brille) and loss of external ears evolved to cope with fossorial difficulties, such as scratched corneas and dirt in the ears|snake
Some primitive snakes are known to have possessed hindlimbs, but their pelvic bones lacked a direct connection to the vertebrae|snake
These include fossil species like Haasiophis, Pachyrhachis and Eupodophis, which are slightly older than Najash.This hypothesis was strengthened in 2015 by the discovery of a 113-million-year-old fossil of a four-legged snake in Brazil that has been named Tetrapodophis amplectus|snake
It has many snake-like features, is adapted for burrowing and its stomach indicates that it was preying on other animals|snake
It is currently uncertain if Tetrapodophis is a snake or another species, in the squamate order, as a snake-like body has independently evolved at least 26 times|snake
Tetrapodophis does not have distinctive snake features in its spine and skull|snake
A study in 2021 places the animal in a group of extinct marine lizards from the Cretaceous period known as dolichosaurs and not directly related to snakes.An alternative hypothesis, based on morphology, suggests the ancestors of snakes were related to mosasaurs—extinct aquatic reptiles from the Cretaceous—forming the clade Pythonomorpha|snake
According to this hypothesis, the fused, transparent eyelids of snakes are thought to have evolved to combat marine conditions (corneal water loss through osmosis), and the external ears were lost through disuse in an aquatic environment|snake
This ultimately led to an animal similar to today's sea snakes|snake
In the Late Cretaceous, snakes recolonized land, and continued to diversify into today's snakes|snake
Fossilized snake remains are known from early Late Cretaceous marine sediments, which is consistent with this hypothesis; particularly so, as they are older than the terrestrial Najash rionegrina|snake
Similar skull structure, reduced or absent limbs, and other anatomical features found in both mosasaurs and snakes lead to a positive cladistical correlation, although some of these features are shared with varanids.|snake
Genetic studies in recent years have indicated snakes are not as closely related to monitor lizards as was once believed—and therefore not to mosasaurs, the proposed ancestor in the aquatic scenario of their evolution|snake
However, more evidence links mosasaurs to snakes than to varanids|snake
Fragmented remains found from the Jurassic and Early Cretaceous indicate deeper fossil records for these groups, which may potentially refute either hypothesis.In 2016, two studies reported that limb loss in snakes is associated with DNA mutations in the Zone of Polarizing Activity Regulatory Sequence (ZRS), a regulatory region of the sonic hedgehog gene which is critically required for limb development|snake
More advanced snakes have no remnants of limbs, but basal snakes such as pythons and boas do have traces of highly reduced, vestigial hind limbs|snake
Python embryos even have fully developed hind limb buds, but their later development is stopped by the DNA mutations in the ZRS.|snake
There are about 3,900 species of snakes, ranging as far northward as the Arctic Circle in Scandinavia and southward through Australia|snake
Snakes can be found on every continent except Antarctica, as well as in the sea, and as high as 16,000 feet (4,900 m) in the Himalayan Mountains of Asia.|snake
143  There are numerous islands from which snakes are absent, such as Ireland, Iceland, and New Zealand (although New Zealand's waters are infrequently visited by the yellow-bellied sea snake and the banded sea krait).|snake
All modern snakes are grouped within the suborder Serpentes in Linnean taxonomy, part of the order Squamata, though their precise placement within squamates remains controversial.The two infraorders of Serpentes are|snake
Alethinophidia and Scolecophidia|snake
This separation is based on morphological characteristics and mitochondrial DNA sequence similarity|snake
"Alethinophidia is sometimes split into Henophidia and Caenophidia, with the latter consisting of ""colubroid"" snakes (colubrids, vipers, elapids, hydrophiids, and atractaspids) and acrochordids, while the other alethinophidian families comprise Henophidia"|snake
While not extant today, the Madtsoiidae, a family of giant, primitive, python-like snakes, was around until 50,000 years ago in Australia, represented by genera such as Wonambi.|snake
There are numerous debates in the systematics within the group|snake
For instance, many sources classify Boidae and Pythonidae as one family, while some keep the Elapidae and Hydrophiidae (sea snakes) separate for practical reasons despite their extremely close relation.|snake
While snakes are limbless reptiles, evolved from (and grouped with) lizards, there are many other species of lizards that have lost their limbs independently but which superficially look similar to snakes|snake
These include the slowworm and glass snake.|snake
The now extinct Titanoboa cerrejonensis was 12.8 m (42 ft) in length|snake
By comparison, the largest extant snakes are the reticulated python, measuring about 6.95 m (22.8 ft) long, and the green anaconda, which measures about 5.21 m (17.1 ft) long and is considered the heaviest snake on Earth at 97.5 kg (215 lb).At the other end of the scale, the smallest extant snake is Leptotyphlops carlae, with a length of about 10.4 cm (4.1 in)|snake
Most snakes are fairly small animals, approximately 1 m (3.3 ft) in length.|snake
"Pit vipers, pythons, and some boas have infrared-sensitive receptors in deep grooves on the snout, allowing them to ""see"" the radiated heat of warm-blooded prey"|snake
"In pit vipers, the grooves are located between the nostril and the eye in a large ""pit"" on each side of the head"|snake
Other infrared-sensitive snakes have multiple, smaller labial pits lining the upper lip, just below the nostrils.A snake tracks its prey using smell, collecting airborne particles with its forked tongue, then passing them to the vomeronasal organ or Jacobson's organ in the mouth for examination|snake
The fork in the tongue provides a sort of directional sense of smell and taste simultaneously|snake
The snake's tongue is constantly in motion, sampling particles from the air, ground, and water, analyzing the chemicals found, and determining the presence of prey or predators in the local environment|snake
In water-dwelling snakes, such as the anaconda, the tongue functions efficiently underwater.|snake
The underside of a snake is very sensitive to vibration, allowing the snake to detect approaching animals by sensing faint vibrations in the ground.Snake vision varies greatly between species|snake
Some have keen eyesight and others are only able to distinguish light from dark, but the important trend is that a snake's visual perception is adequate enough to track movements|snake
Generally, vision is best in tree-dwelling snakes and weakest in burrowing snakes|snake
Some have binocular vision, where both eyes are capable of focusing on the same point, an example of this being the Asian vine snake|snake
Most snakes focus by moving the lens back and forth in relation to the retina|snake
Diurnal snakes have round pupils and many nocturnal snakes have slit pupils|snake
Most species possess three visual pigments and are probably able to see two primary colors in daylight|snake
It has been concluded that the last common ancestors of all snakes had UV-sensitive vision, but most snakes that depend on their eyesight to hunt in daylight have evolved lenses that act like sunglasses for filtering out the UV-light, which probably also sharpens their vision by improving the contrast.|snake
The skin of a snake is covered in scales|snake
Contrary to the popular notion of snakes being slimy (because of possible confusion of snakes with worms), snakeskin has a smooth, dry texture|snake
Most snakes use specialized belly scales to travel, allowing them to grip surfaces|snake
The body scales may be smooth, keeled, or granular|snake
"The eyelids of a snake are transparent ""spectacle"" scales, also known as brille, which remain permanently closed."|snake
The shedding of scales is called ecdysis (or in normal usage, molting or sloughing)|snake
Snakes shed the complete outer layer of skin in one piece|snake
Snake scales are not discrete, but extensions of the epidermis—hence they are not shed separately but as a complete outer layer during each molt, akin to a sock being turned inside out.Snakes have a wide diversity of skin coloration patterns which are often related to behavior, such as the tendency to have to flee from predators|snake
Snakes that are at a high risk of predation tend to be plain, or have longitudinal stripes, providing few reference points to predators, thus allowing the snake to escape without being noticed|snake
Plain snakes usually adopt active hunting strategies, as their pattern allows them to send little information to prey about motion|snake
Blotched snakes usually use ambush-based strategies, likely because it helps them blend into an environment with irregularly shaped objects, like sticks or rocks|snake
Spotted patterning can similarly help snakes to blend into their environment.The shape and number of scales on the head, back, and belly are often characteristic and used for taxonomic purposes|snake
Scales are named mainly according to their positions on the body|snake
"In ""advanced"" (Caenophidian) snakes, the broad belly scales and rows of dorsal scales correspond to the vertebrae, allowing these to be counted without the need for dissection."|snake
"Molting (or ""ecdysis"") serves a number of purposes"|snake
Firstly, the old and worn skin is replaced, and secondly, it helps get rid of parasites such as mites and ticks|snake
Renewal of the skin by molting supposedly allows growth in some animals such as insects, but this has been disputed in the case of snakes.Molting occurs periodically throughout the life of a snake|snake
Before each molt, the snake stops eating and often hides or moves to a safe place|snake
Just before shedding, the skin becomes dull and dry looking and the snake's eyes turn cloudy or blue-colored|snake
The inner surface of the old skin liquefies, causing it to separate from the new skin beneath it|snake
"After a few days, the eyes become clear and the snake ""crawls"" out of its old skin, which splits close to the snake's mouth"|snake
The snake rubs its body against rough surfaces to aid in the shedding of its old skin|snake
In many cases, the cast skin peels backward over the body from head to tail in one piece, like pulling a sock off inside-out, revealing a new, larger, brighter layer of skin which has formed underneath.A young snake that is still growing may shed its skin up to four times a year, but an older snake may shed only once or twice a year|snake
The discarded skin carries a perfect imprint of the scale pattern, so it is usually possible to identify the snake from the cast skin if it is reasonably intact|snake
This periodic renewal has led to the snake being a symbol of healing and medicine, as pictured in the Rod of Asclepius.Scale counts can sometimes be used to identify the sex of a snake when the species is not distinctly sexually dimorphic|snake
A probe is fully inserted into the cloaca, marked at the point where it stops, then removed and measured against the subcaudal scales|snake
The scalation count determines whether the snake is a male or female, as the hemipenes of a male will probe to a different depth (usually longer) than the cloaca of a female.|snake
The skull consists of a solid and complete neurocranium, to which many of the other bones are only loosely attached, particularly the highly mobile jaw bones, which facilitate manipulation and ingestion of large prey items|snake
The left and right sides of the lower jaw are joined together only by a flexible ligament at the anterior tips, allowing them to separate widely, and the posterior end of the lower jaw bones articulate with a quadrate bone, allowing further mobility|snake
The mandible and quadrate bones can pick up ground-borne vibrations; because the sides of the lower jaw can move independently of one another, a snake resting its jaw on a surface has sensitive stereo auditory perception, used for detecting the position of prey|snake
The jaw–quadrate–stapes pathway is capable of detecting vibrations on the angstrom scale, despite the absence of an outer ear and the lack of an impedance matching mechanism—provided by the ossicles in other vertebrates—for receiving vibrations from the air.The hyoid is a small bone located posterior and ventral to the skull, in the 'neck' region, which serves as an attachment for the muscles of the snake's tongue, as it does in all other tetrapods.|snake
The vertebral column consists of between 200 and 400 vertebrae, or sometimes more|snake
The body vertebrae each have two ribs articulating with them|snake
The tail vertebrae are comparatively few in number (often less than 20% of the total) and lack ribs|snake
The vertebrae have projections that allow for strong muscle attachment, enabling locomotion without limbs.|snake
Caudal autotomy (self-amputation of the tail), a feature found in some lizards, is absent in most snakes|snake
In the rare cases where it does exist in snakes, caudal autotomy is intervertebral (meaning the separation of adjacent vertebrae), unlike that in lizards, which is intravertebral, i.e|snake
the break happens along a predefined fracture plane present on a vertebra.In some snakes, most notably boas and pythons, there are vestiges of the hindlimbs in the form of a pair of pelvic spurs|snake
These small, claw-like protrusions on each side of the cloaca are the external portion of the vestigial hindlimb skeleton, which includes the remains of an ilium and femur.|snake
Snakes and other reptiles have a three-chambered heart that controls the circulatory system via the left and right atrium, and one ventricle|snake
Internally, the ventricle is divided into three interconnected cavities|snake
the cavum arteriosum, the cavum pulmonale, and the cavum venosum|snake
The cavum venosum receives deoxygenated blood from the right atrium and the cavum arteriosum receives oxygenated blood from the left atrium|snake
Located beneath the cavum venosum is the cavum pulmonale, which pumps blood to the pulmonary trunk.The snake's heart is encased in a sac, called the pericardium, located at the bifurcation of the bronchi|snake
The heart is able to move around, owing to the lack of a diaphragm; this adjustment protects the heart from potential damage when large ingested prey is passed through the esophagus|snake
The spleen is attached to the gall bladder and pancreas and filters the blood|snake
The thymus, located in fatty tissue above the heart, is responsible for the generation of immune cells in the blood|snake
The cardiovascular system of snakes is unique for the presence of a renal portal system in which the blood from the snake's tail passes through the kidneys before returning to the heart.The vestigial left lung is often small or sometimes even absent, as snakes' tubular bodies require all of their organs to be long and thin|snake
In the majority of species, only one lung is functional|snake
This lung contains a vascularized anterior portion and a posterior portion that does not function in gas exchange|snake
This 'saccular lung' is used for hydrostatic purposes to adjust buoyancy in some aquatic snakes and its function remains unknown in terrestrial species|snake
Many organs that are paired, such as kidneys or reproductive organs, are staggered within the body, one located ahead of the other.Snakes have no lymph nodes.|snake
Cobras, vipers, and closely related species use venom to immobilize, injure, or kill their prey|snake
The venom is modified saliva, delivered through fangs.|snake
243  The fangs of 'advanced' venomous snakes like viperids and elapids are hollow, allowing venom to be injected more effectively, and the fangs of rear-fanged snakes such as the boomslang simply have a groove on the posterior edge to channel venom into the wound|snake
Snake venoms are often prey-specific, and their role in self-defense is secondary.|snake
243 Venom, like all salivary secretions, is a predigestant that initiates the breakdown of food into soluble compounds, facilitating proper digestion|snake
Even nonvenomous snakebites (like any animal bite) cause tissue damage.|snake
209 Certain birds, mammals, and other snakes (such as kingsnakes) that prey on venomous snakes have developed resistance and even immunity to certain venoms.|snake
243  Venomous snakes include three families of snakes, and do not constitute a formal taxonomic classification group.|snake
"The colloquial term ""poisonous snake"" is generally an incorrect label for snakes"|snake
A poison is inhaled or ingested, whereas venom produced by snakes is injected into its victim via fangs|snake
There are, however, two exceptions|snake
Rhabdophis sequesters toxins from the toads it eats, then secretes them from nuchal glands to ward off predators; and a small unusual population of garter snakes in the US state of Oregon retains enough toxins in their livers from ingested newts to be effectively poisonous to small local predators (such as crows and foxes).Snake venoms are complex mixtures of proteins, and are stored in venom glands at the back of the head|snake
In all venomous snakes, these glands open through ducts into grooved or hollow teeth in the upper jaw.|snake
243  The proteins can potentially be a mix of neurotoxins (which attack the nervous system), hemotoxins (which attack the circulatory system), cytotoxins, bungarotoxins, and many other toxins that affect the body in different ways|snake
Almost all snake venom contains hyaluronidase, an enzyme that ensures rapid diffusion of the venom.|snake
243 Venomous snakes that use hemotoxins usually have fangs in the front of their mouths, making it easier for them to inject the venom into their victims|snake
Some snakes that use neurotoxins (such as the mangrove snake) have fangs in the back of their mouths, with the fangs curled backwards|snake
This makes it difficult both for the snake to use its venom and for scientists to milk them|snake
"Elapids, however, such as cobras and kraits are proteroglyphous—they possess hollow fangs that cannot be erected toward the front of their mouths, and cannot ""stab"" like a viper"|snake
They must actually bite the victim.|snake
242 It has been suggested that all snakes may be venomous to a certain degree, with harmless snakes having weak venom and no fangs|snake
"According to this theory, most snakes that are labelled ""nonvenomous"" would be considered harmless because they either lack a venom delivery method or are incapable of delivering enough to endanger a human"|snake
The theory postulates that snakes may have evolved from a common lizard ancestor that was venomous, and also that venomous lizards like the gila monster, beaded lizard, monitor lizards, and the now-extinct mosasaurs, may have derived from this same common ancestor|snake
"They share this ""venom clade"" with various other saurian species."|snake
Colubrids – boomslangs, tree snakes, vine snakes, cat snakes, although not all colubrids are venomous.|snake
209|snake
Although a wide range of reproductive modes are used by snakes, all employ internal fertilization|snake
This is accomplished by means of paired, forked hemipenes, which are stored, inverted, in the male's tail|snake
The hemipenes are often grooved, hooked, or spined—designed to grip the walls of the female's cloaca.Most species of snakes lay eggs which they abandon shortly after laying|snake
However, a few species (such as the king cobra) construct nests and stay in the vicinity of the hatchlings after incubation|snake
Most pythons coil around their egg-clutches and remain with them until they hatch|snake
A female python will not leave the eggs, except to occasionally bask in the sun or drink water|snake
"She will even ""shiver"" to generate heat to incubate the eggs.Some species of snake are ovoviviparous and retain the eggs within their bodies until they are almost ready to hatch"|snake
Several species of snake, such as the boa constrictor and green anaconda, are fully viviparous, nourishing their young through a placenta as well as a yolk sac; this is highly unusual among reptiles, and normally found in requiem sharks or placental mammals|snake
Retention of eggs and live birth are most often associated with colder environments.|snake
Sexual selection in snakes is demonstrated by the 3,000 species that each use different tactics in acquiring mates|snake
Ritual combat between males for the females they want to mate with includes topping, a behavior exhibited by most viperids in which one male will twist around the vertically elevated fore body of its opponent and force it downward|snake
It is common for neck-biting to occur while the snakes are entwined.|snake
Parthenogenesis is a natural form of reproduction in which growth and development of embryos occur without fertilization|snake
Agkistrodon contortrix (copperhead) and Agkistrodon piscivorus (cottonmouth) can reproduce by facultative parthenogenesis, meaning that they are capable of switching from a sexual mode of reproduction to an asexual mode|snake
The most likely type of parthenogenesis to occur is automixis with terminal fusion, a process in which two terminal products from the same meiosis fuse to form a diploid zygote|snake
This process leads to genome-wide homozygosity, expression of deleterious recessive alleles, and often to developmental abnormalities|snake
Both captive-born and wild-born copperheads and cottonmouths appear to be capable of this form of parthenogenesis.Reproduction in squamate reptiles is almost exclusively sexual|snake
Males ordinarily have a ZZ pair of sex-determining chromosomes, and females a ZW pair|snake
However, the Colombian Rainbow boa (Epicrates maurus) can also reproduce by facultative parthenogenesis, resulting in production of WW female progeny|snake
The WW females are likely produced by terminal automixis.|snake
In regions where winters are too cold for snakes to tolerate while remaining active, local species will enter a period of brumation|snake
Unlike hibernation, in which the dormant mammals are actually asleep, brumating reptiles are awake but inactive|snake
Individual snakes may brumate in burrows, under rock piles, or inside fallen trees, or large numbers of snakes may clump together in hibernacula.|snake
All snakes are strictly carnivorous, preying on small animals including lizards, frogs, other snakes, small mammals, birds, eggs, fish, snails, worms, and insects.[1] Snakes cannot bite or tear their food to pieces so must swallow their prey whole|snake
The eating habits of a snake are largely influenced by body size; smaller snakes eat smaller prey|snake
Juvenile pythons might start out feeding on lizards or mice and graduate to small deer or antelope as an adult, for example.|snake
The snake's jaw is a complex structure|snake
Contrary to the popular belief that snakes can dislocate their jaws, they have an extremely flexible lower jaw, the two halves of which are not rigidly attached, and numerous other joints in the skull, which allow the snake to open its mouth wide enough to swallow prey whole, even if it is larger in diameter than the snake itself|snake
For example, the African egg-eating snake has flexible jaws adapted for eating eggs much larger than the diameter of its head.|snake
81  This snake has no teeth, but does have bony protrusions on the inside edge of its spine, which it uses to break the shell when eating eggs.|snake
81 |snake
The majority of snakes eat a variety of prey animals, but there is some specialization in certain species|snake
King cobras and the Australian bandy-bandy consume other snakes|snake
Species of the family Pareidae have more teeth on the right side of their mouths than on the left, as they mostly prey on snails and the shells usually spiral clockwise.|snake
184 Some snakes have a venomous bite, which they use to kill their prey before eating it|snake
Other snakes kill their prey by constriction, while some swallow their prey when it is still alive.|snake
81 |snake
After eating, snakes become dormant to allow the process of digestion to take place; this is an intense activity, especially after consumption of large prey|snake
In species that feed only sporadically, the entire intestine enters a reduced state between meals to conserve energy|snake
The digestive system is then 'up-regulated' to full capacity within 48 hours of prey consumption|snake
"Being ectothermic (""cold-blooded""), the surrounding temperature plays an important role in the digestion process"|snake
The ideal temperature for snakes to digest food is 30 °C (86 °F)|snake
There is a huge amount of metabolic energy involved in a snake's digestion, for example the surface body temperature of the South American rattlesnake (Crotalus durissus)  increases by as much as 1.2 °C (2.2 °F) during the digestive process|snake
If a snake is disturbed after having eaten recently, it will often regurgitate its prey to be able to escape the perceived threat|snake
When undisturbed, the digestive process is highly efficient; the snake's digestive enzymes dissolve and absorb everything but the prey's hair (or feathers) and claws, which are excreted along with waste.|snake
Hooding (expansion of the neck area) is a visual deterrent, mostly seen in cobras (elapids), and is primarily controlled by rib muscles|snake
Hooding can be accompanied by spitting venom towards the threatening object, and producing a specialized sound; hissing|snake
Studies on captive cobras showed that 13 to 22% of the body length is raised during hooding.|snake
The lack of limbs does not impede the movement of snakes|snake
They have developed several different modes of locomotion to deal with particular environments|snake
Unlike the gaits of limbed animals, which form a continuum, each mode of snake locomotion is discrete and distinct from the others; transitions between modes are abrupt.|snake
Lateral undulation is the sole mode of aquatic locomotion, and the most common mode of terrestrial locomotion|snake
"In this mode, the body of the snake alternately flexes to the left and right, resulting in a series of rearward-moving ""waves"""|snake
While this movement appears rapid, snakes have rarely been documented moving faster than two body-lengths per second, often much less|snake
This mode of movement has the same net cost of transport (calories burned per meter moved) as running in lizards of the same mass.Terrestrial lateral undulation is the most common mode of terrestrial locomotion for most snake species|snake
In this mode, the posteriorly moving waves push against contact points in the environment, such as rocks, twigs, irregularities in the soil, etc|snake
Each of these environmental objects, in turn, generates a reaction force directed forward and towards the midline of the snake, resulting in forward thrust while the lateral components cancel out|snake
The speed of this movement depends upon the density of push-points in the environment, with a medium density of about 8 along the snake's length being ideal|snake
The wave speed is precisely the same as the snake speed, and as a result, every point on the snake's body follows the path of the point ahead of it, allowing snakes to move through very dense vegetation and small openings.When swimming, the waves become larger as they move down the snake's body, and the wave travels backwards faster than the snake moves forwards|snake
Thrust is generated by pushing their body against the water, resulting in the observed slip|snake
In spite of overall similarities, studies show that the pattern of muscle activation is different in aquatic versus terrestrial lateral undulation, which justifies calling them separate modes|snake
All snakes can laterally undulate forward (with backward-moving waves), but only sea snakes have been observed reversing the motion (moving backwards with forward-moving waves).|snake
"Most often employed by colubroid snakes (colubrids, elapids, and vipers) when the snake must move in an environment that lacks irregularities to push against (rendering lateral undulation impossible), such as a slick mud flat, or a sand dune, sidewinding is a modified form of lateral undulation in which all of the body segments oriented in one direction remain in contact with the ground, while the other segments are lifted up, resulting in a peculiar ""rolling"" motion"|snake
This mode of locomotion overcomes the slippery nature of sand or mud by pushing off with only static portions on the body, thereby minimizing slipping|snake
The static nature of the contact points can be shown from the tracks of a sidewinding snake, which show each belly scale imprint, without any smearing|snake
This mode of locomotion has very low caloric cost, less than ⅓ of the cost for a lizard to move the same distance|snake
Contrary to popular belief, there is no evidence that sidewinding is associated with the sand being hot.|snake
When push-points are absent, but there is not enough space to use sidewinding because of lateral constraints, such as in tunnels, snakes rely on concertina locomotion|snake
In this mode, the snake braces the posterior portion of its body against the tunnel wall while the front of the snake extends and straightens|snake
The front portion then flexes and forms an anchor point, and the posterior is straightened and pulled forwards|snake
This mode of locomotion is slow and very demanding, up to seven times the cost of laterally undulating over the same distance|snake
This high cost is due to the repeated stops and starts of portions of the body as well as the necessity of using active muscular effort to brace against the tunnel walls.|snake
The movement of snakes in arboreal habitats has only recently been studied|snake
While on tree branches, snakes use several modes of locomotion depending on species and bark texture|snake
In general, snakes will use a modified form of concertina locomotion on smooth branches, but will laterally undulate if contact points are available|snake
Snakes move faster on small branches and when contact points are present, in contrast to limbed animals, which do better on large branches with little 'clutter'.Gliding snakes (Chrysopelea) of Southeast Asia launch themselves from branch tips, spreading their ribs and laterally undulating as they glide between trees|snake
These snakes can perform a controlled glide for hundreds of feet depending upon launch altitude and can even turn in midair.|snake
The slowest mode of snake locomotion is rectilinear locomotion, which is also the only one where the snake does not need to bend its body laterally, though it may do so when turning|snake
In this mode, the belly scales are lifted and pulled forward before being placed down and the body pulled over them|snake
Waves of movement and stasis pass posteriorly, resulting in a series of ripples in the skin|snake
The ribs of the snake do not move in this mode of locomotion and this method is most often used by large pythons, boas, and vipers when stalking prey across open ground as the snake's movements are subtle and harder to detect by their prey in this manner.|snake
Snakes do not ordinarily prey on humans|snake
Unless startled or injured, most snakes prefer to avoid contact and will not attack humans|snake
With the exception of large constrictors, nonvenomous snakes are not a threat to humans|snake
The bite of a nonvenomous snake is usually harmless; their teeth are not adapted for tearing or inflicting a deep puncture wound, but rather grabbing and holding|snake
Although the possibility of infection and tissue damage is present in the bite of a nonvenomous snake, venomous snakes present far greater hazard to humans.|snake
"209  The World Health Organisation (WHO) lists snakebite under the ""other neglected conditions"" category.Documented deaths resulting from snake bites are uncommon"|snake
Nonfatal bites from venomous snakes may result in the need for amputation of a limb or part thereof|snake
Of the roughly 725 species of venomous snakes worldwide, only 250 are able to kill a human with one bite|snake
Australia averages only one fatal snake bite per year|snake
In India, 250,000 snakebites are recorded in a single year, with as many as 50,000 recorded initial deaths|snake
The WHO estimates that on the order of 100 000 people die each year as a result of snake bites, and around three times as many amputations and other permanent disabilities are caused by snakebites annually.The treatment for a snakebite is as variable as the bite itself|snake
The most common and effective method is through antivenom (or antivenin), a serum made from the venom of the snake|snake
Some antivenom is species-specific (monovalent) while some is made for use with multiple species in mind (polyvalent)|snake
In the United States for example, all species of venomous snakes are pit vipers, with the exception of the coral snake|snake
To produce antivenom, a mixture of the venoms of the different species of rattlesnakes, copperheads, and cottonmouths is injected into the body of a horse in ever-increasing dosages until the horse is immunized|snake
Blood is then extracted from the immunized horse|snake
The serum is separated and further purified and freeze-dried|snake
It is reconstituted with sterile water and becomes antivenom|snake
For this reason, people who are allergic to horses are more likely to suffer an allergic reaction to antivenom|snake
Antivenom for the more dangerous species (such as mambas, taipans, and cobras) is made in a similar manner in India, South Africa, and Australia, although these antivenoms are species-specific.|snake
In some parts of the world, especially in India, snake charming is a roadside show performed by a charmer|snake
In such a show, the snake charmer carries a basket containing a snake that he seemingly charms by playing tunes with his flutelike musical instrument, to which the snake responds|snake
The snake is in fact responding to the movement of the flute, not the sound it makes, as snakes lack external ears (though they do have internal ears).The Wildlife Protection Act of 1972 in India technically prohibits snake charming on the grounds of reducing animal cruelty|snake
Other types of snake charmers use a snake and mongoose show, where the two animals have a mock fight; however, this is not very common, as the animals may be seriously injured or killed|snake
Snake charming as a profession is dying out in India because of competition from modern forms of entertainment and environment laws proscribing the practice|snake
Many Indians have never seen snake charming and it is becoming a folktale of the past.|snake
The Irulas tribe of Andhra Pradesh and Tamil Nadu in India have been hunter-gatherers in the hot, dry plains forests, and have practiced the art of snake catching for generations|snake
They have a vast knowledge of snakes in the field|snake
They generally catch the snakes with the help of a simple stick|snake
Earlier, the Irulas caught thousands of snakes for the snake-skin industry|snake
After the complete ban of the snake-skin industry in India and protection of all snakes under the Indian Wildlife (Protection) Act 1972, they formed the Irula Snake Catcher's Cooperative and switched to catching snakes for removal of venom, releasing them in the wild after four extractions|snake
The venom so collected is used for producing life-saving antivenom, biomedical research and for other medicinal products|snake
The Irulas are also known to eat some of the snakes they catch and are very useful in rat extermination in the villages.|snake
Despite the existence of snake charmers, there have also been professional snake catchers or wranglers|snake
Modern-day snake trapping involves a herpetologist using a long stick with a V- shaped end|snake
Some television show hosts, like Bill Haast, Austin Stevens, Steve Irwin, and Jeff Corwin, prefer to catch them using bare hands.|snake
Although snakes are not commonly thought of as food, their consumption is acceptable in some cultures and may even be considered a delicacy|snake
Snake soup is popular in Cantonese cuisine, consumed by locals in the autumn to warm their bodies|snake
Western cultures document the consumption of snakes only under extreme circumstances of hunger, with the exception of cooked rattlesnake meat, which is commonly consumed in Texas and parts of the Midwestern United States.|snake
In Asian countries such as China, Taiwan, Thailand, Indonesia, Vietnam, and Cambodia, drinking the blood of a snake—particularly the cobra—is believed to increase sexual virility|snake
When possible, the blood is drained while the cobra is still alive, and it is usually mixed with some form of liquor to improve the taste.The use of snakes in alcohol is accepted in some Asian countries|snake
In such cases, one or more snakes are left to steep in a jar or container of liquor, as this is claimed to make the liquor stronger (as well as more expensive)|snake
"One example of this is the Habu snake, which is sometimes placed in the Okinawan liqueur Habushu (ブ酒), also known as ""Habu Sake"".Snake wine (蛇酒) is an alcoholic beverage produced by infusing whole snakes in rice wine or grain alcohol"|snake
First recorded as being consumed in China during the Western Zhou dynasty, this drink is considered an important curative and is believed to reinvigorate a person according to traditional Chinese medicine.|snake
In the Western world, some snakes are kept as pets, especially docile species such as the ball python and corn snake|snake
To meet the demand, a captive breeding industry has developed|snake
Snakes bred in captivity are considered preferable to specimens caught in the wild and tend to make better pets|snake
Compared with more traditional types of companion animal, snakes can be very low-maintenance pets; they require minimal space, as most common species do not exceed 5 feet (1.5 m) in length, and can be fed relatively infrequently—usually once every five to 14 days|snake
Certain snakes have a lifespan of more than 40 years if given proper care.|snake
In ancient Mesopotamia, Nirah, the messenger god of Ištaran, was represented as a serpent on kudurrus, or boundary stones|snake
Representations of two intertwined serpents are common in Sumerian art and Neo-Sumerian artwork and still appear sporadically on cylinder seals and amulets until as late as the thirteenth century BC|snake
The horned viper (Cerastes cerastes) appears in Kassite and Neo-Assyrian kudurrus and is invoked in Assyrian texts as a magical protective entity|snake
A dragon-like creature with horns, the body and neck of a snake, the forelegs of a lion, and the hind-legs of a bird appears in Mesopotamian art from the Akkadian Period until the Hellenistic Period (323 BC–31 BC)|snake
"This creature, known in Akkadian as the mušḫuššu, meaning ""furious serpent"", was used as a symbol for particular deities and also as a general protective emblem"|snake
It seems to have originally been the attendant of the Underworld god Ninazu, but later became the attendant to the Hurrian storm-god Tishpak, as well as, later, Ninazu's son Ningishzida, the Babylonian national god Marduk, the scribal god Nabu, and the Assyrian national god Ashur.In Egyptian history, the snake occupies a primary role with the Nile cobra adorning the crown of the pharaoh in ancient times|snake
It was worshipped as one of the gods and was also used for sinister purposes|snake
murder of an adversary and ritual suicide (Cleopatra)|snake
The ouroboros was a well-known ancient Egyptian symbol of a serpent swallowing its own tail|snake
"The precursor to the ouroboros was the ""Many-Faced"", a serpent with five heads, who, according to the Amduat, the oldest surviving Book of the Afterlife, was said to coil around the corpse of the sun god Ra protectively"|snake
"The earliest surviving depiction of a ""true"" ouroboros comes from the gilded shrines in the tomb of Tutankhamun"|snake
"In the early centuries AD, the ouroboros was adopted as a symbol by Gnostic Christians and chapter 136 of the Pistis Sophia, an early Gnostic text, describes ""a great dragon whose tail is in its mouth"""|snake
"In medieval alchemy, the ouroboros became a typical western dragon with wings, legs, and a tail.In the Bible, King Nahash of Ammon, whose name means ""Snake"", is depicted very negatively, as a particularly cruel and despicable enemy of the ancient Hebrews."|snake
The ancient Greeks used the Gorgoneion, a depiction of a hideous face with serpents for hair, as an apotropaic symbol to ward off evil|snake
In a Greek myth described by Pseudo-Apollodorus in his Bibliotheca, Medusa was a Gorgon with serpents for hair whose gaze turned all those who looked at her to stone and was slain by the hero Perseus|snake
In the Roman poet Ovid's Metamorphoses, Medusa is said to have once been a beautiful priestess of Athena, whom Athena turned into a serpent-haired monster after she was raped by the god Poseidon in Athena's temple|snake
In another myth referenced by the Boeotian poet Hesiod and described in detail by Pseudo-Apollodorus, the hero Heracles is said to have slain the Lernaean Hydra, a multiple-headed serpent which dwelt in the swamps of Lerna.The legendary account of the foundation of Thebes mentioned a monster snake guarding the spring from which the new settlement was to draw its water|snake
"In fighting and killing the snake, the companions of the founder Cadmus all perished – leading to the term ""Cadmean victory"" (i.e"|snake
a victory involving one's own ruin).|snake
India is often called the land of snakes and is steeped in tradition regarding snakes|snake
Snakes are worshipped as gods even today with many women pouring milk on snake pits (despite snakes' aversion for milk)|snake
The cobra is seen on the neck of Shiva and Vishnu is depicted often as sleeping on a seven-headed snake or within the coils of a serpent|snake
There are also several temples in India solely for cobras sometimes called Nagraj (King of Snakes) and it is believed that snakes are symbols of fertility|snake
There is a Hindu festival called Nag Panchami each year on which day snakes are venerated and prayed to|snake
See also Nāga.In India there is another mythology about snakes|snake
"Commonly known in Hindi as ""Ichchhadhari"" snakes"|snake
Such snakes can take the form of any living creature, but prefer human form|snake
"These mythical snakes possess a valuable gem called ""Mani"", which is more brilliant than diamond"|snake
There are many stories in India about greedy people trying to possess this gem and ending up getting killed.The snake is one of the 12 celestial animals of Chinese zodiac, in the Chinese calendar.Many ancient Peruvian cultures worshipped nature|snake
They emphasized animals and often depicted snakes in their art.|snake
Snakes are used in Hinduism as a part of ritual worship|snake
In the annual Nag Panchami festival, participants worship either live cobras or images of Nāgas|snake
Lord Shiva is depicted in most images with a snake coiled around his neck|snake
Puranic literature includes various stories associated with snakes, for example Shesha is said to hold all the planets of the Universe on his hoods and to constantly sing the glories of Vishnu from all his mouths|snake
Other notable snakes in Hinduism are Vasuki, Takshaka, Karkotaka, and Pingala|snake
The term Nāga is used to refer to entities that take the form of large snakes in Hinduism and Buddhism.Snakes have been widely revered in many cultures, such as in ancient Greece where the serpent was seen as a healer|snake
Asclepius carried a serpent wound around his wand, a symbol seen today on many ambulances|snake
In Judaism, the snake of brass is also a symbol of healing, of one's life being saved from imminent death.In religious terms, the snake and jaguar were arguably the most important animals in ancient Mesoamerica|snake
"""In states of ecstasy, lords dance a serpent dance; great descending snakes adorn and support buildings from Chichen Itza to Tenochtitlan, and the Nahuatl word coatl meaning serpent or twin, forms part of primary deities such as Mixcoatl, Quetzalcoatl, and Coatlicue."" In the Maya and Aztec calendars, the fifth day of the week was known as Snake Day."|snake
In some parts of Christianity, the redemptive work of Jesus Christ is compared to saving one's life through beholding the Nehushtan (serpent of brass)|snake
Snake handlers use snakes as an integral part of church worship, to demonstrate their faith in divine protection|snake
However, more commonly in Christianity, the serpent has been depicted as a representative of evil and sly plotting, as seen in the description in Genesis of a snake tempting Eve in the Garden of Eden|snake
Saint Patrick is purported to have expelled all snakes from Ireland while converting the country to Christianity in the 5th century, thus explaining the absence of snakes there.In Christianity and Judaism, the snake makes its infamous appearance in the first book of the Bible when a serpent appears before Adam and Eve and tempts them with the forbidden fruit from the Tree of Knowledge|snake
The snake returns in the Book of Exodus when Moses turns his staff into a snake as a sign of God's power, and later when he makes the Nehushtan, a bronze snake on a pole that when looked at cured the people of bites from the snakes that plagued them in the desert|snake
The serpent makes its final appearance symbolizing Satan in the Book of Revelation|snake
"""And he laid hold on the dragon the old serpent, which is the devil and Satan, and bound him for a thousand years.""In Neo-Paganism and Wicca, the snake is seen as a symbol of wisdom and knowledge."|snake
Several compounds from snake venoms are being researched as potential treatments or preventatives for pain, cancers, arthritis, stroke, heart disease, hemophilia, and hypertension, and to control bleeding (e.g|snake
during surgery).|snake

Sheep (Ovis aries) are quadrupedal, ruminant mammals typically kept as livestock|sheep
Like all ruminants, sheep are members of the order Artiodactyla, the even-toed ungulates|sheep
Although the name sheep applies to many species in the genus Ovis, in everyday usage it almost always refers to Ovis aries|sheep
Numbering a little over one billion, domestic sheep are also the most numerous species of sheep|sheep
An adult female is referred to as a ewe (), an intact male as a ram, occasionally a tup, a castrated male as a wether, and a young sheep as a lamb.|sheep
Sheep are most likely descended from the wild mouflon of Europe and Asia, with Iran being a geographic envelope of the domestication center|sheep
One of the earliest animals to be domesticated for agricultural purposes, sheep are raised for fleeces, meat (lamb, hogget or mutton) and milk|sheep
A sheep's wool is the most widely used animal fiber, and is usually harvested by shearing|sheep
Ovine meat is called lamb when from younger animals and mutton when from older ones in Commonwealth countries, and lamb in the United States (including from adults)|sheep
Sheep continue to be important for wool and meat today, and are also occasionally raised for pelts, as dairy animals, or as model organisms for science.|sheep
Sheep husbandry is practised throughout the majority of the inhabited world, and has been fundamental to many civilizations|sheep
In the modern era, Australia, New Zealand, the southern and central South American nations, and the British Isles are most closely associated with sheep production.|sheep
There is a large lexicon of unique terms for sheep husbandry which vary considerably by region and dialect|sheep
Use of the word sheep began in Middle English as a derivation of the Old English word scēap; it is both the singular and plural name for the animal|sheep
A group of sheep is called a flock|sheep
Many other specific terms for the various life stages of sheep exist, generally related to lambing, shearing, and age.|sheep
Being a key animal in the history of farming, sheep have a deeply entrenched place in human culture, and find representation in much modern language and symbology|sheep
As livestock, sheep are most often associated with pastoral, Arcadian imagery|sheep
Sheep figure in many mythologies—such as the Golden Fleece—and major religions, especially the Abrahamic traditions|sheep
In both ancient and modern religious ritual, sheep are used as sacrificial animals.|sheep
The exact line of descent between domestic sheep and their wild ancestors is unclear|sheep
The most common hypothesis states that Ovis aries is descended from the Asiatic (O|sheep
gmelini) species of mouflon; the European mouflon (Ovis aries musimon) is a direct descendant of this popuation|sheep
Sheep were among the first animals to be domesticated by humankind (although the domestication of dogs may have taken place more than 20,000 years earlier); the domestication date is estimated to fall between 11,000 and 9,000 B.C in Mesopotamia and possibly around 7,000 B.C|sheep
in Mehrgarh in the Indus Valley|sheep
The rearing of sheep for secondary products, and the resulting breed development, began in either southwest Asia or western Europe|sheep
Initially, sheep were kept solely for meat, milk and skins|sheep
Archaeological evidence from statuary found at sites in Iran suggests that selection for woolly sheep may have begun around 6000 BC, and the earliest woven wool garments have been dated to two to three thousand years later.Sheep husbandry spread quickly in  Europe|sheep
Excavations show that in about 6000 BC, during the Neolithic period of prehistory, the Castelnovien people, living around Châteauneuf-les-Martigues near present-day Marseille in the south of France, were among the first in Europe to keep domestic sheep|sheep
Practically from its inception, ancient Greek civilization relied on sheep as primary livestock, and were even said to name individual animals|sheep
Ancient Romans kept sheep on a wide scale, and were an important agent in the spread of sheep raising|sheep
Pliny the Elder, in his Natural History (Naturalis Historia), speaks at length about sheep and wool|sheep
European colonists spread the practice to the New World from 1493 onwards.|sheep
Domestic sheep are relatively small ruminants, usually with a crimped hair called wool and often with horns forming a lateral spiral|sheep
Domestic sheep differ from their wild relatives and ancestors in several respects, having become uniquely neotenic as a result of selective breeding by humans|sheep
A few primitive breeds of sheep retain some of the characteristics of their wild cousins, such as short tails|sheep
Depending on breed, domestic sheep may have no horns at all (i.e|sheep
polled), or horns in both sexes, or in males only|sheep
Most horned breeds have a single pair, but a few breeds may have several.|sheep
Another trait unique to domestic sheep as compared to wild ovines is their wide variation in color|sheep
Wild sheep are largely variations of brown hues, and variation within species is extremely limited|sheep
Colors of domestic sheep range from pure white to dark chocolate brown, and even spotted or piebald|sheep
Selection for easily dyeable white fleeces began early in sheep domestication, and as white wool is a dominant trait it spread quickly|sheep
However, colored sheep do appear in many modern breeds, and may even appear as a recessive trait in white flocks|sheep
While white wool is desirable for large commercial markets, there is a niche market for colored fleeces, mostly for handspinning|sheep
The nature of the fleece varies widely among the breeds, from dense and highly crimped, to long and hairlike|sheep
There is variation of wool type and quality even among members of the same flock, so wool classing is a step in the commercial processing of the fibre.|sheep
Depending on breed, sheep show a range of heights and weights|sheep
Their rate of growth and mature weight is a heritable trait that is often selected for in breeding|sheep
Ewes typically weigh between 45 and 100 kilograms (100 and 220 lb), and rams between 45 and 160 kilograms (100 and 350 lb)|sheep
When all deciduous teeth have erupted, the sheep has 20 teeth|sheep
Mature sheep have 32 teeth|sheep
As with other ruminants, the front teeth in the lower jaw bite against a hard, toothless pad in the upper jaw|sheep
These are used to pick off vegetation, then the rear teeth grind it before it is swallowed|sheep
There are eight lower front teeth in ruminants, but there is some disagreement as to whether these are eight incisors, or six incisors and two incisor-shaped canines|sheep
This means that the dental formula for sheep is either 0.0.3.34.0.3.3 or 0.0.3.33.1.3.3  There is a large diastema between the incisors and the molars.|sheep
In the first few years of life one can calculate the age of sheep from their front teeth, as a pair of milk teeth is replaced by larger adult teeth each year, the full set of eight adult front teeth being complete at about four years of age|sheep
The front teeth are then gradually lost as sheep age, making it harder for them to feed and hindering the health and productivity of the animal|sheep
For this reason, domestic sheep on normal pasture begin to slowly decline from four years on, and the life expectancy of a sheep is 10 to 12 years, though some sheep may live as long as 20 years|sheep
Sheep have good hearing, and are sensitive to noise when being handled|sheep
Sheep have horizontal slit-shaped pupils, with excellent peripheral vision; with visual fields of about 270° to 320°, sheep can see behind themselves without turning their heads|sheep
Many breeds have only short hair on the face, and some have facial wool (if any) confined to the poll and or the area of the mandibular angle; the wide angles of peripheral vision apply to these breeds|sheep
"A few breeds tend to have considerable wool on the face; for some individuals of these breeds, peripheral vision may be greatly reduced by ""wool blindness"", unless recently shorn about the face"|sheep
Sheep have poor depth perception; shadows and dips in the ground may cause sheep to baulk|sheep
In general, sheep have a tendency to move out of the dark and into well-lit areas, and prefer to move uphill when disturbed|sheep
Sheep also have an excellent sense of smell, and, like all species of their genus, have scent glands just in front of the eyes, and interdigitally on the feet|sheep
The purpose of these glands is uncertain, but those on the face may be used in breeding behaviors|sheep
The foot glands might also be related to reproduction, but alternative functions, such as secretion of a waste product or a scent marker to help lost sheep find their flock, have also been proposed.|sheep
Sheep and goats are closely related|sheep
both are in the subfamily Caprinae|sheep
However, they are separate species, so hybrids rarely occur and are always infertile|sheep
A hybrid of a ewe and a buck (a male goat) is called a sheep-goat hybrid, and is not to be confused with the sheep-goat chimera, though both are known as geep|sheep
Visual differences between sheep and goats include the beard of goats and divided upper lip of sheep|sheep
Sheep tails also hang down, even when short or docked, while the short tails of goats are held upwards|sheep
Also, sheep breeds are often naturally polled (either in both sexes or just in the female), while naturally polled goats are rare (though many are polled artificially)|sheep
Males of the two species differ in that buck goats acquire a unique and strong odor during the rut, whereas rams do not.|sheep
The domestic sheep is a multi-purpose animal, and the more than 200 breeds now in existence were created to serve these diverse purposes|sheep
Some sources give a count of a thousand or more breeds, but these numbers cannot be verified, according to some sources|sheep
However, several hundred breeds of sheep have been identified by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the UN (FAO), with the estimated number varying somewhat from time to time|sheep
e.g|sheep
863 breeds as of 1993, 1314 breeds as of 1995 and 1229 breeds as of 2006|sheep
"(These numbers exclude extinct breeds, which are also tallied by the FAO.) For the purpose of such tallies, the FAO definition of a breed is ""either a subspecific group of domestic livestock with definable and identifiable external characteristics that enable it to be separated by visual appraisal from other similarly defined groups within the same species or a group for which geographical and/or cultural separation from phenotypically similar groups has led to acceptance of its separate identity."" Almost all sheep are classified as being best suited to furnishing a certain product"|sheep
wool, meat, milk, hides, or a combination in a dual-purpose breed|sheep
Other features used when classifying sheep include face color (generally white or black), tail length, presence or lack of horns, and the topography for which the breed has been developed|sheep
This last point is especially stressed in the UK, where breeds are described as either upland (hill or mountain) or lowland breeds|sheep
A sheep may also be of a fat-tailed type, which is a dual-purpose sheep common in Africa and Asia with larger deposits of fat within and around its tail.|sheep
Breeds are often categorized by the type of their wool|sheep
Fine wool breeds are those that have wool of great crimp and density, which are preferred for textiles|sheep
Most of these were derived from Merino sheep, and the breed continues to dominate the world sheep industry|sheep
Downs breeds have wool between the extremes, and are typically fast-growing meat and ram breeds with dark faces|sheep
Some major medium wool breeds, such as the Corriedale, are dual-purpose crosses of long and fine-wooled breeds and were created for high-production commercial flocks|sheep
Long wool breeds are the largest of sheep, with long wool and a slow rate of growth|sheep
Long wool sheep are most valued for crossbreeding to improve the attributes of other sheep types|sheep
For example|sheep
the American Columbia breed was developed by crossing Lincoln rams (a long wool breed) with fine-wooled Rambouillet ewes.|sheep
Coarse or carpet wool sheep are those with a medium to long length wool of characteristic coarseness|sheep
Breeds traditionally used for carpet wool show great variability, but the chief requirement is a wool that will not break down under heavy use (as would that of the finer breeds)|sheep
As the demand for carpet-quality wool declines, some breeders of this type of sheep are attempting to use a few of these traditional breeds for alternative purposes|sheep
Others have always been primarily meat-class sheep.|sheep
A minor class of sheep are the dairy breeds|sheep
Dual-purpose breeds that may primarily be meat or wool sheep are often used secondarily as milking animals, but there are a few breeds that are predominantly used for milking|sheep
These sheep produce a higher quantity of milk and have slightly longer lactation curves|sheep
In the quality of their milk, the fat and protein content percentages of dairy sheep vary from non-dairy breeds, but lactose content does not.A last group of sheep breeds is that of fur or hair sheep, which do not grow wool at all|sheep
Hair sheep are similar to the early domesticated sheep kept before woolly breeds were developed, and are raised for meat and pelts|sheep
Some modern breeds of hair sheep, such as the Dorper, result from crosses between wool and hair breeds|sheep
For meat and hide producers, hair sheep are cheaper to keep, as they do not need shearing|sheep
Hair sheep are also more resistant to parasites and hot weather.With the modern rise of corporate agribusiness and the decline of localized family farms, many breeds of sheep are in danger of extinction|sheep
"The Rare Breeds Survival Trust of the UK lists 22 native breeds as having only 3,000 registered animals (each), and The Livestock Conservancy lists 14 as either ""critical"" or ""threatened"""|sheep
Preferences for breeds with uniform characteristics and fast growth have pushed heritage (or heirloom) breeds to the margins of the sheep industry|sheep
Those that remain are maintained through the efforts of conservation organizations, breed registries, and individual farmers dedicated to their preservation.|sheep
Sheep are herbivorous mammals|sheep
Most breeds prefer to graze on grass and other short roughage, avoiding the taller woody parts of plants that goats readily consume|sheep
Both sheep and goats use their lips and tongues to select parts of the plant that are easier to digest or higher in nutrition|sheep
Sheep, however, graze well in monoculture pastures where most goats fare poorly.|sheep
Like all ruminants, sheep have a complex digestive system composed of four chambers, allowing them to break down cellulose from stems, leaves, and seed hulls into simpler carbohydrates|sheep
When sheep graze, vegetation is chewed into a mass called a bolus, which is then passed into the rumen, via the reticulum|sheep
The rumen is a 19- to 38-liter (5 to 10 gallon) organ in which feed is fermented|sheep
The fermenting organisms include bacteria, fungi, and protozoa|sheep
(Other important rumen organisms include some archaea, which produce methane from carbon dioxide.) The bolus is periodically regurgitated back to the mouth as cud for additional chewing and salivation|sheep
After fermentation in the rumen, feed passes into the reticulum and the omasum; special feeds such as grains may bypass the rumen altogether|sheep
After the first three chambers, food moves into the abomasum for final digestion before processing by the intestines|sheep
"The abomasum is the only one of the four chambers analogous to the human stomach, and is sometimes called the ""true stomach"".Other than forage, the other staple feed for sheep is hay, often during the winter months"|sheep
The ability to thrive solely on pasture (even without hay) varies with breed, but all sheep can survive on this diet|sheep
Also included in some sheep's diets are minerals, either in a trace mix or in licks|sheep
Feed provided to sheep must be specially formulated, as most cattle, poultry, pig, and even some goat feeds contain levels of copper that are lethal to sheep|sheep
The same danger applies to mineral supplements such as salt licks.|sheep
Sheep follow a diurnal pattern of activity, feeding from dawn to dusk, stopping sporadically to rest and chew their cud|sheep
Ideal pasture for sheep is not lawnlike grass, but an array of grasses, legumes and forbs|sheep
Types of land where sheep are raised vary widely, from pastures that are seeded and improved intentionally to rough, native lands|sheep
Common plants toxic to sheep are present in most of the world, and include (but are not limited to) cherry, some oaks and acorns, tomato, yew, rhubarb, potato, and rhododendron.|sheep
Sheep are largely grazing herbivores, unlike browsing animals such as goats and deer that prefer taller foliage|sheep
With a much narrower face, sheep crop plants very close to the ground and can overgraze a pasture much faster than cattle|sheep
For this reason, many shepherds use managed intensive rotational grazing, where a flock is rotated through multiple pastures, giving plants time to recover|sheep
Paradoxically, sheep can both cause and solve the spread of invasive plant species|sheep
By disturbing the natural state of pasture, sheep and other livestock can pave the way for invasive plants|sheep
However, sheep also prefer to eat invasives such as cheatgrass, leafy spurge, kudzu and spotted knapweed over native species such as sagebrush, making grazing sheep effective for conservation grazing|sheep
Research conducted in Imperial County, California compared lamb grazing with herbicides for weed control in seedling alfalfa fields|sheep
Three trials demonstrated that grazing lambs were just as effective as herbicides in controlling winter weeds|sheep
Entomologists also compared grazing lambs to insecticides for insect control in winter alfalfa|sheep
In this trial, lambs provided insect control as effectively as insecticides.|sheep
Sheep are flock animals and strongly gregarious; much sheep behavior can be understood on the basis of these tendencies|sheep
The dominance hierarchy of sheep and their natural inclination to follow a leader to new pastures were the pivotal factors in sheep being one of the first domesticated livestock species|sheep
Furthermore, in contrast to the red deer and gazelle (two other ungulates of primary importance to meat production in prehistoric times), sheep do not defend territories although they do form home ranges|sheep
All sheep have a tendency to congregate close to other members of a flock, although this behavior varies with breed, and sheep can become stressed when separated from their flock members|sheep
During flocking, sheep have a strong tendency to follow, and a leader may simply be the first individual to move|sheep
Relationships in flocks tend to be closest among related sheep|sheep
in mixed-breed flocks, subgroups of the same breed tend to form, and a ewe and her direct descendants often move as a unit within large flocks|sheep
Sheep can become hefted to one particular local pasture (heft) so they do not roam freely in unfenced landscapes|sheep
Lambs learn the heft from ewes and if whole flocks are culled it must be retaught to the replacement animals.Flock behaviour in sheep is generally only exhibited in groups of four or more sheep; fewer sheep may not react as expected when alone or with few other sheep|sheep
Being a prey species, the primary defense mechanism of sheep is to flee from danger when their flight zone is entered|sheep
Cornered sheep may charge and butt, or threaten by hoof stamping and adopting an aggressive posture|sheep
This is particularly true for ewes with newborn lambs.In regions where sheep have no natural predators, none of the native breeds of sheep exhibit a strong flocking behavior.|sheep
Farmers exploit flocking behavior to keep sheep together on unfenced pastures such as hill farming, and to move them more easily|sheep
For this purpose shepherds may use herding dogs in this effort, with a highly bred herding ability|sheep
Sheep are food-oriented, and association of humans with regular feeding often results in sheep soliciting people for food|sheep
Those who are moving sheep may exploit this behavior by leading sheep with buckets of feed.|sheep
Sheep establish a dominance hierarchy through fighting, threats and competitiveness|sheep
Dominant animals are inclined to be more aggressive with other sheep, and usually feed first at troughs|sheep
Primarily among rams, horn size is a factor in the flock hierarchy|sheep
Rams with different size horns may be less inclined to fight to establish the dominance order, while rams with similarly sized horns are more so|sheep
Merinos have an almost linear hierarchy whereas there is a less rigid structure in Border Leicesters when a competitive feeding situation arises.In sheep, position in a moving flock is highly correlated with social dominance, but there is no definitive study to show consistent voluntary leadership by an individual sheep.|sheep
Sheep are frequently thought of as unintelligent animals|sheep
Their flocking behavior and quickness to flee and panic can make shepherding a difficult endeavor for the uninitiated|sheep
Despite these perceptions, a University of Illinois monograph on sheep reported their intelligence to be just below that of pigs and on par with that of cattle.|sheep
Sheep can recognize individual human and ovine faces and remember them for years|sheep
In addition to long-term facial recognition of individuals, sheep can also differentiate emotional states through facial characteristics|sheep
If worked with patiently, sheep may learn their names, and many sheep are trained to be led by halter for showing and other purposes|sheep
Sheep have also responded well to clicker training|sheep
Sheep have been used as pack animals; Tibetan nomads distribute baggage equally throughout a flock as it is herded between living sites.It has been reported that some sheep have apparently shown problem-solving abilities; a flock in West Yorkshire, England allegedly found a way to get over cattle grids by rolling on their backs, although documentation of this has relied on anecdotal accounts.|sheep
Sounds made by domestic sheep include bleats, grunts, rumbles and snorts|sheep
"Bleating (""baaing"") is used mostly for contact communication, especially between dam and lambs, but also at times between other flock members"|sheep
The bleats of individual sheep are distinctive, enabling the ewe and her lambs to recognize each other's vocalizations|sheep
Vocal communication between lambs and their dam declines to a very low level within several weeks after parturition|sheep
A variety of bleats may be heard, depending on sheep age and circumstances|sheep
Apart from contact communication, bleating may signal distress, frustration or impatience; however, sheep are usually silent when in pain|sheep
Isolation commonly prompts bleating by sheep|sheep
Pregnant ewes may grunt when in labor|sheep
Rumbling sounds are made by the ram during courting; somewhat similar rumbling sounds may be made by the ewe, especially when with her neonate lambs|sheep
A snort (explosive exhalation through the nostrils) may signal aggression or a warning, and is often elicited from startled sheep.|sheep
In sheep breeds lacking facial wool, the visual field is wide|sheep
In 10 sheep (Cambridge, Lleyn and Welsh Mountain breeds, which lack facial wool), the visual field ranged from 298° to 325°, averaging 313.1°, with binocular overlap ranging from 44.5° to 74°, averaging 61.7°|sheep
"In some breeds, unshorn facial wool can limit the visual field; in some individuals, this may be enough to cause ""wool blindness"""|sheep
In 60 Merinos, visual fields ranged from 219.1° to 303.0°, averaging 269.9°, and the binocular field ranged from 8.9° to 77.7°, averaging 47.5°; 36% of the measurements were limited by wool, although photographs of the experiments indicate that only limited facial wool regrowth had occurred since shearing|sheep
In addition to facial wool (in some breeds), visual field limitations can include ears and (in some breeds) horns, so the visual field can be extended by tilting the head|sheep
Sheep eyes exhibit very low hyperopia and little astigmatism|sheep
Such visual characteristics are likely to produce a well-focused retinal image of objects in both the middle and long distance|sheep
Because sheep eyes have no accommodation, one might expect the image of very near objects to be blurred, but a rather clear near image could be provided by the tapetum and large retinal image of the sheep's eye, and adequate close vision may occur at muzzle length|sheep
"Good depth perception, inferred from the sheep's sure-footedness, was confirmed in ""visual cliff"" experiments; behavioral responses indicating depth perception are seen in lambs at one day old"|sheep
Sheep are thought to have colour vision, and can distinguish between a variety of colours|sheep
black, red, brown, green, yellow and white|sheep
Sight is a vital part of sheep communication, and when grazing, they maintain visual contact with each other|sheep
Each sheep lifts its head upwards to check the position of other sheep in the flock|sheep
This constant monitoring is probably what keeps the sheep in a flock as they move along grazing|sheep
Sheep become stressed when isolated; this stress is reduced if they are provided with a mirror, indicating that the sight of other sheep reduces stress.Taste is the most important sense in sheep, establishing forage preferences, with sweet and sour plants being preferred and bitter plants being more commonly rejected|sheep
Touch and sight are also important in relation to specific plant characteristics, such as succulence and growth form.The ram uses his vomeronasal organ (sometimes called the Jacobson's organ) to sense the pheromones of ewes and detect when they are in estrus|sheep
The ewe uses her vomeronasal organ for early recognition of her neonate lamb.|sheep
Sheep follow a similar reproductive strategy to other herd animals|sheep
A group of ewes is generally mated by a single ram, who has either been chosen by a breeder or (in feral populations) has established dominance through physical contest with other rams|sheep
Most sheep are seasonal breeders, although some are able to breed year-round|sheep
Ewes generally reach sexual maturity at six to eight months old, and rams generally at four to six months|sheep
However, there are exceptions|sheep
For example, Finnsheep ewe lambs may reach puberty as early as 3 to 4 months, and Merino ewes sometimes reach puberty at 18 to 20 months|sheep
Ewes have estrus cycles about every 17 days, during which they emit a scent and indicate readiness through physical displays towards rams|sheep
A minority of rams (8% on average) display a preference for homosexuality and a small number of the females that were accompanied by a male fetus in utero are freemartins (female animals that are behaviorally masculine and lack functioning ovaries).In feral sheep, rams may fight during the rut to determine which individuals may mate with ewes|sheep
Rams, especially unfamiliar ones, will also fight outside the breeding period to establish dominance; rams can kill one another if allowed to mix freely|sheep
During the rut, even usually friendly rams may become aggressive towards humans due to increases in their hormone levels.After mating, sheep have a gestation period of about five months, and normal labor takes one to three hours|sheep
Although some breeds regularly throw larger litters of lambs, most produce single or twin lambs|sheep
During or soon after labor, ewes and lambs may be confined to small lambing jugs, small pens designed to aid both careful observation of ewes and to cement the bond between them and their lambs.|sheep
Ovine obstetrics can be problematic|sheep
By selectively breeding ewes that produce multiple offspring with higher birth weights for generations, sheep producers have inadvertently caused some domestic sheep to have difficulty lambing; balancing ease of lambing with high productivity is one of the dilemmas of sheep breeding|sheep
In the case of any such problems, those present at lambing may assist the ewe by extracting or repositioning lambs|sheep
After the birth, ewes ideally break the amniotic sac (if it is not broken during labor), and begin licking clean the lamb|sheep
Most lambs will begin standing within an hour of birth|sheep
In normal situations, lambs nurse after standing, receiving vital colostrum milk|sheep
Lambs that either fail to nurse or are rejected by the ewe require help to survive, such as bottle-feeding or fostering by another ewe.Most lambs begin life being born outdoors|sheep
After lambs are several weeks old, lamb marking (ear tagging, docking, mulesing, and castrating) is carried out|sheep
Vaccinations are usually carried out at this point as well|sheep
Ear tags with numbers are attached, or ear marks are applied, for ease of later identification of sheep|sheep
Docking and castration are commonly done after 24 hours (to avoid interference with maternal bonding and consumption of colostrum) and are often done not later than one week after birth, to minimize pain, stress, recovery time and complications|sheep
The first course of vaccinations (commonly anti-clostridial) is commonly given at an age of about 10 to 12 weeks; i.e|sheep
when the concentration of maternal antibodies passively acquired via colostrum is expected to have fallen low enough to permit development of active immunity|sheep
Ewes are often revaccinated annually about 3 weeks before lambing, to provide high antibody concentrations in colostrum during the first several hours after lambing|sheep
Ram lambs that will either be slaughtered or separated from ewes before sexual maturity are not usually castrated|sheep
Objections to all these procedures have been raised by animal rights groups, but farmers defend them by saying they save money, and inflict only temporary pain.|sheep
Sheep may fall victim to poisons, infectious diseases, and physical injuries|sheep
As a prey species, a sheep's system is adapted to hide the obvious signs of illness, to prevent being targeted by predators|sheep
However, some signs of ill health are obvious, with sick sheep eating little, vocalizing excessively, and being generally listless|sheep
Throughout history, much of the money and labor of sheep husbandry has aimed to prevent sheep ailments|sheep
Historically, shepherds often created remedies by experimentation on the farm|sheep
In some developed countries, including the United States, sheep lack the economic importance for drug companies to perform expensive clinical trials required to approve more than a relatively limited number of drugs for ovine use|sheep
However, extra-label drug use in sheep production is permitted in many jurisdictions, subject to certain restrictions|sheep
In the US, for example, regulations governing extra-label drug use in animals are found in 21 CFR (Code of Federal Regulations) Part 530|sheep
In the 20th and 21st centuries, a minority of sheep owners have turned to alternative treatments such as homeopathy, herbalism and even traditional Chinese medicine to treat sheep veterinary problems|sheep
Despite some favorable anecdotal evidence, the effectiveness of alternative veterinary medicine has been met with skepticism in scientific journals|sheep
The need for traditional anti-parasite drugs and antibiotics is widespread, and is the main impediment to certified organic farming with sheep.Many breeders take a variety of preventive measures to ward off problems|sheep
The first is to ensure all sheep are healthy when purchased|sheep
Many buyers avoid outlets known to be clearing houses for animals culled from healthy flocks as either sick or simply inferior|sheep
This can also mean maintaining a closed flock, and quarantining new sheep for a month|sheep
Two fundamental preventive programs are maintaining good nutrition and reducing stress in the sheep|sheep
Restraint, isolation, loud noises, novel situations, pain, heat, extreme cold, fatigue and other stressors can lead to secretion of cortisol, a stress hormone, in amounts that may indicate welfare problems|sheep
Excessive stress can compromise the immune system|sheep
"""Shipping fever"" (pneumonic mannheimiosis, formerly called pasteurellosis) is a disease of particular concern, that can occur as a result of stress, notably during transport and (or) handling"|sheep
Pain, fear and several other stressors can cause secretion of epinephrine (adrenaline)|sheep
Considerable epinephrine secretion in the final days before slaughter can adversely affect meat quality (by causing glycogenolysis, removing the substrate for normal post-slaughter acidification of meat) and result in meat becoming more susceptible to colonization by spoilage bacteria|sheep
Because of such issues, low-stress handling is essential in sheep management|sheep
Avoiding poisoning is also important; common poisons are pesticide sprays, inorganic fertilizer, motor oil, as well as radiator coolant containing ethylene glycol.|sheep
Common forms of preventive medication for sheep are vaccinations and treatments for parasites|sheep
Both external and internal parasites are the most prevalent malady in sheep, and are either fatal, or reduce the productivity of flocks|sheep
Worms are the most common internal parasites|sheep
They are ingested during grazing, incubate within the sheep, and are expelled through the digestive system (beginning the cycle again)|sheep
Oral anti-parasitic medicines, known as drenches, are given to a flock to treat worms, sometimes after worm eggs in the feces has been counted to assess infestation levels|sheep
Afterwards, sheep may be moved to a new pasture to avoid ingesting the same parasites|sheep
External sheep parasites include|sheep
lice (for different parts of the body), sheep keds, nose bots, sheep itch mites, and maggots|sheep
Keds are blood-sucking parasites that cause general malnutrition and decreased productivity, but are not fatal|sheep
Maggots are those of the bot fly and the blow-fly, commonly Lucilia sericata or its relative L|sheep
cuprina|sheep
Fly maggots cause the extremely destructive condition of flystrike|sheep
Flies lay their eggs in wounds or wet, manure-soiled wool; when the maggots hatch they burrow into a sheep's flesh, eventually causing death if untreated|sheep
In addition to other treatments, crutching (shearing wool from a sheep's rump) is a common preventive method|sheep
Some countries allow mulesing, a practice that involves stripping away the skin on the rump to prevent fly-strike, normally performed when the sheep is a lamb|sheep
Nose bots are fly larvae that inhabit a sheep's sinuses, causing breathing difficulties and discomfort|sheep
Common signs are a discharge from the nasal passage, sneezing, and frantic movement such as head shaking|sheep
External parasites may be controlled through the use of backliners, sprays or immersive sheep dips.A wide array of bacterial and viral diseases affect sheep|sheep
Diseases of the hoof, such as foot rot and foot scald may occur, and are treated with footbaths and other remedies|sheep
Foot rot is present in over 97% of flocks in the UK|sheep
These painful conditions cause lameness and hinder feeding|sheep
Ovine Johne's disease is a wasting disease that affects young sheep|sheep
Bluetongue disease is an insect-borne illness causing fever and inflammation of the mucous membranes|sheep
Ovine rinderpest (or peste des petits ruminants) is a highly contagious and often fatal viral disease affecting sheep and goats|sheep
Sheep may also be affected by primary or secondary photosensitization|sheep
Tetanus can also afflict sheep through wounds from shearing, docking, castration, or vaccination|sheep
The organism also can be introduced into the reproductive tract by unsanitary humans who assist ewes during lambing.A few sheep conditions are transmissible to humans|sheep
Orf (also known as scabby mouth, contagious ecthyma or soremouth) is a skin disease leaving lesions that is transmitted through skin-to-skin contact|sheep
Cutaneous anthrax is also called woolsorter's disease, as the spores can be transmitted in unwashed wool|sheep
More seriously, the organisms that can cause spontaneous enzootic abortion in sheep are easily transmitted to pregnant women|sheep
Also of concern are the prion disease scrapie and the virus that causes foot-and-mouth disease (FMD), as both can devastate flocks|sheep
The latter poses a slight risk to humans|sheep
During the 2001 FMD pandemic in the UK, hundreds of sheep were culled and some rare British breeds were at risk of extinction due to this.Of the 600,300 sheep lost to the US economy in 2004, 37.3% were lost to predators, while 26.5% were lost to some form of disease|sheep
Poisoning accounted for 1.7% of non-productive deaths.|sheep
Other than parasites and disease, predation is a threat to sheep and the profitability of sheep raising|sheep
Sheep have little ability to defend themselves, compared with other species kept as livestock|sheep
Even if sheep survive an attack, they may die from their injuries or simply from panic|sheep
However, the impact of predation varies dramatically with region|sheep
In Africa, Australia, the Americas, and parts of Europe and Asia predators are a serious problem|sheep
In the United States, for instance, over one third of sheep deaths in 2004 were caused by predation|sheep
In contrast, other nations are virtually devoid of sheep predators, particularly islands known for extensive sheep husbandry|sheep
Worldwide, canids—including the domestic dog—are responsible for most sheep deaths|sheep
Other animals that occasionally prey on sheep include|sheep
felines, bears, birds of prey, ravens and feral hogs.Sheep producers have used a wide variety of measures to combat predation|sheep
Pre-modern shepherds used their own presence, livestock guardian dogs, and protective structures such as barns and fencing|sheep
Fencing (both regular and electric), penning sheep at night and lambing indoors all continue to be widely used|sheep
More modern shepherds used guns, traps, and poisons to kill predators, causing significant decreases in predator populations|sheep
In the wake of the environmental and conservation movements, the use of these methods now usually falls under the purview of specially designated government agencies in most developed countries.The 1970s saw a resurgence in the use of livestock guardian dogs and the development of new methods of predator control by sheep producers, many of them non-lethal|sheep
Donkeys and guard llamas have been used since the 1980s in sheep operations, using the same basic principle as livestock guardian dogs|sheep
Interspecific pasturing, usually with larger livestock such as cattle or horses, may help to deter predators, even if such species do not actively guard sheep|sheep
In addition to animal guardians, contemporary sheep operations may use non-lethal predator deterrents such as motion-activated lights and noisy alarms.|sheep
Sheep are an important part of the global agricultural economy|sheep
However, their once vital status has been largely replaced by other livestock species, especially the pig, chicken, and cow|sheep
China, Australia, India, and Iran have the largest modern flocks, and serve both local and exportation needs for wool and mutton|sheep
Other countries such as New Zealand have smaller flocks but retain a large international economic impact due to their export of sheep products|sheep
Sheep also play a major role in many local economies, which may be niche markets focused on organic or sustainable agriculture and local food customers|sheep
Especially in developing countries, such flocks may be a part of subsistence agriculture rather than a system of trade|sheep
Sheep themselves may be a medium of trade in barter economies.|sheep
Domestic sheep provide a wide array of raw materials|sheep
Wool was one of the first textiles, although in the late 20th century wool prices began to fall dramatically as the result of the popularity and cheap prices for synthetic fabrics|sheep
For many sheep owners, the cost of shearing is greater than the possible profit from the fleece, making subsisting on wool production alone practically impossible without farm subsidies|sheep
Fleeces are used as material in making alternative products such as wool insulation|sheep
In the 21st century, the sale of meat is the most profitable enterprise in the sheep industry, even though far less sheep meat is consumed than chicken, pork or beef.Sheepskin is likewise used for making clothes, footwear, rugs, and other products|sheep
Byproducts from the slaughter of sheep are also of value|sheep
sheep tallow can be used in candle and soap making, sheep bone and cartilage has been used to furnish carved items such as dice and buttons as well as rendered glue and gelatin|sheep
Sheep intestine can be formed into sausage casings, and lamb intestine has been formed into surgical sutures, as well as strings for musical instruments and tennis rackets|sheep
Sheep droppings, which are high in cellulose, have even been sterilized and mixed with traditional pulp materials to make paper|sheep
Of all sheep byproducts, perhaps the most valuable is lanolin|sheep
the waterproof, fatty substance found naturally in sheep's wool and used as a base for innumerable cosmetics and other products.|sheep
Some farmers who keep sheep also make a profit from live sheep|sheep
Providing lambs for youth programs such as 4-H and competition at agricultural shows is often a dependable avenue for the sale of sheep|sheep
Farmers may also choose to focus on a particular breed of sheep in order to sell registered purebred animals, as well as provide a ram rental service for breeding|sheep
"A new option for deriving profit from live sheep is the rental of flocks for grazing; these ""mowing services"" are hired in order to keep unwanted vegetation down in public spaces and to lessen fire hazard.Despite the falling demand and price for sheep products in many markets, sheep have distinct economic advantages when compared with other livestock"|sheep
They do not require expensive housing, such as that used in the intensive farming of chickens or pigs|sheep
They are an efficient use of land; roughly six sheep can be kept on the amount that would suffice for a single cow or horse|sheep
Sheep can also consume plants, such as noxious weeds, that most other animals will not touch, and produce more young at a faster rate|sheep
Also, in contrast to most livestock species, the cost of raising sheep is not necessarily tied to the price of feed crops such as grain, soybeans and corn|sheep
Combined with the  lower cost of quality sheep, all these factors combine to equal a lower overhead for sheep producers, thus entailing a higher profitability potential for the small farmer|sheep
Sheep are especially beneficial for independent producers, including family farms with limited resources, as the sheep industry is one of the few types of animal agriculture that has not been vertically integrated by agribusiness|sheep
However, small flocks, from 10 to 50 ewes, often are not profitable because they tend to be poorly managed|sheep
The primary reason is that mechanization is not feasible, so return per hour of labor is not maximized|sheep
Small farm flocks generally are used simply to control weeds on irrigation ditches or maintained as a hobby.|sheep
Sheep meat and milk were one of the earliest staple proteins consumed by human civilization after the transition from hunting and gathering to agriculture|sheep
Sheep meat prepared for food is known as either mutton or lamb, and approximately 540 million sheep are slaughtered each year for meat worldwide|sheep
"""Mutton"" is derived from the Old French moton, which was the word for sheep used by the Anglo-Norman rulers of much of the British Isles in the Middle Ages"|sheep
This became the name for sheep meat in English, while the Old English word sceap was kept for the live animal|sheep
"Throughout modern history, ""mutton"" has been limited to the meat of mature sheep usually at least two years of age; ""lamb"" is used for that of immature sheep less than a year.In the 21st century, the nations with the highest consumption of sheep meat are the Arab States of the Persian Gulf, New Zealand, Australia, Greece, Uruguay, the United Kingdom and Ireland"|sheep
These countries eat 14–40 lbs (3–18 kg) of sheep meat per capita, per annum|sheep
Sheep meat is also popular in France, Africa (especially the Arab World), the Caribbean, the rest of the Middle East, India, and parts of China|sheep
This often reflects a history of sheep production|sheep
In these countries in particular, dishes comprising alternative cuts and offal may be popular or traditional|sheep
Sheep testicles—called animelles or lamb fries—are considered a delicacy in many parts of the world|sheep
Perhaps the most unusual dish of sheep meat is the Scottish haggis, composed of various sheep innards cooked along with oatmeal and chopped onions inside its stomach|sheep
In comparison, countries such as the U.S|sheep
consume only a pound or less (under 0.5 kg), with Americans eating 50 pounds (22 kg) of pork and 65 pounds (29 kg) of beef|sheep
In addition, such countries rarely eat mutton, and may favor the more expensive cuts of lamb|sheep
mostly lamb chops and leg of lamb.Though sheep's milk may be drunk rarely in fresh form, today it is used predominantly in cheese and yogurt making|sheep
Sheep have only two teats, and produce a far smaller volume of milk than cows|sheep
However, as sheep's milk contains far more fat, solids, and minerals than cow's milk, it is ideal for the cheese-making process|sheep
It also resists contamination during cooling better because of its much higher calcium content|sheep
Well-known cheeses made from sheep milk include the Feta of Bulgaria and Greece, Roquefort of France, Manchego from Spain, the Pecorino Romano (the Italian word for sheep is pecore) and Ricotta of Italy|sheep
Yogurts, especially some forms of strained yogurt, may also be made from sheep milk|sheep
Many of these products are now often made with cow's milk, especially when produced outside their country of origin|sheep
Sheep milk contains 4.8% lactose, which may affect those who are intolerant.As with other domestic animals, the meat of uncastrated males is inferior in quality, especially as they grow|sheep
"A ""bucky"" lamb is a lamb which was not castrated early enough, or which was castrated improperly (resulting in one testicle being retained)"|sheep
These lambs are worth less at market.|sheep
Sheep are generally too large and reproduce too slowly to make ideal research subjects, and thus are not a common model organism|sheep
They have, however, played an influential role in some fields of science|sheep
In particular, the Roslin Institute of Edinburgh, Scotland used sheep for genetics research that produced groundbreaking results|sheep
In 1995, two ewes named Megan and Morag were the first mammals cloned from differentiated cells|sheep
"A year later, a Finnish Dorset sheep named Dolly, dubbed ""the world's most famous sheep"" in Scientific American, was the first mammal to be cloned from an adult somatic cell"|sheep
Following this, Polly and Molly were the first mammals to be simultaneously cloned and transgenic.|sheep
As of 2008, the sheep genome has not been fully sequenced, although a detailed genetic map has been published, and a draft version of the complete genome produced by assembling sheep DNA sequences using information given by the genomes of other mammals|sheep
"In 2012, a transgenic sheep named ""Peng Peng"" was cloned by Chinese scientists, who spliced his genes with that of a roundworm (C"|sheep
elegans) in order to increase production of fats healthier for human consumption.In the study of natural selection, the population of Soay sheep that remain on the island of Hirta have been used to explore the relation of body size and coloration to reproductive success|sheep
Soay sheep come in several colors, and researchers investigated why the larger, darker sheep were in decline; this occurrence contradicted the rule of thumb that larger members of a population tend to be more successful reproductively|sheep
The feral Soays on Hirta are especially useful subjects because they are isolated.Sheep are one of the few animals where the molecular basis of the diversity of male sexual preferences has been examined|sheep
However, this research has been controversial, and much publicity has been produced by a study at the Oregon Health and Science University that investigated the mechanisms that produce homosexuality in rams|sheep
Organizations such as PETA campaigned against the study, accusing scientists of trying to cure homosexuality in the sheep|sheep
OHSU and the involved scientists vehemently denied such accusations.Domestic sheep are sometimes used in medical research, particularly for researching cardiovascular physiology, in areas such as hypertension and heart failure|sheep
Pregnant sheep are also a useful model for human pregnancy, and have been used to investigate the effects on fetal development of malnutrition and hypoxia|sheep
In behavioral sciences, sheep have been used in isolated cases for the study of facial recognition, as their mental process of recognition is qualitatively similar to humans.|sheep
Sheep have had a strong presence in many cultures, especially in areas where they form the most common type of livestock|sheep
In the English language, to call someone a sheep or ovine may allude that they are timid and easily led|sheep
In contradiction to this image, male sheep are often used as symbols of virility and power; the logos of the Los Angeles Rams football team and the Dodge Ram pickup truck allude to males of the bighorn sheep, Ovis canadensis.|sheep
Counting sheep is popularly said to be an aid to sleep, and some ancient systems of counting sheep persist today|sheep
"Sheep also enter in colloquial sayings and idiom frequently with such phrases as ""black sheep"""|sheep
To call an individual a black sheep implies that they are an odd or disreputable member of a group|sheep
This usage derives from the recessive trait that causes an occasional black lamb to be born into an entirely white flock|sheep
These black sheep were considered undesirable by shepherds, as black wool is not as commercially viable as white wool|sheep
Citizens who accept overbearing governments have been referred to by the Portmanteau neologism of sheeple|sheep
"Somewhat differently, the adjective ""sheepish"" is also used to describe embarrassment."|sheep
In British heraldry, sheep appear in the form of rams, sheep proper and lambs|sheep
These are distinguished by the ram being depicted with horns and a tail, the sheep with neither and the lamb with its tail only|sheep
A further variant of the lamb, termed the Paschal lamb, is depicted as carrying a Christian cross and with a halo over its head|sheep
Rams' heads, portrayed without a neck and facing the viewer, are also found in British armories|sheep
The fleece, depicted as an entire sheepskin carried by a ring around its midsection, originally became known through its use in the arms of the Order of the Golden Fleece and was later adopted by towns and individuals with connections to the wool industry.|sheep
In antiquity, symbolism involving sheep cropped up in religions in the ancient Near East, the Mideast, and the Mediterranean area|sheep
Çatalhöyük, ancient Egyptian religion, the Cana'anite and Phoenician tradition, Judaism, Greek religion, and others|sheep
Religious symbolism and ritual involving sheep began with some of the first known faiths|sheep
Skulls of rams (along with bulls) occupied central placement in shrines at the Çatalhöyük settlement in 8,000 BCE|sheep
In Ancient Egyptian religion, the ram was the symbol of several gods|sheep
Khnum, Heryshaf and Amun (in his incarnation as a god of fertility)|sheep
Other deities occasionally shown with ram features include the goddess Ishtar, the Phoenician god Baal-Hamon, and the Babylonian god Ea-Oannes|sheep
In Madagascar, sheep were not eaten as they were believed to be incarnations of the souls of ancestors.There are many ancient Greek references to sheep|sheep
that of Chrysomallos, the golden-fleeced ram, continuing to be told through into the modern era|sheep
Astrologically, Aries, the ram, is the first sign of the classical Greek zodiac, and the sheep is the eighth of the twelve animals associated with the 12-year cycle of in the Chinese zodiac, related to the Chinese calendar|sheep
In Mongolia, shagai are an ancient form of dice made from the cuboid bones of sheep that are often used for fortunetelling purposes.|sheep
Sheep play an important role in all the Abrahamic faiths; Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, Moses, King David and the Islamic prophet Muhammad were all shepherds|sheep
According to the Biblical story of the Binding of Isaac, a ram is sacrificed as a substitute for Isaac after an angel stays Abraham's hand (in the Islamic tradition, Abraham was about to sacrifice Ishmael)|sheep
Eid al-Adha is a major annual festival in Islam in which sheep (or other animals) are sacrificed in remembrance of this act|sheep
Sheep are occasionally sacrificed to commemorate important secular events in Islamic cultures|sheep
Greeks and Romans sacrificed sheep regularly in religious practice, and Judaism once sacrificed sheep as a Korban (sacrifice), such as the Passover lamb|sheep
Ovine symbols—such as the ceremonial blowing of a shofar—still find a presence in modern Judaic traditions.|sheep
Collectively, followers of Christianity are often referred to as a flock, with Christ as the Good Shepherd, and sheep are an element in the Christian iconography of the birth of Jesus|sheep
Some Christian saints are considered patrons of shepherds, and even of sheep themselves|sheep
Christ is also portrayed as the Sacrificial lamb of God (Agnus Dei) and Easter celebrations in Greece and Romania traditionally feature a meal of Paschal lamb|sheep
A church leader is often called the pastor, which is derived from the Latin word for shepherd|sheep
In many western Christian traditions bishops carry a staff, which also serves as a symbol of the episcopal office, known as a crosier, which is modeled on the shepherd's crook.|sheep

Encyclopædia Britannica (11th ed.)|sheep
1911.|sheep
Monkey is a common name that may refer to most mammals of the infraorder Simiiformes, also known as the simians|monkey
Traditionally, all animals in the group now known as simians are counted as monkeys except the apes, a grouping known as paraphyletic; however in the broader sense based on cladistics, apes (Hominoidea) are also included, making the terms monkeys and simians synonyms in regard of their scope|monkey
Monkeys are divided into the families of New World monkeys (Platyrrhini) and Old World monkeys (Cercopithecidae in the strict sense; Catarrhini in the broad sense, which again includes apes)|monkey
Many monkey species are tree-dwelling (arboreal), although there are species that live primarily on the ground, such as baboons|monkey
Most species are mainly active during the day (diurnal)|monkey
Monkeys are generally considered to be intelligent, especially the Old World monkeys.|monkey
Simians and tarsiers, the two members of the suborder Haplorhini, emerged some 60 million years ago|monkey
New World monkeys and catarrhine monkeys emerged within the simians some 35 million years ago|monkey
Old World monkeys and apes emerged within the catarrhine monkeys some 25 million years ago|monkey
Extinct basal simians such as Aegyptopithecus or Parapithecus [35–32 million years ago] are also considered monkeys by primatologists.Lemurs, lorises, and galagos are not monkeys; instead they are strepsirrhine primates (suborder Strepsirrhini)|monkey
The simians' sister group, the tarsiers are also haplorhine primates; however, they are also not monkeys.|monkey
"Apes emerged within ""monkeys"" as sister of the Cercopithecidae in the Catarrhini, so cladistically they are monkeys as well"|monkey
"There has been resistance to directly designate apes (and thus humans) as monkeys, so ""Old World monkey"" may be taken to mean either the Cercopithecoidea (not including apes) or the Catarrhini (including apes)"|monkey
That apes are monkeys was already realized by Georges-Louis Leclerc, Comte de Buffon in the 18th century.Monkeys, including apes, can be distinguished from other primates by having only two pectoral nipples, a pendulous penis, and a lack of sensory whiskers.|monkey
"According to the Online Etymology Dictionary, the word ""monkey"" may originate in a German version of the Reynard the Fox fable, published circa 1580"|monkey
In this version of the fable, a character named Moneke is the son of Martin the Ape|monkey
"In English, no clear distinction was originally made between ""ape"" and ""monkey""; thus the 1911 Encyclopædia Britannica entry for ""ape"" notes that it is either a synonym for ""monkey"" or is used to mean a tailless humanlike primate"|monkey
"Colloquially, the terms ""monkey"" and ""ape"" are widely used interchangeably"|monkey
"Also, a few monkey species have the word ""ape"" in their common name, such as the Barbary ape."|monkey
"Later in the first half of the 20th century, the idea developed that there were trends in primate evolution and that the living members of the order could be arranged in a series, leading through ""monkeys"" and ""apes"" to humans"|monkey
"Monkeys thus constituted a ""grade"" on the path to humans and were distinguished from ""apes""."|monkey
Scientific classifications are now more often based on monophyletic groups, that is groups consisting of all the descendants of a common ancestor|monkey
The New World monkeys and the Old World monkeys are each monophyletic groups, but their combination was not, since it excluded hominoids (apes and humans)|monkey
"Thus the term ""monkey"" no longer referred to a recognized scientific taxon"|monkey
The smallest accepted taxon which contains all the monkeys is the infraorder Simiiformes, or simians|monkey
However this also contains the hominoids, so that monkeys are, in terms of currently recognized taxa, non-hominoid simians|monkey
Colloquially and pop-culturally, the term is ambiguous and sometimes monkey includes non-human hominoids|monkey
"In addition, frequent arguments are made for a monophyletic usage of the word ""monkey"" from the perspective that usage should reflect cladistics.A group of monkeys may be commonly referred to as a tribe or a troop.Two separate groups of primates are referred to as ""monkeys"""|monkey
New World monkeys (platyrrhines) from South and Central America and Old World monkeys (catarrhines in the superfamily Cercopithecoidea) from Africa and Asia|monkey
Apes (hominoids)—consisting of gibbons, orangutans, gorillas, chimpanzees, and humans—are also catarrhines but were classically distinguished from monkeys|monkey
"Tailless monkeys may be called ""apes"", incorrectly according to modern usage; thus the tailless Barbary macaque is historically called the ""Barbary ape""."|monkey
As apes have emerged in the monkey group as sister of the old world monkeys, characteristics that describe monkeys are generally shared by apes as well|monkey
Williams et al outlined evolutionary features, including in stem groupings, contrasted against the other primates such as the tarsiers and the lemuriformes.Monkeys range in size from the pygmy marmoset, which can be as small as 117 millimetres (4.6 in) with a 172-millimetre (6.8 in) tail and just over 100 grams (3.5 oz) in weight, to the male mandrill, almost 1 metre (3.3 ft) long and weighing up to 36 kilograms (79 lb)|monkey
Some are arboreal (living in trees) while others live on the savanna; diets differ among the various species but may contain any of the following|monkey
fruit, leaves, seeds, nuts, flowers, eggs and small animals (including insects and spiders).Some characteristics are shared among the groups; most New World monkeys have prehensile tails while Old World monkeys have non-prehensile tails or no visible tail at all|monkey
Old World monkeys have trichromatic color vision like that of humans, while New World monkeys may be trichromatic, dichromatic, or—as in the owl monkeys and greater galagos—monochromatic|monkey
Although both the New and Old World monkeys, like the apes, have forward-facing eyes, the faces of Old World and New World monkeys look very different, though again, each group shares some features such as the types of noses, cheeks and rumps.|monkey

Below is a cladogram with some extinct monkey families|monkey
Generally, extinct non-hominoid simians, including early catarrhines are discussed as monkeys as well as simians or anthropoids, which cladistically means that Hominoidea are monkeys as well, restoring monkeys as a single grouping|monkey
It is indicated approximately how many million years ago (Mya) the clades diverged into newer clades|monkey
"It is thought the New World monkeys started as a drifted ""Old World monkey"" group from the Old World (probably Africa) to the New World (South America)."|monkey
The many species of monkey have varied relationships with humans|monkey
Some are kept as pets, others used as model organisms in laboratories or in space missions|monkey
They may be killed in monkey drives (when they threaten agriculture) or used as service animals for the disabled.|monkey
In some areas, some species of monkey are considered agricultural pests, and can cause extensive damage to commercial and subsistence crops|monkey
This can have important implications for the conservation of endangered species, which may be subject to persecution|monkey
In some instances farmers' perceptions of the damage may exceed the actual damage|monkey
Monkeys that have become habituated to human presence in tourist locations may also be considered pests, attacking tourists.In popular culture monkeys are a symbol of playfulness, mischief and fun.|monkey
Some organizations train capuchin monkeys as service animals to assist quadriplegics and other people with severe spinal cord injuries or mobility impairments|monkey
After being socialized in a human home as infants, the monkeys undergo extensive training before being placed with disabled people|monkey
Around the house, the monkeys assist with daily tasks such as feeding, fetching, manipulating objects, and personal care.Helper monkeys are usually trained in schools by private organizations, taking seven years to train, and are able to serve 25–30 years (two to three times longer than a guide dog).In 2010, the U.S|monkey
federal government revised its definition of service animal under the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA)|monkey
Non-human primates are no longer recognized as service animals under the ADA|monkey
The American Veterinary Medical Association does not support the use of non-human primates as assistance animals because of animal welfare concerns, the potential for serious injury to people, and risks that primates may transfer dangerous diseases to humans.|monkey
The most common monkey species found in animal research are the grivet, the rhesus macaque, and the crab-eating macaque, which are either wild-caught or purpose-bred|monkey
They are used primarily because of their relative ease of handling, their fast reproductive cycle (compared to apes) and their psychological and physical similarity to humans|monkey
Worldwide, it is thought that between 100,000 and 200,000 non-human primates are used in research each year, 64.7% of which are Old World monkeys,|monkey
and 5.5% New World monkeys|monkey
This number makes a very small fraction of all animals used in research|monkey
Between 1994 and 2004 the United States has used an average of 54,000 non-human primates, while around 10,000 non-human primates were used in the European Union in 2002.|monkey
A number of countries have used monkeys as part of their space exploration programmes, including the United States and France|monkey
The first monkey in space was Albert II, who flew in the US-launched V-2 rocket on June 14, 1949.|monkey
Monkey brains are eaten as a delicacy in parts of South Asia, Africa and China|monkey
"Monkeys are sometimes eaten in parts of Africa, where they can be sold as ""bushmeat"""|monkey
In traditional Islamic dietary laws, the eating of monkeys is forbidden.|monkey
Monkeys are prevalent in numerous books, television programs, and movies|monkey
The television series Monkey and the literary characters Monsieur Eek and Curious George are all examples.|monkey
"Informally, ""monkey"" may refer to apes, particularly chimpanzees, gibbons, and gorillas"|monkey
Author Terry Pratchett alludes to this difference in usage in his Discworld novels, in which the Librarian of the Unseen University is an orangutan who gets very violent if referred to as a monkey|monkey
Another example is the use of Simians in Chinese poetry.|monkey
The winged monkeys are prominent characters in L|monkey
Frank Baum's Wizard of Oz books and in the 1939 film based on Baum's 1900 novel The Wonderful Wizard of Oz.|monkey
In Buddhism, the monkey is an early incarnation of Buddha but may also represent trickery and ugliness|monkey
"The Chinese Buddhist ""mind monkey"" metaphor refers to the unsettled, restless state of human mind"|monkey
Monkey is also one of the Three Senseless Creatures, symbolizing greed, with the tiger representing anger and the deer lovesickness.|monkey
"The Sanzaru, or three wise monkeys, are revered in Japanese folklore; together they embody the proverbial principle to ""see no evil, hear no evil, speak no evil"".The Moche people of ancient Peru worshipped nature"|monkey
They placed emphasis on animals and often depicted monkeys in their art.The Tzeltal people of Mexico worshipped monkeys as incarnations of their dead ancestors.|monkey
The Monkey (猴) is the ninth in the twelve-year cycle of animals which appear in the Chinese zodiac related to the Chinese calendar|monkey
The next time that the monkey will appear as the zodiac sign will be in the year 2028.|monkey

The chicken (Gallus gallus domesticus) is a domesticated subspecies of the red junglefowl originally from Southeastern Asia|chicken
Rooster or cock is a term for an adult male bird, and younger male may be called a cockerel|chicken
A male that has been castrated is a capon|chicken
An adult female bird is called a hen and a sexually immature female is called a pullet.|chicken
Originally raised for cockfighting or for special ceremonies, chickens were not kept for food until the Hellenistic period (4th–2nd centuries BC)|chicken
Humans now keep chickens primarily as a source of food (consuming both their meat and eggs) and as pets.|chicken
Chickens are one of the most common and widespread domestic animals, with a total population of 23.7 billion as of 2018, up from more than 19 billion in 2011|chicken
There are more chickens in the world than any other bird|chicken
There are numerous cultural references to chickens – in myth, folklore and religion, and in language and literature.|chicken
Genetic studies have pointed to multiple maternal origins in South Asia, Southeast Asia, and East Asia, but the clade found in the Americas, Europe, the Middle East and Africa originated from the Indian subcontinent|chicken
From ancient India, the chicken spread to Lydia in western Asia Minor, and to Greece by the 5th century BC|chicken
"Fowl have been known in Egypt since the mid-15th century BC, with the ""bird that gives birth every day"" having come from the land between Syria and Shinar, Babylonia, according to the annals of Thutmose III."|chicken
'Chook' |chicken
a chicken (Australia, informal)|chicken
'Pullet:' a young female chicken less than a year old|chicken
In the poultry industry, a pullet is a sexually immature chicken less than 22 weeks of age.|chicken
"'Yardbird:' a chicken (southern United States, dialectal)""Chicken"" was originally a term only for an immature, or at least young, bird"|chicken
However, thanks to its usage on restaurant menus, it has now become the most common term for the subspecies in general, especially in American English|chicken
In older sources, 'chicken' as a species were typically referred to as 'common fowl' or 'domestic fowl'.'Chicken' may also mean a 'chick' (see for example Hen and Chicken Islands).|chicken
"According to Merriam-Webster, the term ""rooster"" (i.e"|chicken
"a roosting bird) originated in the mid- or late 18th century as a euphemism to avoid the sexual connotation of the original English ""cock"", and is widely used throughout North America"|chicken
"""Roosting"" is the action of perching aloft to sleep at night."|chicken
Chickens are omnivores|chicken
In the wild, they often scratch at the soil to search for seeds, insects and even animals as large as lizards, small snakes, or young mice.The average chicken may live for 5-10 years, depending on the breed|chicken
The world's oldest known chicken lived 16 years according to Guinness World Records.|chicken
Roosters can usually be differentiated from hens by their striking plumage of long flowing tails and shiny, pointed feathers on their necks ('hackles') and backs ('saddle'), which are typically of brighter, bolder colours than those of females of the same breed|chicken
However, in some breeds, such as the Sebright chicken, the rooster has only slightly pointed neck feathers, the same colour as the hen's|chicken
The identification can be made by looking at the comb, or eventually from the development of spurs on the male's legs (in a few breeds and in certain hybrids, the male and female chicks may be differentiated by colour)|chicken
Adult chickens have a fleshy crest on their heads called a comb, or cockscomb, and hanging flaps of skin either side under their beaks called wattles|chicken
Collectively, these and other fleshy protuberances on the head and throat are called caruncles|chicken
Both the adult male and female have wattles and combs, but in most breeds these are more prominent in males.|chicken
A 'muff' or 'beard' is a mutation found in several chicken breeds which causes extra feathering under the chicken's face, giving the appearance of a beard.Domestic chickens are not capable of long-distance flight, although lighter chickens are generally capable of flying for short distances, such as over fences or into trees (where they would naturally roost)|chicken
Chickens may occasionally fly briefly to explore their surroundings, but generally do so only to flee perceived danger.|chicken
Chickens are gregarious birds and live together in flocks|chicken
They have a communal approach to the incubation of eggs and raising of young|chicken
"Individual chickens in a flock will dominate others, establishing a ""pecking order"", with dominant individuals having priority for food access and nesting locations"|chicken
Removing hens or roosters from a flock causes a temporary disruption to this social order until a new pecking order is established|chicken
Adding hens, especially younger birds, to an existing flock can lead to fighting and injury.When a rooster finds food, he may call other chickens to eat first|chicken
He does this by clucking in a high pitch as well as picking up and dropping the food|chicken
This behaviour may also be observed in mother hens to call their chicks and encourage them to eat.|chicken
A rooster's crowing is a loud and sometimes shrill call and sends a territorial signal to other roosters|chicken
However, roosters may also crow in response to sudden disturbances within their surroundings|chicken
Hens cluck loudly after laying an egg, and also to call their chicks|chicken
Chickens also give different warning calls when they sense a predator approaching from the air or on the ground.|chicken
Roosters almost always start crowing before four months of age|chicken
Although it is possible for a hen to crow as well, crowing (together with hackles development) is one of the clearest signs of being a rooster.|chicken
Rooster crowing contests, also known as crowing contests, are a traditional sport in several countries, such as Germany, the Netherlands, Belgium, the United States, Indonesia and Japan|chicken
The oldest contests are held with longcrowers|chicken
Depending on the breed, either the duration of the crowing or the times the rooster crows within a certain time is measured.|chicken
"To initiate courting, some roosters may dance in a circle around or near a hen (""a circle dance""), often lowering the wing which is closest to the hen"|chicken
"The dance triggers a response in the hen and when she responds to his ""call"", the rooster may mount the hen and proceed with the mating."|chicken
Hens will often try to lay in nests that already contain eggs and have been known to move eggs from neighbouring nests into their own|chicken
The result of this behaviour is that a flock will use only a few preferred locations, rather than having a different nest for every bird|chicken
Hens will often express a preference to lay in the same location|chicken
It is not unknown for two (or more) hens to try to share the same nest at the same time|chicken
If the nest is small, or one of the hens is particularly determined, this may result in chickens trying to lay on top of each other|chicken
There is evidence that individual hens prefer to be either solitary or gregarious nesters.|chicken
Under natural conditions, most birds lay only until a clutch is complete, and they will then incubate all the eggs|chicken
"Hens are then said to ""go broody"""|chicken
The broody hen will stop laying and instead will focus on the incubation of the eggs (a full clutch is usually about 12 eggs)|chicken
"She will ""sit"" or ""set"" on the nest, fluff up or pecking in defense if disturbed or removed"|chicken
The hen will rarely leave the nest to eat, drink, or dust-bathe|chicken
While brooding, the hen maintains the nest at a constant temperature and humidity, as well as turning the eggs regularly during the first part of the incubation|chicken
To stimulate broodiness, owners may place several artificial eggs in the nest|chicken
To discourage it, they may place the hen in an elevated cage with an open wire floor.|chicken
Breeds artificially developed for egg production rarely go broody, and those that do often stop part-way through the incubation|chicken
However, other breeds, such as the Cochin, Cornish and Silkie, do regularly go broody, and make excellent mothers, not only for chicken eggs but also for those of other species — even those with much smaller or larger eggs and different incubation periods, such as quail, pheasants, ducks, turkeys, or geese.|chicken
Fertile chicken eggs hatch at the end of the incubation period, about 21 days|chicken
Development of the chick starts only when incubation begins, so all chicks hatch within a day or two of each other, despite perhaps being laid over a period of two weeks or so|chicken
Before hatching, the hen can hear the chicks peeping inside the eggs, and will gently cluck to stimulate them to break out of their shells|chicken
"The chick begins by ""pipping""; pecking a breathing hole with its egg tooth towards the blunt end of the egg, usually on the upper side"|chicken
The chick then rests for some hours, absorbing the remaining egg yolk and withdrawing the blood supply from the membrane beneath the shell (used earlier for breathing through the shell)|chicken
The chick then enlarges the hole, gradually turning round as it goes, and eventually severing the blunt end of the shell completely to make a lid|chicken
The chick crawls out of the remaining shell, and the wet down dries out in the warmth of the nest.|chicken
Hens usually remain on the nest for about two days after the first chick hatches, and during this time the newly hatched chicks feed by absorbing the internal yolk sac|chicken
Some breeds sometimes start eating cracked eggs, which can become habitual|chicken
Hens fiercely guard their chicks, and brood them when necessary to keep them warm, at first often returning to the nest at night|chicken
She leads them to food and water and will call them toward edible items, but seldom feeds them directly|chicken
She continues to care for them until they are several weeks old.|chicken
Chickens may occasionally gang up on a weak or inexperienced predator|chicken
At least one credible report exists of a young fox killed by hens|chicken
A group of hens have been recorded in attacking a hawk that had entered their coop.If a chicken is threatened by predators, stress, or is sick, there is a chance that they will puff up their feathers.|chicken
"Sperm transfer occurs by cloacal contact between the male and female, in a maneuver known as the ""cloacal kiss"""|chicken
As with birds in general, reproduction is controlled by a neuroendocrine system, the Gonadotropin-Releasing Hormone-I neurons in the hypothalamus|chicken
Locally to the reproductive system itself, reproductive hormones such as estrogen, progesterone, gonadotropins (luteinizing hormone and follicle-stimulating hormone) initiate and maintain sexual maturation changes|chicken
Over time there is reproductive decline, thought to be due to GnRH-I-N decline|chicken
Because there is significant inter-individual variability in egg-producing duration, it is believed to be possible to breed for further extended useful lifetime in egg-layers.|chicken
Chicken embryos have long been used as model systems to study developing embryos|chicken
Large numbers of embryos can be provided by commercial chicken farmers who sell fertilized eggs which can be easily opened and used to observe the developing embryo|chicken
Equally important, embryologists can carry out experiments on such embryos, close the egg again and study the effect later on|chicken
For instance, many important discoveries in the area of limb development have been made using chicken embryos, such as the discovery of the apical ectodermal ridge (AER) and the zone of polarizing activity (ZPA) by John W|chicken
"Saunders.In 2006, scientists researching the ancestry of birds ""turned on"" a chicken recessive gene, talpid2, and found that the embryo jaws initiated formation of teeth, like those found in ancient bird fossils"|chicken
"John Fallon, the overseer of the project, stated that chickens have ""...retained the ability to make teeth, under certain conditions.."|chicken
"."""|chicken
Given its eminent role in farming, meat production, but also research, the house chicken was the first bird genome to be sequenced|chicken
At 1.21 Gb, the chicken genome is considerably smaller than other vertebrate genomes, such as the human genome (3 Gb)|chicken
The final gene set contained 26,640 genes (including noncoding genes and pseudogenes), with a total of 19,119 protein-coding genes in annotation release 103 (2017), a similar number of protein-coding genes as in the human genome.|chicken
Populations of chickens from high altitude regions like Tibet have special physiological adaptations that result in a higher hatching rate in low oxygen environments|chicken
When eggs are placed in a hypoxic environment, chicken embryos from these populations express much more hemoglobin than embryos from other chicken populations|chicken
This hemoglobin also has a greater affinity for oxygen, allowing hemoglobin to bind to oxygen more readily.Pinopsins were originally discovered in the chicken pineal gland.|chicken
Galliformes, the order of bird that chickens belong to, is directly linked to the survival of birds when all other dinosaurs went extinct|chicken
Water or ground-dwelling fowl, similar to modern partridges, survived the Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event that killed all tree-dwelling birds and dinosaurs|chicken
Some of these evolved into the modern galliformes, of which domesticated chickens are a main model|chicken
They are descended primarily from the red junglefowl (Gallus gallus) and are scientifically classified as the same species|chicken
As such, domesticated chickens can and do freely interbreed with populations of red junglefowl|chicken
Subsequent hybridization of the domestic chicken with grey junglefowl, Sri Lankan junglefowl and green junglefowl occurred; a gene for yellow skin, for instance, was incorporated into domestic birds through hybridization with the grey junglefowl (G|chicken
sonneratii)|chicken
In a study published in 2020, it was found that chickens shared between 71% - 79% of their genome with red junglefowl, with the period of domestication dated to 8,000 years ago.|chicken
The traditional view is that chickens were first domesticated for cockfighting in Asia, Africa, and Europe|chicken
In the last decade, there have been a number of genetic studies to clarify the origins|chicken
According to one early study, a single domestication event of the red junglefowl in what now is the country of Thailand gave rise to the modern chicken with minor transitions separating the modern breeds|chicken
The red junglefowl, known as the bamboo fowl in many Southeast Asian languages, is well adapted to take advantage of the vast quantities of seed produced during the end of the multi-decade bamboo seeding cycle, to boost its own reproduction|chicken
In domesticating the chicken, humans took advantage of this predisposition for prolific reproduction of the red junglefowl when exposed to large amounts of food.Exactly when and where the chicken was domesticated remains a controversial issue|chicken
Genomic studies estimate that the chicken was domesticated 8,000 years ago in Southeast Asia and spread to China and India 2000–3000 years later|chicken
Archaeological evidence supports domestic chickens in Southeast Asia well before 6000 BC, China by 6000 BC and India by 2000 BC|chicken
A landmark 2020 Nature study that fully sequenced 863 chickens across the world suggests that all domestic chickens originate from a single domestication event of red junglefowl whose present-day distribution is predominantly in southwestern China, northern Thailand and Myanmar|chicken
These domesticated chickens spread across Southeast and South Asia where they interbred with local wild species of junglefowl, forming genetically and geographically distinct groups|chicken
Analysis of the most popular commercial breed shows that the White Leghorn breed possesses a mosaic of divergent ancestries inherited from subspecies of red junglefowl.Middle Eastern chicken remains go back to a little earlier than 2000 BC in Syria; chickens went southward only in the 1st millennium BC|chicken
They reached Egypt for purposes of cockfighting about 1400 BC, and became widely bred only in Ptolemaic Egypt (about 300 BC)|chicken
Phoenicians spread chickens along the Mediterranean coasts as far as Iberia|chicken
During the Hellenistic period (4th-2nd centuries BC), in the Southern Levant, chickens began to be widely domesticated for food|chicken
This change occurred at least 100 years before domestication of chickens spread to Europe.|chicken
Chickens reached Europe circa 800 BC|chicken
Breeding increased under the Roman Empire, and was reduced in the Middle Ages|chicken
Genetic sequencing of chicken bones from archaeological sites in Europe revealed that in the High Middle Ages chickens became less aggressive and began to lay eggs earlier in the breeding season.Three possible routes of introduction into Africa around the early first millennium AD could have been through the Egyptian Nile Valley, the East Africa Roman-Greek or Indian trade, or from Carthage and the Berbers, across the Sahara|chicken
The earliest known remains are from Mali, Nubia, East Coast, and South Africa and date back to the middle of the first millennium AD.Domestic chicken in the Americas before Western contact is still an ongoing discussion, but blue-egged chickens, found only in the Americas and Asia, suggest an Asian origin for early American chickens.A lack of data from Thailand, Russia, the Indian subcontinent, Southeast Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa makes it difficult to lay out a clear map of the spread of chickens in these areas; better description and genetic analysis of local breeds threatened by extinction may also help with research into this area.|chicken
An unusual variety of chicken that has its origins in South America is the Araucana, bred in southern Chile by the Mapuche people|chicken
Araucanas lay blue-green eggs|chicken
Additionally, some Araucanas are tailless, and some have tufts of feathers around their ears|chicken
It has long been suggested that they pre-date the arrival of European chickens brought by the Spanish and are evidence of pre-Columbian trans-Pacific contacts between Asian or Pacific Oceanic peoples, particularly the Polynesians, and South America|chicken
In 2007, an international team of researchers reported the results of their analysis of chicken bones found on the Arauco Peninsula in south-central Chile|chicken
Radiocarbon dating suggested that the chickens were pre-Columbian, and DNA analysis showed that they were related to prehistoric populations of chickens in Polynesia|chicken
These results appeared to confirm that the chickens came from Polynesia and that there were transpacific contacts between Polynesia and South America before Columbus's arrival in the Americas.However, a later report looking at the same specimens concluded:|chicken
A published, apparently pre-Columbian, Chilean specimen and six pre-European Polynesian specimens also cluster with the same European/Indian subcontinental/Southeast Asian sequences, providing no support for a Polynesian introduction of chickens to South America|chicken
In contrast, sequences from two archaeological sites on Easter Island group with an uncommon haplogroup from Indonesia, Japan, and China and may represent a genetic signature of an early Polynesian dispersal|chicken
Modeling of the potential marine carbon contribution to the Chilean archaeological specimen casts further doubt on claims for pre-Columbian chickens, and definitive proof will require further analyses of ancient DNA sequences and radiocarbon and stable isotope data from archaeological excavations within both Chile and Polynesia.|chicken
More than 50 billion chickens are reared annually as a source of  meat and eggs|chicken
In the United States alone, more than 8 billion chickens are slaughtered each year for meat, and more than 300 million chickens are reared for egg production.The vast majority of poultry are raised in factory farms|chicken
According to the Worldwatch Institute, 74 percent of the world's poultry meat and 68 percent of eggs are produced this way|chicken
An alternative to intensive poultry farming is free-range farming.|chicken
Friction between these two main methods has led to long-term issues of ethical consumerism|chicken
Opponents of intensive farming argue that it harms the environment, creates human health risks and is inhumane|chicken
Advocates of intensive farming say that their highly efficient systems save land and food resources owing to increased productivity, and that the animals are looked after in state-of-the-art environmentally controlled facilities.|chicken
Chickens farmed for meat are called broilers|chicken
Chickens will naturally live for six or more years, but broiler breeds typically take less than six weeks to reach slaughter size|chicken
A free range or organic broiler will usually be slaughtered at about 14 weeks of age.|chicken
Chickens farmed primarily for eggs are called layer hens|chicken
In total, the UK alone consumes more than 34 million eggs per day|chicken
"Some hen breeds can produce over 300 eggs per year, with ""the highest authenticated rate of egg laying being 371 eggs in 364 days"""|chicken
After 12 months of laying, the commercial hen's egg-laying ability starts to decline to the point where the flock is commercially unviable|chicken
Hens, particularly from battery cage systems, are sometimes infirm or have lost a significant amount of their feathers, and their life expectancy has been reduced from around seven years to less than two years|chicken
"In the UK and Europe, laying hens are then slaughtered and used in processed foods or sold as ""soup hens"""|chicken
In some other countries, flocks are sometimes force moulted, rather than being slaughtered, to re-invigorate egg-laying|chicken
This involves complete withdrawal of food (and sometimes water) for 7–14 days or sufficiently long to cause a body weight loss of 25 to 35%, or up to 28 days under experimental conditions|chicken
This stimulates the hen to lose her feathers, but also re-invigorates egg-production|chicken
Some flocks may be force-moulted several times|chicken
In 2003, more than 75% of all flocks were moulted in the US.|chicken
Keeping chickens as pets became increasingly popular in the 2000s among urban and suburban residents|chicken
Many people obtain chickens for their egg production but often name them and treat them as any other pet like cats or dogs|chicken
Chickens provide companionship and have individual personalities|chicken
While many do not cuddle much, they will eat from one's hand, jump onto one's lap, respond to and follow their handlers, as well as show affection.Chickens are social, inquisitive, intelligent birds, and many find their behaviour entertaining|chicken
Certain breeds, such as Silkies and many bantam varieties, are generally docile and are often recommended as good pets around children with disabilities|chicken
Many people feed chickens in part with kitchen food scraps.|chicken
A cockfight is a contest held in a ring called a cockpit between two cocks known as gamecocks|chicken
"This term, denoting a cock kept for game, sport, pastime or entertainment, appears in 1646, after ""cock of the game"" used by George Wilson in the earliest known book on the secular sport, The Commendation of Cocks and Cock Fighting of 1607"|chicken
Gamecocks are not typical farm chickens|chicken
The cocks are specially bred and trained for increased stamina and strength|chicken
The comb and wattle are removed from a young gamecock because, if left intact, they would be a disadvantage during a match|chicken
This process is called dubbing|chicken
Sometimes the cocks are given drugs to increase their stamina or thicken their blood, which increases their chances of winning|chicken
Cockfighting is considered a traditional sporting event by some, and an example of animal cruelty by others and is therefore outlawed in most countries|chicken
Usually wagers are made on the outcome of the match, with the survivor or last bird standing declared winner.|chicken
"Chickens were originally used for cockfighting, a sport where 2 male chickens or ""cocks"" fight each other until one dies or becomes badly injured"|chicken
Cocks possess congenital aggression toward all other cocks to contest with females|chicken
Studies suggest that cockfights have existed even up to the Indus Valley Civilisation as a pastime|chicken
Today it is commonly associated with religious worship, pastime, and gambling in Asian and some South American countries|chicken
"While not all fights are to the death, most use metal spurs as a ""weapon"" attached above or below the chicken's own spur and with this typically results in death in one or both cocks"|chicken
If chickens are in practice owners place gloves on the spurs to prevent injuries|chicken
Cockfighting has been banned in most western countries and debated by animal rights activist for its brutality.|chicken
Incubation can successfully occur artificially in machines that provide the correct, controlled environment for the developing chick|chicken
The average incubation period for chickens is 21 days but may depend on the temperature and humidity in the incubator|chicken
Temperature regulation is the most critical factor for a successful hatch|chicken
Variations of more than 1 °C (1.8 °F) from the optimum temperature of 37.5 °C (99.5 °F) will reduce hatch rates|chicken
Humidity is also important because the rate at which eggs lose water by evaporation depends on the ambient relative humidity|chicken
Evaporation can be assessed by candling, to view the size of the air sac, or by measuring weight loss|chicken
Relative humidity should be increased to around 70% in the last three days of incubation to keep the membrane around the hatching chick from drying out after the chick cracks the shell|chicken
Lower humidity is usual in the first 18 days to ensure adequate evaporation|chicken
The position of the eggs in the incubator can also influence hatch rates|chicken
For best results, eggs should be placed with the pointed ends down and turned regularly (at least three times per day) until one to three days before hatching|chicken
If the eggs aren't turned, the embryo inside may stick to the shell and may hatch with physical defects|chicken
Adequate ventilation is necessary to provide the embryo with oxygen|chicken
Older eggs require increased ventilation.|chicken
Many commercial incubators are industrial-sized with shelves holding tens of thousands of eggs at a time, with rotation of the eggs a fully automated process|chicken
Home incubators are boxes holding from 6 to 75 eggs; they are usually electrically powered, but in the past some were heated with an oil or paraffin lamp.|chicken
Chickens are susceptible to several parasites, including lice, mites, ticks, fleas, and intestinal worms, as well as other diseases|chicken
Despite the name, they are not affected by chickenpox, which is generally restricted to humans.Chickens can carry and transmit salmonella in their dander and feces|chicken
In the United States, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention advise against bringing them indoors or letting small children handle them.Some of the diseases that can affect chickens are shown below:|chicken
An early domestication of chickens in Southeast Asia is probable, since the word for domestic chicken (*manuk) is part of the reconstructed Proto-Austronesian language (see Austronesian languages)|chicken
Chickens, together with dogs and pigs, were the domestic animals of the Lapita culture, the first Neolithic culture of Oceania.The first pictures of chickens in Europe are found on Corinthian pottery of the 7th century BC.Chickens were spread by Polynesian seafarers and reached Easter Island in the 12th century AD, where they were the only domestic animal, with the possible exception of the Polynesian rat (Rattus exulans)|chicken
"They were housed in extremely solid chicken coops built from stone, which was first reported as such to Linton Palmer in 1868, who also ""expressed his doubts about this""."|chicken

Chick hatching from egg|chicken
The pig (Sus domesticus), often called swine, hog, or domestic pig when distinguishing from other members of the genus Sus, is an omnivorous, domesticated even-toed ungulate|pig
It is variously considered a subspecies of the Eurasian boar or a distinct species, but the American Society of Mammalogists considers it the latter|pig
The pig's head-plus-body length ranges from 0.9 to 1.8 m (3 to 6 ft), and adult pigs typically weigh between 50 and 350 kg (110 and 770 lb), with well-fed individuals even exceeding this range|pig
The size and weight of hogs largely depends on their breed|pig
Compared to other artiodactyls, a pig's head is relatively long and pointed|pig
Most even-toed ungulates are herbivorous, but pigs are omnivores, like their wild relative|pig
Pigs grunt and make snorting sounds.|pig
When used as livestock, pigs are farmed primarily for the production of meat, called pork|pig
A group of pigs is called a passel, a team, or a sounder|pig
The animal's bones, hide, and bristles are also used in products|pig
Pigs, especially miniature breeds, are kept as pets.|pig
The pig typically has a large head, with a long snout which is strengthened by a special prenasal bone and a disk of cartilage at the tip|pig
The snout is used to dig into the soil to find food and is a very acute sense organ|pig
The dental formula of adult pigs is 3.1.4.33.1.4.3, giving a total of 44 teeth|pig
The rear teeth are adapted for crushing|pig
In the male, the canine teeth can form tusks, which grow continuously and are sharpened by constantly being ground against each other.Four hoofed toes are on each foot, with the two larger central toes bearing most of the weight, but the outer two also being used in soft ground.Most pigs have rather a bristled sparse hair covering on their skin, although woolly-coated breeds such as the Mangalitsa exist.Pigs possess both apocrine and eccrine sweat glands, although the latter appear limited to the snout and dorsonasal areas|pig
"Pigs, however, like other ""hairless"" mammals (e.g"|pig
elephants, rhinos, and mole-rats), do not use thermal sweat glands in cooling|pig
Pigs are also less able than many other mammals to dissipate heat from wet mucous membranes in the mouth through panting|pig
Their thermoneutral zone is 16 to 22 °C (61 to 72 °F)|pig
At higher temperatures, pigs lose heat by wallowing in mud or water via evaporative cooling, although it has been suggested that wallowing may serve other functions, such as protection from sunburn, ecto-parasite control, and scent-marking.Pigs are one of four known mammalian species which possess mutations in the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor that protect against snake venom|pig
Mongooses, honey badgers, hedgehogs, and pigs all have modifications to the receptor pocket which prevents the snake venom α-neurotoxin from binding|pig
These represent four separate, independent mutations.Pigs have small lungs in relation to their body size, and are thus more susceptible than other domesticated animals to fatal bronchitis and pneumonia.|pig
The pig is most often considered to be a subspecies of the wild boar, which was given the name Sus scrofa by Carl Linnaeus in 1758; following from this, the formal name of the pig is Sus scrofa domesticus|pig
However, in 1777, Johann Christian Polycarp Erxleben classified the pig as a separate species from the wild boar|pig
He gave it the name Sus domesticus, which is still used by some taxonomists.|pig
Archaeological evidence suggests that pigs were domesticated from wild boar in the Near East in the Tigris Basin, Çayönü, Cafer Höyük, Nevalı Çori being managed in the wild in a way similar to the way they are managed by some modern New Guineans|pig
Remains of pigs have been dated to earlier than 11,400 years ago in Cyprus|pig
Those animals must have been introduced from the mainland, which suggests domestication in the adjacent mainland by then|pig
There was also a separate domestication in China which took place about 8,000 years ago.In the Near East, pig husbandry spread for the next few millennia|pig
It reduced gradually during the Bronze Age, as rural populations focused instead on commodity-producing livestock|pig
It was sustained urbanized regions, however.DNA evidence from subfossil remains of teeth and jawbones of Neolithic pigs shows that the first domestic pigs in Europe had been brought from the Near East|pig
This stimulated the domestication of local European wild boar, resulting in a third domestication event with the Near Eastern genes dying out in European pig stock|pig
Modern domesticated pigs have involved complex exchanges, with European domesticated lines being exported, in turn, to the ancient Near East|pig
Historical records indicate that Asian pigs were introduced into Europe during the 18th and early 19th centuries.In August 2015, a study looked at over 100 pig genome sequences to ascertain their process of domestication, which was assumed to have been initiated by humans, involved few individuals, and relied on reproductive isolation between wild and domestic forms|pig
The study found that the assumption of reproductive isolation with population bottlenecks was not supported|pig
The study indicated that pigs were domesticated separately in Western Asia and China, with Western Asian pigs introduced into Europe, where they crossed with wild boar|pig
A model that fit the data included a mixture with a now extinct ghost population of wild pigs during the Pleistocene|pig
The study also found that despite back-crossing with wild pigs, the genomes of domestic pigs have strong signatures of selection at DNA loci that affect behavior and morphology|pig
The study concluded that human selection for domestic traits likely counteracted the homogenizing effect of gene flow from wild boars and created domestication islands in the genome|pig
The same process may also apply to other domesticated animals|pig
In 2019, a study showed that the pig had arrived in Europe from the Near East 8,500 years ago|pig
Over the next 3,000 years they then admixed with the European wild boar until their genome showed less than 5% Near Eastern ancestry, yet retained their domesticated features.Among the animals that the Spanish introduced to the Chiloé Archipelago in the 16th century, pigs were the most successful to adapt|pig
The pigs benefited from abundant shellfish and algae exposed by the large tides of the archipelago|pig
Pigs were brought to southeastern North America from Europe by de Soto and other early Spanish explorers|pig
Escaped pigs became feral and caused a great deal of disruption to Native Americans.|pig
Feral pig populations in the southeastern United States have since migrated north and are a growing concern in the Midwest|pig
Considered an invasive species, many state agencies have programs to trap or hunt feral pigs as means of removal|pig
Domestic pigs have become feral in many other parts of the world (e.g|pig
New Zealand and northern Queensland) and have caused substantial environmental damage|pig
Feral hybrids of the European wild boar with the domestic pig are also very disruptive to both environment and agriculture (among the 100 most damaging animal species), especially in southeastern South America from Uruguay to Brazil's Mato Grosso do Sul and São Paulo.With around 1 billion individuals alive at any time, the domesticated pig is one of the most numerous large mammals on the planet.|pig
Female pigs reach sexual maturity at 3–12 months of age and come into estrus every 18–24 days if they are not successfully bred|pig
The variation in ovulation rate can be attributed to intrinsic factors such as age and genotype, as well as extrinsic factors like nutrition, environment, and the supplementation of exogenous hormones|pig
The gestation period averages 112–120 days.|pig
Estrus lasts two to three days, and the female's displayed receptiveness to mate is known as standing heat|pig
Standing heat is a reflexive response that is stimulated when the female is in contact with the saliva of a sexually mature boar|pig
Androstenol is one of the pheromones produced in the submaxillary salivary glands of boars that will trigger the female's response|pig
The female cervix contains a series of five interdigitating pads, or folds, that will hold the boar's corkscrew-shaped penis during copulation|pig
Females have bicornuate uteruses and two conceptuses must be present in both uterine horns for pregnancy to be established|pig
Maternal recognition of pregnancy in pigs occurs on days 11 to 12 of pregnancy and is marked by progesterone production from a functioning corpus luteum (CL)|pig
To avoid luteolysis by PGF2α, rescuing of the CL must occur via embryonic signaling of estradiol 17β and PGE2|pig
This signaling acts on both the endometrium and luteal tissue to prevent the regression of the CL by activation of genes that are responsible for CL maintenance|pig
During mid to late pregnancy, the CL relies primarily on luteinizing hormone (LH) for maintenance until parturition|pig
Animal nutrition is important prior to reproduction and during gestation to ensure optimum reproductive performance is achieved.|pig
In many ways, their behaviour appears to be intermediate between that of other artiodactyls and of carnivores|pig
Pigs seek out the company of other pigs and often huddle to maintain physical contact, although they do not naturally form large herds|pig
They typically live in groups of about 8–10 adult sows, some young individuals, and some single males.Because of their relative lack of sweat glands, pigs often control their body temperature using behavioural thermoregulation|pig
Wallowing, which often consists of coating the body with mud, is a behaviour frequently exhibited by pigs|pig
They do not submerge completely under the mud, but vary the depth and duration of wallowing depending on environmental conditions|pig
Typically, adult pigs start wallowing once the ambient temperature is around 17–21 °C (63–70 °F)|pig
They cover themselves from head to toe in mud|pig
Pigs may use mud as a sunscreen, or as a method of keeping parasites away|pig
"Most bristled pigs will ""blow their coat"", meaning that they shed most of the longer, coarser stiff hair once a year, usually in spring or early summer, to prepare for the warmer months ahead.If conditions permit, pigs feed continuously for many hours and then sleep for many hours, in contrast to ruminants which tend to feed for a short time and then sleep for a short time"|pig
Pigs are omnivorous, and are highly versatile in their feeding behaviour|pig
As they are foraging animals, they primarily eat leaves, stems, roots, fruits, and flowers|pig
Pigs play an important role in regions where pig toilets are employed|pig
"Pigs are highly intelligent animals, on par with dogs, and according to David DiSalvo's writing in Forbes, they are ""widely considered the smartest domesticated animal in the world"|pig
"Pigs can move a cursor on a video screen with their snouts and understand what is happening onscreen, and even learn to distinguish between the scribbles they knew from those they saw for the first time."""|pig
Rooting is an instinctual behavior in pigs that is characterized by a pig nudging its snout into something|pig
Similar to a cat's kneading, rooting is found comforting|pig
It first happens when piglets are born to obtain their mother's milk, and can become a habitual, obsessive behavior which is most prominent in animals weaned too early|pig
Often, pigs will root and dig into the ground to forage for food|pig
By means of rooting, pigs have been used to till farmland.|pig
Rooting is known to also be used as a means of communication|pig
Nose rings that pierce the septum of the nose discourage rooting because they make the behavior painful|pig
The breed known as the kunekune hardly ever roots, as it can sustain itself by feeding on nothing other than grass|pig
Not having to root around in the soil to find underground food (e.g|pig
tubers), it thus has evolved to, for the most part, not possess the instinct for rooting.|pig
A behavioural characteristic of pigs which they share with carnivores is nest-building|pig
Sows root in the ground to create depressions and then build nests in which to give birth|pig
First, the sow digs a depression about the size of her body|pig
She then collects twigs and leaves, and carries these in her mouth to the depression, building them into a mound|pig
She distributes the softer, finer material to the centre of the mound using her feet|pig
When the mound reaches the desired height, she places large branches, up to 2 metres in length, on the surface|pig
She enters into the mound and roots around to create a depression within the gathered material|pig
She then gives birth in a lying position, which, again, is different from other artiodactyls, which usually give birth in a standing position.Nest-building behaviour is an important part in the process of pre and post-partum maternal behaviour|pig
Nest-building will occur during the last 24 hours before the onset of farrowing and becomes most intense during 12 to 6 hours before farrowing|pig
Nest-building is divided into two phases|pig
one of which is the initial phase of rooting in the ground while the second phase is the collecting, carrying and arranging of the nest material|pig
The sow will separate from the group and seek a suitable nest site with some shelter from rain and wind that has well-drained soil|pig
This nest-building behaviour is performed to provide the offspring with shelter, comfort, and thermoregulation|pig
The nest will provide protection against weather and predators while keeping the piglets close to the sow and away from the rest of the herd|pig
This ensures they do not get trampled on and that other piglets are not stealing milk from the sow|pig
Nest-building can be influenced by internal and external stimuli|pig
Internal hormonal changes and the completion of one nesting phase are indicators of this maternal behaviour|pig
The onset is triggered by the rise in prolactin levels, which is caused by a decrease in progesterone and an increase in prostaglandin, while the gathering of the nest material seems to be regulated more by external stimuli such as temperature|pig
The longer time spent on nest-building will increase pre-partum oxytocin.|pig
Pigs display complex nursing and suckling behaviour|pig
Nursing occurs every 50–60 minutes, and the sow requires stimulation from piglets before milk let-down|pig
Sensory inputs (vocalisation, odours from mammary and birth fluids and hair patterns of the sow) are particularly important immediately post-birth to facilitate teat location by the piglets|pig
Initially, the piglets compete for position at the udder; then the piglets massage around their respective teats with their snouts, during which time the sow grunts at slow, regular intervals|pig
Each series of grunts varies in frequency, tone and magnitude, indicating the stages of nursing to the piglets.The phase of competition for teats and of nosing the udder lasts for about one minute and ends when milk flow begins|pig
In the third phase, the piglets hold the teats in their mouths and suck with slow mouth movements (one per second), and the rate of the sow's grunting increases for approximately 20 seconds|pig
The grunt peak in the third phase of suckling does not coincide with milk ejection, but rather the release of oxytocin from the pituitary into the bloodstream|pig
Phase four coincides with the period of main milk flow (10–20 seconds) when the piglets suddenly withdraw slightly from the udder and start sucking with rapid mouth movements of about three per second|pig
The sow grunts rapidly, lower in tone and often in quick runs of three or four, during this phase|pig
Finally, the flow stops and so does the grunting of the sow|pig
The piglets may then dart from teat to teat and recommence suckling with slow movements, or nosing the udder|pig
Piglets massage and suckle the sow's teats after milk flow ceases as a way of letting the sow know their nutritional status|pig
This helps her to regulate the amount of milk released from that teat in future sucklings|pig
The more intense the post-feed massaging of a teat, the greater the future milk release from that teat will be.|pig
In pigs, dominance hierarchies can be formed at a very early age|pig
Piglets are highly precocious and within minutes of being born, or sometimes seconds, will attempt to suckle|pig
The piglets are born with sharp teeth and fight to develop a teat order as the anterior teats produce a greater quantity of milk|pig
Once established, this teat order remains stable with each piglet tending to feed on a particular teat or group of teats|pig
Stimulation of the anterior teats appears to be important in causing milk letdown, so it might be advantageous to the entire litter to have these teats occupied by healthy piglets.|pig
Pigs have panoramic vision of approximately 310° and binocular vision of 35° to 50°|pig
It is thought they have no eye accommodation|pig
Other animals that have no accommodation, e.g|pig
sheep, lift their heads to see distant objects|pig
The extent to which pigs have colour vision is still a source of some debate; however, the presence of cone cells in the retina with two distinct wavelength sensitivities (blue and green) suggests that at least some colour vision is present.Pigs have a well-developed sense of smell, and use is made of this in Europe where they are trained to locate underground truffles|pig
Olfactory rather than visual stimuli are used in the identification of other pigs|pig
Hearing is also well developed, and localisation of sounds is made by moving the head|pig
Pigs use auditory stimuli extensively as a means of communication in all social activities|pig
Alarm or aversive stimuli are transmitted to other pigs not only by auditory cues but also by pheromones|pig
Similarly, recognition between the sow and her piglets is by olfactory and vocal cues.|pig
Many breeds of pig exist, with different colors, shapes, and sizes|pig
According to The Livestock Conservancy, as of 2016, three breeds of pig are critically rare (having a global population of fewer than 2000)|pig
They are the Choctaw hog, the Mulefoot, and the Ossabaw Island hog|pig
The smallest known pig breed in the world is the Göttingen minipig, typically weighing about 26 kilograms (57 lb) as a healthy, full-grown adult.|pig
When in use as livestock, the pig is mostly farmed for its meat, pork|pig
Other food products made from pigs include pork sausage (which includes casings that are made from the intestines), bacon, gammon, ham and pork rinds|pig
The head of a pig can be used to make a preserved jelly called head cheese, which is sometimes known as brawn|pig
Liver, chitterlings, blood (for black pudding), and other offal from pigs are also widely used for food|pig
In some religions, such as Judaism and Islam, pork is a taboo food|pig
Approximately 1.5 billion pigs are slaughtered each year for meat.The use of pig milk for human consumption does take place, but as there are certain difficulties in obtaining it, there is little commercial production.|pig
In some developing and developed nations, the pig is usually raised outdoors in yards or fields|pig
In some areas, pigs are allowed to forage in woods where they may be taken care of by swineherds|pig
In industrialized nations such as the United States, pig farming has switched from the traditional pig farm to large-scale intensive pig farms|pig
This has resulted in lower production costs but can cause significant cruelty problems|pig
As consumers have become concerned with the humane treatment of livestock, demand for pasture-raised pork in these nations has increased.|pig
In many respects, pot-bellied pigs are desirable and entertaining pets|pig
They are considered intelligent, gregarious, and trainable|pig
They lack the genetic hereditary weaknesses which commonly afflict certain pedigree cat and dog breeds, are generally quite sturdy, and have a reasonably affordable diet despite requiring large quantities of food|pig
However, they can be strong-willed, defiant, and independent pets which will sometimes defy training|pig
They require access to an outdoor space at all times, and depending on the individual pig, may become housebroken easily or never settle indoors|pig
While hardy, an injured or sick pig will require costly surgery or larger than average quantities of medicine than most pets|pig
Rescuing an abandoned fully-grown pig is usually a more reliable means of getting exactly what you expect than taking a piglet home.Pigs are highly intelligent, social creatures|pig
They are considered hypoallergenic, and are known to do quite well with people who have the usual animal allergies|pig
Since these animals are known to have a life expectancy of 15 to 20 years, they require a long-term commitment.|pig
Given pigs are bred primarily as livestock and have not been bred as companion animals for very long, selective breeding for a placid or biddable temperament is not well established|pig
Pigs have radically different psychology to dogs and exhibit fight-or-flight instincts, independent nature, and natural assertiveness which can manifest as aggression towards children and a tendency to panic and lash out with little warning|pig
Cats generally are safe around pigs as neither species has an incentive to express aggression or fear towards the other, although dogs will view pigs as prey animals and in turn, pigs will challenge dogs for food, leading to very violent fights.|pig
Male and female swine that have not been de-sexed may express unwanted aggressive behavior, and are prone to developing serious health issues|pig
Regular trimming of the hooves is necessary; hooves left untreated cause major pain in the pig, can create malformations in bone structure and may cause him or her to be more susceptible to fungal growth between crevices of the hoof, or between the cracks in a split hoof|pig
Male pigs, especially when left unaltered, can grow large, sharp tusks which may continue growing for years|pig
Domestic owners may wish to keep their pigs' tusks trimmed back, or have them removed entirely.|pig
As prey animals, pigs' natural instinctive behavior causes them to have a strong fear of being picked up, resulting in the animal expressing stress through struggling and squealing, but they will usually calm down once placed back onto the ground|pig
This instinctual fear may be lessened if the pig has been frequently held since infancy|pig
When holding pigs, supporting them under the legs makes being held not as stressful for the animal|pig
Pigs need enrichment activities to keep their intelligent minds occupied; if pigs get bored, they often become destructive|pig
As rooting is found to be comforting, pigs kept in the house may root household objects, furniture or surfaces|pig
While some owners are known to pierce their pigs' noses to discourage rooting behaviour, the efficacy and humaneness of this practice is questionable|pig
Pet pigs should be let outside daily to allow them to fulfill their natural desire of rooting around.|pig
Pigs, both as live animals and a source of post-mortem tissues are one of the most valuable animal models used in biomedical research today, because of their biological, physiological, and anatomical similarities to human beings|pig
For instance, human skin is very similar to the pigskin, therefore pigskin has been used in many preclinical studies|pig
Porcine are used in finding treatments, cures for diseases, xenotransplantation, and for general education|pig
They are also used in the development of medical instruments and devices, surgical techniques and instrumentation, and FDA-approved research|pig
These animals contribute to the reduction methods for animal research, as they supply more information from fewer animals used, for a lower cost.|pig
Pigs are currently thought to be the best non-human candidates for organ donation to humans, and to date they are the only animal that has successfully donated an organ to a human body|pig
The first successful donation of a non-human organ to a human body was conducted on 15 September 2021, when a kidney from a pig was transplanted to a brain-dead human and immediately started functioning similarly to a human kidney|pig
The procedure, led by Dr|pig
Robert Montgomery, used a donor pig that was genetically engineered to not have a specific carbohydrate that the human body considers a threat–Galactose-alpha-1,3-galactose|pig
This followed an earlier major breakthrough when the carbohydrate was removed from genetically engineered mice.Besides similarity between pig and human organs, pigs are among the best animals suited for human donation due the lower risk of cross-species disease transmission|pig
This is caused by pigs' increased phylogenetic distance from humans|pig
Furthermore, they are readily available, and new infectious agents are less likely since they have been in close contact with humans through domestication for many generations.Some obstacles to successful organ donation from a pig to a human arise from the response of the recipient's immune system—generally more extreme than in allotransplantations, ultimately results in rejection of the xenograft, and in some cases results in the death of the recipient—including hyperacute rejection, acute vascular rejection, cellular rejection, and chronic rejection.|pig
Examples of viruses carried by pigs include porcine herpesvirus, rotavirus, parvovirus, and circovirus|pig
Of particular concern are PERVs (porcine endogenous retroviruses), vertically transmitted viruses that embed in swine genomes|pig
The risks with xenosis are twofold, as not only could the individual become infected, but a novel infection could initiate an epidemic in the human population|pig
Because of this risk, the FDA has suggested any recipients of xenotransplants shall be closely monitored for the remainder of their life, and quarantined if they show signs of xenosis.Pig cells have been engineered to inactivate all 62 PERVs in the genome using CRISPR Cas9 genome editing technology, and eliminated infection from the pig to human cells in culture.|pig
