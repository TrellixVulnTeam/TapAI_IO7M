Rat|rat|Rats are various medium-sized, long-tailed rodents
Rat|rat|Species of rats are found throughout the order Rodentia, but stereotypical rats are found in the genus Rattus
Rat|rat|Other rat genera include Neotoma (pack rats), Bandicota (bandicoot rats) and Dipodomys (kangaroo rats).
Rat|rat|Rats are typically distinguished from mice by their size
Rat|rat|"Usually the common name of a large muroid rodent will include the word ""rat"", while a smaller muroid's name will include ""mouse"""
Rat|rat|The common terms rat and mouse are not taxonomically specific
Rat|rat|There are 56 known species of rats in the world.
Rat|rat|The best-known rat species are the black rat (Rattus rattus) and the brown rat (Rattus norvegicus)
Rat|rat|This group, generally known as the Old World rats or true rats, originated in Asia
Rat|rat|Rats are bigger than most Old World mice, which are their relatives, but seldom weigh over 500 grams (17+1⁄2 oz) in the wild.The term rat is also used in the names of other small mammals that are not true rats
Rat|rat|Examples include the North American pack rats (aka wood rats) and a number of species loosely called kangaroo rats
Rat|rat|Rats such as the bandicoot rat (Bandicota bengalensis) are murine rodents related to true rats but are not members of the genus Rattus.
Rat|rat|Male rats are called bucks; unmated females, does, pregnant or parent females, dams; and infants, kittens or pups
Rat|rat|A group of rats is referred to as a mischief.The common species are opportunistic survivors and often live with and near humans; therefore, they are known as commensals
Rat|rat|They may cause substantial food losses, especially in developing countries
Rat|rat|However, the widely distributed and problematic commensal species of rats are a minority in this diverse genus
Rat|rat|Many species of rats are island endemics, some of which have become endangered due to habitat loss or competition with the brown, black, or Polynesian rat.Wild rodents, including rats, can carry many different zoonotic pathogens, such as Leptospira, Toxoplasma gondii, and Campylobacter
Rat|rat|The Black Death is traditionally believed to have been caused by the microorganism Yersinia pestis, carried by the tropical rat flea (Xenopsylla cheopis), which preyed on black rats living in European cities during the epidemic outbreaks of the Middle Ages; these rats were used as transport hosts
Rat|rat|Another zoonotic disease linked to the rat is foot-and-mouth disease.Rats become sexually mature at age 6 weeks, but reach social maturity at about 5 to 6 months of age
Rat|rat|The average lifespan of rats varies by species, but many only live about a year due to predation.The black and brown rats diverged from other Old World rats in the forests of Asia during the beginning of the Pleistocene.
Rat|rat|The characteristic long tail of most rodents is a feature that has been extensively studied in various rat species models, which suggest three primary functions of this structure
Rat|rat|thermoregulation, minor proprioception, and a nocifensive-mediated degloving response
Rat|rat|Rodent tails—particularly in rat models—have been implicated with a thermoregulation function that follows from its anatomical construction
Rat|rat|This particular tail morphology is evident across the family Muridae, in contrast to the bushier tails of Sciuridae, the squirrel family
Rat|rat|The tail is hairless and thin skinned but highly vascularized, thus allowing for efficient countercurrent heat exchange with the environment
Rat|rat|The high muscular and connective tissue densities of the tail, along with ample muscle attachment sites along its plentiful caudal vertebrae, facilitate specific proprioceptive senses to help orient the rodent in a three-dimensional environment
Rat|rat|Murids have evolved a unique defense mechanism termed degloving that allows for escape from predation through the loss of the outermost integumentary layer on the tail
Rat|rat|However, this mechanism is associated with multiple pathologies that have been the subject of investigation.Multiple studies have explored the thermoregulatory capacity of rodent tails by subjecting test organisms to varying levels of physical activity and quantifying heat conduction via the animals' tails
Rat|rat|One study demonstrated a significant disparity in heat dissipation from a rat's tail relative to its abdomen
Rat|rat|This observation was attributed to the higher proportion of vascularity in the tail, as well as its higher surface-area-to-volume ratio, which directly relates to heat's ability to dissipate via the skin
Rat|rat|These findings were confirmed in a separate study analyzing the relationships of heat storage and mechanical efficiency in rodents that exercise in warm environments
Rat|rat|In this study, the tail was a focal point in measuring heat accumulation and modulation.On the other hand, the tail's ability to function as a proprioceptive sensor and modulator has also been investigated
Rat|rat|As aforementioned, the tail demonstrates a high degree of muscularization and subsequent innervation that ostensibly collaborate in orienting the organism
Rat|rat|Specifically, this is accomplished by coordinated flexion and extension of tail muscles to produce slight shifts in the organism's center of mass, orientation, etc., which ultimately assists it with achieving a state of proprioceptive balance in its environment
Rat|rat|Further mechanobiological investigations of the constituent tendons in the tail of the rat have identified multiple factors that influence how the organism navigates its environment with this structure
Rat|rat|A particular example is that of a study in which the morphology of these tendons is explicated in detail
Rat|rat|Namely, cell viability tests of tendons of the rat's tail demonstrate a higher proportion of living fibroblasts that produce the collagen for these fibers
Rat|rat|As in humans, these tendons contain a high density of golgi tendon organs that help the animal assess stretching of muscle in situ and adjust accordingly by relaying the information to higher cortical areas associated with balance, proprioception, and movement.The characteristic tail of murids also displays a unique defense mechanism known as degloving in which the outer layer of the integument can be detached in order to facilitate the animal's escape from a predator
Rat|rat|This evolutionary selective pressure has persisted despite a multitude of pathologies that can manifest upon shedding part of the tail and exposing more interior elements to the environment
Rat|rat|Paramount among these are bacterial and viral infection, as the high density of vascular tissue within the tail becomes exposed upon avulsion or similar injury to the structure
Rat|rat|The degloving response is a nocifensive response, meaning that it occurs when the animal is subjected to acute pain, such as when a predator snatches the organism by the tail.
Rat|rat|Specially bred rats have been kept as pets at least since the late 19th century
Rat|rat|Pet rats are typically variants of the species brown rat, but black rats and giant pouched rats are also sometimes kept
Rat|rat|Pet rats behave differently from their wild counterparts depending on how many generations they have been kept as pets
Rat|rat|Pet rats do not pose any more of a health risk than pets such as cats or dogs
Rat|rat|Tamed rats are generally friendly and can be taught to perform selected behaviors.
Rat|rat|Selective breeding has brought about different color and marking varieties in rats
Rat|rat|Genetic mutations have also created different fur types, such as rex and hairless
Rat|rat|Congenital malformation in selective breeding have created the dumbo rat, a popular pet choice due to their low, saucer-shaped ears
Rat|rat|A breeding standard exists for rat fanciers wishing to breed and show their rat at a rat show.
Rat|rat|In 1895, Clark University in Worcester, Massachusetts, established a population of domestic albino brown rats to study the effects of diet and for other physiological studies
Rat|rat|Over the years, rats have been used in many experimental studies, adding to our understanding of genetics, diseases, the effects of drugs, and other topics that have provided a great benefit for the health and wellbeing of humankind.The aortic arches of the rat are among the most commonly studied in murine models due to marked anatomical homology to the human cardiovascular system
Rat|rat|Both rat and human aortic arches exhibit subsequent branching of the brachiocephalic trunk, left common carotid artery, and left subclavian artery, as well as geometrically similar, nonplanar curvature in the aortic branches
Rat|rat|Aortic arches studied in rats exhibit abnormalities similar to those of humans, including altered pulmonary arteries and double or absent aortic arches
Rat|rat|Despite existing anatomical analogy in the inthrathoracic position of the heart itself, the murine model of the heart and its structures remains a valuable tool for studies of human cardiovascular conditions.The rat's larynx has been used in experimentations that involve inhalation toxicity, allograft rejection, and irradiation responses
Rat|rat|One experiment described four features of the rat's larynx
Rat|rat|The first being the location and attachments of the thyroarytenoid muscle, the alar cricoarytenoid muscle, and the superior cricoarytenoid muscle, the other of the newly named muscle that ran from the arytenoid to a midline tubercle on the cricoid
Rat|rat|The newly named muscles were not seen in the human larynx
Rat|rat|In addition, the location and configuration of the laryngeal alar cartilage was described
Rat|rat|The second feature was that the way the newly named muscles appear to be familiar to those in the human larynx
Rat|rat|The third feature was that a clear understanding of how MEPs are distributed in each of the laryngeal muscles was helpful in understanding the effects of botulinum toxin injection
Rat|rat|The MEPs in the posterior
Rat|rat|cricoarytenoid muscle were focused mostly at the midbelly
Rat|rat|In addition, the medial thyroarytenoid muscle were focused at the midbelly while the lateral thyroarytenoid muscle MEPs were focused at the anterior third of the belly
Rat|rat|The fourth and final feature that was cleared up was how the MEPs were distributed in the thyroarytenoid muscle.Laboratory rats have also proved valuable in psychological studies of learning and other mental processes (Barnett 2002), as well as to understand group behavior and overcrowding (with the work of John B
Rat|rat|Calhoun on behavioral sink)
Rat|rat|A 2007 study found rats to possess metacognition, a mental ability previously only documented in humans and some primates.Domestic rats differ from wild rats in many ways
Rat|rat|They are calmer and less likely to bite; they can tolerate greater crowding; they breed earlier and produce more offspring; and their brains, livers, kidneys, adrenal glands, and hearts are smaller (Barnett 2002).
Rat|rat|Brown rats are often used as model organisms for scientific research
Rat|rat|Since the publication of the rat genome sequence, and other advances, such as the creation of a rat SNP chip, and the production of knockout rats, the laboratory rat has become a useful genetic tool, although not as popular as mice
Rat|rat|When it comes to conducting tests related to intelligence, learning, and drug abuse, rats are a popular choice due to their high intelligence, ingenuity, aggressiveness, and adaptability
Rat|rat|"Their psychology seems in many ways similar to that of humans.Entirely new breeds or ""lines"" of brown rats, such as the Wistar rat, have been bred for use in laboratories"
Rat|rat|Much of the genome of Rattus norvegicus has been sequenced.
Rat|rat|"Early studies found evidence both for and against measurable intelligence using the ""g factor"" in rats"
Rat|rat|Part of the difficulty of understanding animal cognition generally, is determining what to measure
Rat|rat|One aspect of intelligence is the ability to learn, which can be measured using a maze like the T-maze
Rat|rat|Experiments done in the 1920s showed that some rats performed better than others in maze tests, and if these rats were selectively bred, their offspring also performed better, suggesting that in rats an ability to learn was heritable in some way.
Rat|rat|Rats have been used as working animals
Rat|rat|Tasks for working rats include the sniffing of gunpowder residue, demining, acting and animal-assisted therapy.
Rat|rat|Rats have a keen sense of smell and are easy to train
Rat|rat|These characteristics have been employed, for example, by the Belgian non-governmental organization APOPO, which trains rats (specifically African giant pouched rats) to detect landmines and diagnose tuberculosis through smell.
Rat|rat|Rats have long been considered deadly pests
Rat|rat|Once considered a modern myth, the rat flood in India occurs every fifty years, as armies of bamboo rats descend upon rural areas and devour everything in their path
Rat|rat|Rats have long been held up as the chief villain in the spread of the Bubonic Plague; however, recent studies show that rats alone could not account for the rapid spread of the disease through Europe in the Middle Ages
Rat|rat|Still, the Centers for Disease Control does list nearly a dozen diseases directly linked to rats.
Rat|rat|Most urban areas battle rat infestations
Rat|rat|A 2015 study by the American Housing Survey (AHS) found that eighteen percent of homes in Philadelphia showed evidence of rodents
Rat|rat|Boston, New York City, and Washington, D.C., also demonstrated significant rodent infestations
Rat|rat|Indeed, rats in New York City are famous for their size and prevalence
Rat|rat|The urban legend that the rat population in Manhattan equals that of its human population was definitively refuted by Robert Sullivan in his book Rats but illustrates New Yorkers' awareness of the presence, and on occasion boldness and cleverness, of the rodents
Rat|rat|"New York has specific regulations for eradicating rats; multifamily residences and commercial businesses must use a specially trained and licensed rat catcher.Chicago was declared the ""rattiest city"" in the US by the pest control company Orkin in 2020, for the sixth consecutive time"
Rat|rat|It's followed by Los Angeles, New York, Washington, DC, and San Francisco
Rat|rat|To help combat the problem, a Chicago animal shelter has placed more than 1000 feral cats (sterilized and vaccinated) outside of homes and businesses since 2012, where they hunt and catch rats while also providing a deterrent simply by their presence.Rats have the ability to swim up sewer pipes into toilets
Rat|rat|Rats will infest any area that provides shelter and easy access to sources of food and water, including under sinks, near garbage, and inside walls or cabinets.
Rat|rat|When introduced into locations where rats previously did not exist, they can wreak an enormous degree of environmental degradation
Rat|rat|Rattus rattus, the black rat, is considered to be one of the world's worst invasive species
Rat|rat|Also known as the ship rat, it has been carried worldwide as a stowaway on seagoing vessels for millennia and has usually accompanied men to any new area visited or settled by human beings by sea
Rat|rat|The similar species Rattus norvegicus, the brown rat or wharf rat, has also been carried worldwide by ships in recent centuries.The ship or wharf rat has contributed to the extinction of many species of wildlife, including birds, small mammals, reptiles, invertebrates, and plants, especially on islands
Rat|rat|True rats are omnivorous, capable of eating a wide range of plant and animal foods, and have a very high birth rate
Rat|rat|When introduced to a new area, they quickly reproduce to take advantage of the new food supply
Rat|rat|In particular, they prey on the eggs and young of forest birds, which on isolated islands often have no other predators and thus have no fear of predators
Rat|rat|Some experts believe that rats are to blame for between forty percent and sixty percent of all seabird and reptile extinctions, with ninety percent of those occurring on islands
Rat|rat|Thus man has indirectly caused the extinction of many species by accidentally introducing rats to new areas.
Rat|rat|Rats are found in nearly all areas of Earth which are inhabited by human beings
Rat|rat|The only rat-free continent is Antarctica, which is too cold for rat survival outdoors, and its lack of human habitation does not provide buildings to shelter them from the weather
Rat|rat|However, rats have been introduced to many of the islands near Antarctica, and because of their destructive effect on native flora and fauna, efforts to eradicate them are ongoing
Rat|rat|In particular, Bird Island (just off rat-infested South Georgia Island), where breeding seabirds could be badly affected if rats were introduced, is subject to special measures and regularly monitored for rat invasions.As part of island restoration, some islands' rat populations have been eradicated to protect or restore the ecology
Rat|rat|Hawadax Island, Alaska was declared rat free after 229 years and Campbell Island, New Zealand after almost 200 years
Rat|rat|Breaksea Island in New Zealand was declared rat free in 1988 after an eradication campaign based on a successful trial on the smaller Hawea Island nearby.
Rat|rat|"In January 2015, an international ""Rat Team"" set sail from the Falkland Islands for the British Overseas Territory of South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands on board a ship carrying three helicopters and 100 tons of rat poison with the objective of ""reclaiming the island for its seabirds"""
Rat|rat|Rats have wiped out more than 90% of the seabirds on South Georgia, and the sponsors hope that once the rats are gone, it will regain its former status as home to the greatest concentration of seabirds in the world
Rat|rat|"The South Georgia Heritage Trust, which organized the mission describes it as ""five times larger than any other rodent eradication attempted worldwide"""
Rat|rat|That would be true if it were not for the rat control program in Alberta (see below).
Rat|rat|The Canadian province of Alberta is notable for being the largest inhabited area on Earth which is free of true rats due to very aggressive government rat control policies
Rat|rat|It has large numbers of native pack rats, also called bushy-tailed wood rats, but they are forest-dwelling vegetarians which are much less destructive than true rats.Alberta was settled relatively late in North American history and only became a province in 1905
Rat|rat|Black rats cannot survive in its climate at all, and brown rats must live near people and in their structures to survive the winters
Rat|rat|There are numerous predators in Canada's vast natural areas which will eat non-native rats, so it took until 1950 for invading rats to make their way over land from Eastern Canada
Rat|rat|Immediately upon their arrival at the eastern border with Saskatchewan, the Alberta government implemented an extremely aggressive rat control program to stop them from advancing further
Rat|rat|A systematic detection and eradication system was used throughout a control zone about 600 kilometres (400 mi) long and 30 kilometres (20 mi) wide along the eastern border to eliminate rat infestations before the rats could spread further into the province
Rat|rat|Shotguns, bulldozers, high explosives, poison gas, and incendiaries were used to destroy rats
Rat|rat|Numerous farm buildings were destroyed in the process
Rat|rat|Initially, tons of arsenic trioxide were spread around thousands of farm yards to poison rats, but soon after the program commenced the rodenticide and medical drug warfarin was introduced, which is much safer for people and more effective at killing rats than arsenic.Forceful government control measures, strong public support and enthusiastic citizen participation continue to keep rat infestations to a minimum
Rat|rat|The effectiveness has been aided by a similar but newer program in Saskatchewan which prevents rats from even reaching the Alberta border
Rat|rat|Alberta still employs an armed rat patrol to control rats along Alberta's borders
Rat|rat|About ten single rats are found and killed per year, and occasionally a large localized infestation has to be dug out with heavy machinery, but the number of permanent rat infestations is zero.
Rat|rat|The rat (sometimes referred to as a mouse) is the first of the twelve animals of the Chinese zodiac
Rat|rat|People born in this year are expected to possess qualities associated with rats, including creativity, intelligence, honesty, generosity, ambition, a quick temper and wastefulness
Rat|rat|"People born in a year of the rat are said to get along well with ""monkeys"" and ""dragons"", and to get along poorly with ""horses""."
Rat|rat|In Indian tradition, rats are seen as the vehicle of Ganesha, and a rat's statue is always found in a temple of Ganesh
Rat|rat|In the northwestern Indian city of Deshnoke, the rats at the Karni Mata Temple are held to be destined for reincarnation as Sadhus (Hindu holy men)
Rat|rat|The attending priests feed milk and grain to the rats, of which the pilgrims also partake.
Rat|rat|European associations with the rat are generally negative
Rat|rat|"For instance, ""Rats!"" is used as a substitute for various vulgar interjections in the English language"
Rat|rat|These associations do not draw, per se, from any biological or behavioral trait of the rat, but possibly from the association of rats (and fleas) with the 14th-century medieval plague called the Black Death
Rat|rat|Rats are seen as vicious, unclean, parasitic animals that steal food and spread disease
Rat|rat|However, some people in European cultures keep rats as pets and conversely find them to be tame, clean, intelligent, and playful.
Rat|rat|Rats are often used in scientific experiments; animal rights activists allege the treatment of rats in this context is cruel
Rat|rat|"The term ""lab rat"" is used, typically in a self-effacing manner, to describe a person whose job function requires them to spend a majority of their work time engaged in bench-level research (such as postgraduate students in the sciences)."
Rat|rat|Rats are frequently blamed for damaging food supplies and other goods, or spreading disease
Rat|rat|Their reputation has carried into common parlance
Rat|rat|"in the English language, ""rat"" is often an insult or is generally used to signify an unscrupulous character; it is also used, as a synonym for the term nark, to mean an individual who works as a police informant or who has turned state's evidence"
Rat|rat|"Writer/director Preston Sturges created the humorous alias ""Ratskywatsky"" for a soldier who seduced, impregnated, and abandoned the heroine of his 1944 film, The Miracle of Morgan's Creek"
Rat|rat|"It is a term (noun and verb) in criminal slang for an informant – ""to rat on someone"" is to betray them by informing the authorities of a crime or misdeed they committed"
Rat|rat|"Describing a person as ""rat-like"" usually implies he or she is unattractive and suspicious."
Rat|rat|Depictions of rats in fiction are historically inaccurate and negative
Rat|rat|The most common falsehood is the squeaking almost always heard in otherwise realistic portrayals (i.e
Rat|rat|nonanthropomorphic)
Rat|rat|While the recordings may be of actual squeaking rats, the noise is uncommon – they may do so only if distressed, hurt, or annoyed
Rat|rat|Normal vocalizations are very high-pitched, well outside the range of human hearing
Rat|rat|Rats are also often cast in vicious and aggressive roles when in fact, their shyness helps keep them undiscovered for so long in an infested home.
Rat|rat|The actual portrayals of rats vary from negative to positive with a majority in the negative and ambiguous
Rat|rat|The rat plays a villain in several mouse societies; from Brian Jacques's Redwall and Robin Jarvis's The Deptford Mice, to the roles of Disney's Professor Ratigan and Kate DiCamillo's Roscuro and Botticelli
Rat|rat|They have often been used as a mechanism in horror; being the titular evil in stories like The Rats or H.P
Rat|rat|Lovecraft's The Rats in the Walls and in films like Willard and Ben
Rat|rat|Another terrifying use of rats is as a method of torture, for instance in Room 101 in George Orwell's Nineteen Eighty-Four or The Pit and the Pendulum by Edgar Allan Poe.
Rat|rat|Selfish helpfulness —those willing to help for a price— has also been attributed to fictional rats
Rat|rat|Templeton, from E
Rat|rat|B
Rat|rat|White's Charlotte's Web, repeatedly reminds the other characters that he is only involved because it means more food for him, and the cellar-rat of John Masefield's The Midnight Folk requires bribery to be of any assistance.
Rat|rat|Some fictional works use rats as the main characters
Rat|rat|Notable examples include the society created by O'Brien's Mrs
Rat|rat|Frisby and the Rats of NIMH, and others include Doctor Rat, and Rizzo the Rat from The Muppets
Rat|rat|"Pixar's 2007 animated film Ratatouille is about a rat described by Roger Ebert as ""earnest.."
Rat|rat|"lovable, determined, [and] gifted"" who lives with a Parisian garbage-boy-turned-chef.Mon oncle d'Amérique (""My American Uncle""), a 1980 French film, illustrates Henri Laborit's theories on evolutionary psychology and human behaviors by using short sequences in the storyline showing lab rat experiments."
Rat|rat|In Harry Turtledove's science fiction novel Homeward Bound, humans unintentionally introduce rats to the ecology at the home world of an alien race which previously invaded Earth and introduced some of its own fauna into its environment
Rat|rat|A
Rat|rat|Bertram Chandler pitted the space-bound protagonist of a long series of novels, Commodore Grimes, against giant, intelligent rats who took over several stellar systems and enslaved their human inhabitants
Rat|rat|"""The Stainless Steel Rat"" is nickname of the (human) protagonist of a series of humorous science fiction novels written by Harry Harrison."
Rat|rat|Wererats, therianthropic creatures able to take the shape of a rat, have appeared in the fantasy or horror genre since the 1970s
Rat|rat|The term is a neologism coined in analogy to werewolf
Rat|rat|The concept has since become common in role playing games like Dungeons & Dragons and fantasy fiction like the Anita Blake series.
Rat|rat|"One of the oldest and most historic stories about rats is ""The Pied Piper of Hamelin"", in which a rat-catcher leads away an infestation with enchanted music"
Rat|rat|The piper is later refused payment, so he in turn leads away the town's children
Rat|rat|This tale, traced to Germany around the late 13th century, has inspired adaptations in film, theatre, literature, and even opera
Rat|rat|The subject of much research, some theories have intertwined the tale with events related to the Black Plague, in which black rats played an important role
Rat|rat|Fictional works based on the tale that focus heavily on the rat aspect include Pratchett's The Amazing Maurice and his Educated Rodents, and Belgian graphic novel Le Bal du Rat Mort (The Ball of the Dead Rat)
Rat|rat|"Furthermore, a linguistic phenomenon when a wh-expression drags with it an entire encompassing phrase to the front of the clause has been named pied-piping after ""Pied Piper of Hamlin"" (see also pied-piping with inversion)."

Rat-baiting|rat|Rat-baiting is a blood sport that involves releasing captured rats in an enclosed space with spectators betting on how long a dog, usually a terrier, takes to kill the rats
Rat-baiting|rat|Often, two dogs competed, with the winner receiving a cash prize
Rat-baiting|rat|It is now illegal in most countries.
Rat-baiting|rat|In 1835, the Parliament of the United Kingdom implemented an act called the Cruelty to Animals Act 1835, which prohibited the baiting of some animals such as the bull, bear, and other large animals
Rat-baiting|rat|However, the law was not enforced for rat baiting and competitions came to the forefront as a gambling sport
Rat-baiting|rat|At one time, London had at least 70 rat pits.
Rat-baiting|rat|This was a rather dirty, small place, in the middle of the Cambridge Circus, London
Rat-baiting|rat|You went down a rotten wooden stair and entered a large, underground cellar, which was created by combining the cellars of two houses
Rat-baiting|rat|The cellar was full of smoke, stench of rats, dogs, and dirty human beings, as well
Rat-baiting|rat|The stale smell of flat beer was almost overpowering
Rat-baiting|rat|Gas lights illuminated the centre of the cellar, a ring enclosed by wood barriers similar to a small Roman circus arena, and wooden bleachers, arranged one over the other, rose stepwise above it nearly to the ceiling
Rat-baiting|rat|This was the pit for dog fights, cockfights, and rat killing
Rat-baiting|rat|A hundred rats were put in it; large wagers went back and forth on whose dog could kill the most rats within a minute
Rat-baiting|rat|The dogs worked in exemplary fashion, a grip, a toss, and it was all over for the rat
Rat-baiting|rat|With especially skilful dogs, two dead rats flew through the air at the same time ...
Rat-baiting|rat|The officials included a referee and timekeeper
Rat-baiting|rat|Pits were sometimes covered above with wire mesh or had additional security devices installed on the walls to prevent the rats from escaping
Rat-baiting|rat|Rules varied from match to match.
Rat-baiting|rat|In one variation, a weight handicap was set for each dog
Rat-baiting|rat|The competing dog had to kill as many rats as the number of pounds the dog weighed, within a specific, preset time
Rat-baiting|rat|The prescribed number of rats was released and the dog was put in the ring
Rat-baiting|rat|The clock started the moment the dog touched the ground
Rat-baiting|rat|When the dog seized the last rat, his owner grabbed it and the clock stopped.
Rat-baiting|rat|Rats that were thought still to be alive were laid out on the table in a circle before the referee
Rat-baiting|rat|The referee then struck the animals three times on the tail with a stick
Rat-baiting|rat|If a rat managed to crawl out of the circle, it was considered to be alive
Rat-baiting|rat|Depending on the particular rules for that match, the dog may be disqualified or have to go back in the ring with these rats and kill them
Rat-baiting|rat|The new time was added to the original time.
Rat-baiting|rat|A combination of the quickest time, the number of rats, and the dog's weight decided the victory
Rat-baiting|rat|A rate of five seconds per rat killed was considered quite satisfactory; 15 rats in a minute was an excellent result.
Rat-baiting|rat|Cornered rats will attack and can deliver a very painful bite
Rat-baiting|rat|Not uncommonly, a ratter was left with only one eye in its retirement.
Rat-baiting|rat|Before the contest could begin, the capture of potentially thousands of rats was required
Rat-baiting|rat|The rat catcher would be called upon to fulfill this requirement
Rat-baiting|rat|Jack Black, a rat catcher from Victorian England supplied live rats for baiting.
Rat-baiting|rat|Faster dogs were preferred
Rat-baiting|rat|They would bite once
Rat-baiting|rat|"The process was described as ""rather like a sheepdog keeping a flock bunched to be brought out singly for dipping,"" where the dog would herd the rats together, and kill any rats that left the pack with a quick bite."
Rat-baiting|rat|The ratting dogs were typically working terrier breeds, which included the bull and terrier, Bull Terrier, Bedlington Terrier, Fox Terrier, Jack Russell Terrier, Rat Terrier, Black and Tan Terrier, Manchester Terrier, Yorkshire Terrier,   and Staffordshire Bull Terrier
Rat-baiting|rat|The degree of care used in breeding these ratters is clear in their pedigrees, with good breeding leading to increased business opportunities
Rat-baiting|rat|Successful breeders were highly regarded in those times
Rat-baiting|rat|In modern times, the Plummer Terrier is considered a premiere breed for rat-catching.
Rat-baiting|rat|"A celebrated bull and terrier named ""Billy"" weighing about 12 kg (26 lb), had a proud fighting history and his pedigree reflects the build-up over a period of years"
Rat-baiting|rat|The dog was owned by Charles Dew and was bred by breeder James Yardington
Rat-baiting|rat|"On the paternal side is ""Old Billy"" from the kennel of John Tattersal from Wotton-under-Edge, Gloucestershire, and was descended from the best line of all Old English Bulldogs"
Rat-baiting|rat|"On the maternal side is ""Yardington's Sal"" descended from the Curley line"
Rat-baiting|rat|The pedigree of all these dogs can be traced back more than 40  years and numerous old accounts exist about them.The October 1822, edition of The Sporting Magazine provided descriptions of two rat pit matches with Billy, quoted as:
Rat-baiting|rat|Thursday night, Oct
Rat-baiting|rat|24, at a quarter before eight o'clock, the lovers of rat killing enjoyed a feast of delight in a prodigious raticide at the Cockpit, Westminster
Rat-baiting|rat|The place was crowded
Rat-baiting|rat|The famous dog Billy, of rat-killing notoriety, 26 lb
Rat-baiting|rat|weight, was wagered, for 20 sovereigns, to kill 100 rats in 12 minutes
Rat-baiting|rat|The rats were turned out loose at once in a 12-foot square, and the floor whitened, so that the rats might be visible to all
Rat-baiting|rat|The set-to began, and Billy exerted himself to the utmost
Rat-baiting|rat|At four minutes and three-quarters, as the hero's head was covered with gore, he was removed from the pit, and his chaps being washed, he lapped some water to cool his throat
Rat-baiting|rat|Again he entered the arena, and in vain did the unfortunate victims labour to obtain security by climbing against the sides of the pit, or by crouching beneath the hero
Rat-baiting|rat|By twos and threes, they were caught, and soon their mangled corpses proved the valour of the victor
Rat-baiting|rat|Some of the flying enemy, more valiant than the rest, endeavoured by seizing this Quinhus Flestrum of heroic dogs by the ears, to procure a respite, or to sell their life as dearly as possible; but his grand paw soon swept off the buzzers, and consigned them to their fate
Rat-baiting|rat|At seven minutes and a quarter, or according to another watch, for there were two umpires and two watches, at seven minutes and seventeen seconds, the victor relinquished the glorious pursuit, for all his foes lay slaughtered on the ensanguined plain
Rat-baiting|rat|Billy was then caressed and fondled by many; the dog is estimated by amateurs as a most dextrous animal; he is, unfortunately, what the French Monsieurs call borg-ne, that is, blind of an eye.-This precious organ was lost to him some time since by the intrepidity of an inimical rat, which as he had not seized it in a proper place, turned round on its murderer, and reprived him by one bite of the privilege of seeing with two eyes in future
Rat-baiting|rat|The dog BILLY, of rat-killing notoriety, on the evening of the 13th instant, again exhibited his surprising dexterity; he was wagered to kill one hundred rats within twelve minutes; but six minutes and 25 seconds only elapsed, when every rat lay stretched on the gory plain, without the least symptom of life appearing.' Billy was decorated with a silver collar, and a number of ribband bows, and was led off amidst the applauses of the persons assembled.
Rat-baiting|rat|Billy's career was crowned on 22 April 1823, when a world record was set with 100  rats killed in five and a half minutes
Rat-baiting|rat|"This record stood until 1862, when it was claimed by another ratter named ""Jacko"""
Rat-baiting|rat|Billy continued in the rat pit until old age, reportedly with only one eye and two teeth remaining.
Rat-baiting|rat|"According to the Sporting Chronicle Annual, the world record in rat killing is held by a black and tan bull and terrier named ""Jacko"", weighing about 13 lb and owned by Jemmy Shaw"
Rat-baiting|rat|Jacko had these contest results:
Rat-baiting|rat|"Jacko set two world records, the first on 29 July 1862, with a killing time of 2.7 seconds per rat and the second on 1 May 1862, with his fight against 100 rats, where Jacko worked two seconds faster than the previous world record holder ""Billy"""
Rat-baiting|rat|The feat of killing 1,000 rats took place over a 10-week period, with 100 rats being killed each week ending on 1 May 1862.
Rat-baiting|rat|Tiny the Wonder was a famous mid-19th century English Toy Terrier (Black & Tan) that could kill 200 rats in an hour, which he achieved twice, on 28 March 1848 and 27 March 1849, with time to spare
Rat-baiting|rat|For a period of time Tiny maintained the record for killing 300 rats in under 55 minutes
Rat-baiting|rat|Tiny only weighed five and a  half pounds with a neck so small, a woman's bracelet could be used as a dog collar
Rat-baiting|rat|From 1848 to 1849, Tiny was owned by Jemmy Shaw, the landlord of the Blue Anchor Tavern at 102 Bunhill Row, St
Rat-baiting|rat|Luke's, London Borough of Islington; the pub is now named the Artillery Arms
Rat-baiting|rat|Tiny was a star attraction at the Blue Anchor Tavern, with crowds gathering to watch the action in the rat pit
Rat-baiting|rat|Shaw preferred to acquire the rats from Essex as opposed to sewer rats to decrease potential health risks to Tiny
Rat-baiting|rat|Shaw was able to keep up to 2,000 rats at his establishment
Rat-baiting|rat|This is a commentary about Tiny from a poster published from those times:
Rat-baiting|rat|"""The 5 1/2 pounds of black and tan fury"
Rat-baiting|rat|This extraordinary Black and Tan has won 50 interesting events, including the following matches
Rat-baiting|rat|2 matches of 6 rats when he weighed 4 1/2 pounds, 20 matches of 12 rats at 5 pounds of weight, 15 matches of 20 rats at 5-pound weight, 1 match of 50 rats ands 1 match of 100 rats in 34 minutes 40 seconds on Tuesday, March 30, 1847
Rat-baiting|rat|"Tiny beat Summertown bitch ""Crack"" of 8 pounds, 12 Rats each, September 14th"
Rat-baiting|rat|"Beat the dog ""Twig"" at 6 1/2 pounds on November 7th"
Rat-baiting|rat|On Tuesday, March 28, 1848, he was matched to kill 300 rats in 3 hours
Rat-baiting|rat|He accomplished the unprecedented test in 54 minutes 50 seconds, which took place in the presence of a crowded audience at the Blue Anchor, Bonhill Row, St
Rat-baiting|rat|Lukes
Rat-baiting|rat|May 2, killed 20 rats in 8 minutes; May 23 won a match of 50 rats against Mr
Rat-baiting|rat|"Batty's bitch ""Fun,"" 8 pounds"
Rat-baiting|rat|"August 15, won a match against ""Jim,"" 50 rats; September 5 won a match of 12 rats, 2 minutes 30 seconds"
Rat-baiting|rat|"November 4 won a match of 100 rats, 30 minutes 5 seconds; January 31, 1849, won a match of 100 rats, 20 minutes 5 seconds; March 27 killed 200 rats 59 minutes 58 seconds."""
Rat-baiting|rat|Jack was a Black and Tan Terrier owned by Kit Burns in New York City in the mid- to late 19th century
Rat-baiting|rat|Jack was a prized ratter, and Burns claimed that Jack killed 100 rats in 5 minutes and 40 seconds
Rat-baiting|rat|Burns had Jack taxidermied and mounted him, alongside other prized dogs, on the bar of his tavern called the Sportsmen's Hall, located at 273 Water Street
Rat-baiting|rat|Burns' first-floor amphitheatre could hold 100 spectators who were charged an admission of $1.50 to $5.00 depending on the dogs' quality, nearly a skilled labourer's daily wages
Rat-baiting|rat|The rat pit was about 8 ft square with 4-ft-high walls
Rat-baiting|rat|On the New York City waterfront rat baiting was quite lucrative with a purse of $125 not uncommon
Rat-baiting|rat|This created a high demand for rats with some rat catchers earning $0.05 to $0.12 per rat.Kit Burns' rat-pit activities are described by author James Dabney McCabe in his book Secrets of the Great City,  published in 1868, at page 388, as follows:
Rat-baiting|rat|"""Rats are plentiful along the East River and Burns has no difficulty in procuring as many as he desires"
Rat-baiting|rat|These and his dogs furnish the entertainment in which he delights
Rat-baiting|rat|The principal room of the house is arranged as an amphitheatre
Rat-baiting|rat|The seats are rough wooden benches and in the centre is a ring or pit enclosed by a circular wooden fence several feet high
Rat-baiting|rat|A number of rats are turned into this pit and a dog of the best ferret stock is thrown in amongst them
Rat-baiting|rat|The little creature at once falls to work to kill the rats, bets being made that she will destroy, so many rats in a given time
Rat-baiting|rat|The time is generally made by the little animal who is well known to and a great favorite with the yelling blasphemous wretches who line the benches
Rat-baiting|rat|The performance is greeted with shouts oaths and other frantic demonstrations of delight
Rat-baiting|rat|Some of the men will catch up the dog in their arms and press it to their bosom in a frenzy of joy or kiss it as if it were a human being unmindful or careless of the fact that all this while the animal is smeared with the blood of its victims
Rat-baiting|rat|"The scene is disgusting beyond description.""On November 31, 1870, Henry Bergh the founder of the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals raided the Sportsman's Hall and arrested Burns under an anti-cruelty to animals law passed by the New York state legislature four years prior"
Rat-baiting|rat|The Sportsman Hall stayed permanently closed after the raid.
Rat-baiting|rat|Although little of the original structure remains, Sportsman's Hall occupied the land where the Joseph Rose House and Shop, a four-unit luxury apartment house, now lies and is the third oldest house in Manhattan after St
Rat-baiting|rat|Paul's Chapel and the Morris-Jumel Mansion.
Rat-baiting|rat|Toward the latter half of Queen Victoria's reign, criticism on the practice mounted
Rat-baiting|rat|The animal welfare movement opposed the practice much like they did other forms of animal baiting
Rat-baiting|rat|More favourable ideas of rats as living animals rather than vermin arose, alongside a new interest in their positive role in the maintenance of an urban ecosystem
Rat-baiting|rat|(It was only after the decline of rat baiting that rats became associated with the spread of disease.) Additionally, when ratting moved from being a countryside pastime to the betting arena's of inner London, it became associated with the base vices of lower-class citizens
Rat-baiting|rat|Baiting sports diminished in popularity and the dog exhibition shows brought by the gentry slowly replaced the attraction as a more enlightened form of animal entertainment.The last public competition in the United Kingdom took place in Leicester in 1912
Rat-baiting|rat|The owner was prosecuted and fined, and had to give a promise to the court that he would never again promote such entertainment.
Rat-baiting|rat|Ratting and rat-baiting are not the same activities
Rat-baiting|rat|Ratting is the legal use of dogs for pest control of non-captured rats in an unconfined space, such as a barn or field
Rat-baiting|rat|Due to rat infestations, terriers are now being used for ratting to hunt and kill rats in major cities around the world, including the United Kingdom, the United States and Vietnam
Rat-baiting|rat|Although ratting with working terriers is far less efficient than using rodenticide or rat traps, the potential for the killing of nontarget species is zero.
Rat-baiting|rat|In the movie Gangs of New York (2002), a scene involves rat baiting.In the book Let Loose the Dogs (2003) by Maureen Jennings, as well as it's TV adaptation, the main storyline is that a murder occurred following a rat-baiting contest.In Season 1, Episode 4 of The Knick (2014), there is a scene depicting rat baiting
Rat-baiting|rat|A human, rather than a dog, is the one in the pit with the rats.

Rat king|rat|A rat king is a collection of rats whose tails are intertwined and bound together by one of several possible mechanisms, such as entangling material like hair or sticky substances like sap or gum or getting tied together
Rat king|rat|Historically, this phenomenon is particularly associated with Germany
Rat king|rat|There are several specimens preserved in museums but very few instances of rat kings have been observed in modern times.
Rat king|rat|The original German term, Rattenkönig, was calqued into English as rat king, and into French as roi des rats
Rat king|rat|The term was not originally used in reference to actual rats, but for persons who lived off others
Rat king|rat|Conrad Gesner in Historia animalium (1551–58) stated
Rat king|rat|"""Some would have it that the rat waxes mighty in its old age and is fed by its young"
Rat king|rat|"this is called the rat king."" Martin Luther stated"
Rat king|rat|"""finally, there is the Pope, the king of rats right at the top."" Later, the term referred to a king sitting on a throne of knotted tails.An alternative theory states that the name in French was rouet de rats (or a spinning wheel of rats, the knotted tails being wheel spokes), with the term transforming over time into roi des rats, because formerly French oi was pronounced [we] or similar; nowadays it is pronounced [wa]."
Rat king|rat|The earliest report of rat kings comes from 1564
Rat king|rat|Most extant examples are formed from black rats (Rattus rattus).Specimens of purported rat kings are kept in some museums
Rat king|rat|"The museum Mauritianum in Altenburg, Thuringia, shows the largest well-known mummified ""rat king"", which was found in 1828 in a miller's fireplace at Buchheim"
Rat king|rat|It consists of 32 rats
Rat king|rat|Alcohol-preserved rat kings are shown in museums in Hamburg, Göttingen, Hamelin, Stuttgart, Strasbourg and Nantes.
Rat king|rat|A rat king found in 1930 in New Zealand, displayed in the Otago Museum in Dunedin, was composed of immature black rats whose tails were entangled by horse hair.A rat king discovered in 1963 by a farmer at Rucphen, Netherlands, as published by cryptozoologist M
Rat king|rat|Schneider, consists of seven rats
Rat king|rat|All of them were killed by the time they were examined
Rat king|rat|X-ray images show formations of callus at the fractures of their tails, which suggests that the animals survived for an extended period of time with their tails tangled.Sightings of the phenomenon in modern times, especially where the specimens are alive, are very rare
Rat king|rat|One 2005 sighting comes from an Estonian farmer in Saru, of the Võrumaa region; many of the rats in the specimen, now part of the collection at the University of Tartu Museum of Zoology in Estonia, were alive
Rat king|rat|"In 2021, a living ""rat king"" of five mice was caught on video (and untangled to save the mice) near Stavropol, Russia.On October 20, 2021, a live rat king of 13 rats was found in Põlvamaa, Estonia"
Rat king|rat|This was the first live specimen found
Rat king|rat|The rat king was brought to Tartu University and humanely euthanized because the rats had no way of freeing themselves
Rat king|rat|Before that, scientists were able to film the alive rat king
Rat king|rat|The rat king will be added to the Tartu University Museum of Zoology collection.Besides the Estonian specimen, post-2000, squirrel king instances have been reported
Rat king|rat|Found alive in both cases, veterinarians had to separate them since they were potentially fatally stuck together else they could starve or be eaten by a predator
Rat king|rat|"A ""squirrel king"" of six squirrels stuck together with pine sap was also found in Regina, Saskatchewan, Canada in June 2013"
Rat king|rat|In 2018 five juvenile grey squirrels were found in Wisconsin, US
Rat king|rat|Some surrounding nest material, grass, and plastic got further entangled with them
Rat king|rat|The knot caused some tissue damage to their tails.
Rat king|rat|Rat kings have been reported from Germany, Belgium, Estonia, Java, and New Zealand, with the majority of cases reported from the European countries
Rat king|rat|The existence of this phenomenon is debated due to the limited evidence of it occurring naturally
Rat king|rat|Another concern is the possibility that some of the centuries-old preserved museum specimens could be fabricated, such hoaxes being common in earlier eras
Rat king|rat|17th–18th-century naturalists proposed many hypotheses to explain this phenomenon
Rat king|rat|Most were dubious, ranging from the rats getting stuck together during birth and glued later, to healthy rats deliberately knotting themselves to weaker rats to make a nest
Rat king|rat|A possible explanation is that the long flexible tail of the black rat could be exposed to sticky or frozen substances such as sebum (a secretion from the skin itself), sap, food, or excretory products
Rat king|rat|This mixture acts as a bonding agent and may solidify as rats sleep especially when the animals live in proximity during winter
Rat king|rat|After realizing that they were bound, they would struggle, tightening the knot
Rat king|rat|This explanation is plausible given that most cases have been found during winter and in confined spaces
Rat king|rat|"Emma Burns, curator of natural science at the Otago Museum, said regarding her museum's specimen, ""Ship rats [black rats], according to some theories, are climbing rats, so their tails have … a grasping reflex"
Rat king|rat|"In the nest, they form a hold.""Some zoologists remain skeptical, saying that, while theoretically possible, the rats would not be able to survive in such a condition for a long time, particularly if the temperatures rose or if they bit their own or another's tail to try to free themselves"
Rat king|rat|Since black rats cluster together during winters for warmth, it could be possible for a rat king to be naturally-occurring
Rat king|rat|Any fabrications would most likely have been created using dead rats, given how difficult the process would be if the rats were alive
Rat king|rat|Proper observation of the phenomenon, under scientific scrutiny, occurring naturally with live rats from the start till the end, has yet to happen
Rat king|rat|However, experts support the idea of isolated freak accidents due to the existence of occasional well-observed cases involving squirrels—also members of the rodent family
Rat king|rat|A 2007 study published in Proceedings of the Estonian Academy of Science, Biology, and Ecology, following the finding of the University of Tartu specimen, concluded that the phenomenon is possible but rare.
Rat king|rat|Rat kings appear in novels such as It by Stephen King, Accordion Crimes by Annie Proulx, The Tale of One Bad Rat by Bryan Talbot, Ratking by Michael Dibdin, Rotters by Daniel Kraus, Peeps by Scott Westerfeld, The Haunting of Alaizabel Cray by Chris Wooding, Rats and Gargoyles by Mary Gentle, Luther

Rat king|rat|In Alan Moore and Ian Gibson's comic book series The Ballad of Halo Jones, the Rat King was a weapon of war, a super-intelligent collective able to coordinate attacks by regular rats on a global scale, decimating an entire planet.
Rat king|rat|In The Amazing Maurice and his Educated Rodents by Terry Pratchett, Keith skeptically notes that the filth associated with supposedly tying the young rats together at a young age is not found in a rat's nest, and suspects that a rat king is created as a sort of project by a rat catcher himself
Rat king|rat|One rat king, called Spider due to having eight component rats, supports this by his grudge against humanity for his traumatic creation
Rat king|rat|"In an author's note at the end of the novel, Pratchett ventures the theory that ""down the ages, some cruel and inventive people have had altogether too much time on their hands""."

Tiger|tiger|The tiger (Panthera tigris) is the largest living cat species and a member of the genus Panthera
Tiger|tiger|It is most recognisable for its dark vertical stripes on orange fur with a white underside
Tiger|tiger|An apex predator, it primarily preys on ungulates such as deer and wild boar
Tiger|tiger|It is territorial and generally a solitary but social predator, requiring large contiguous areas of habitat, which support its requirements for prey and rearing of its offspring
Tiger|tiger|Tiger cubs stay with their mother for about two years, then become independent and leave their mother's home range to establish their own.
Tiger|tiger|The tiger was first scientifically described in 1758 and once ranged widely from the Eastern Anatolia Region in the west to the Amur River basin in the east, and in the south from the foothills of the Himalayas to Bali in the Sunda Islands
Tiger|tiger|Since the early 20th century, tiger populations have lost at least 93% of their historic range and have been extirpated from Western and Central Asia, the islands of Java and Bali, and in large areas of Southeast and South Asia and China
Tiger|tiger|Today, the tiger's range is fragmented, stretching from Siberian temperate forests to subtropical and tropical forests on the Indian subcontinent, Indochina and Sumatra.
Tiger|tiger|The tiger is listed as Endangered on the IUCN Red List
Tiger|tiger|As of 2015, the global wild tiger population was estimated to number between 3,062 and 3,948 mature individuals, with most of the populations living in small isolated pockets
Tiger|tiger|India currently hosts the largest tiger population
Tiger|tiger|Major reasons for population decline are habitat destruction, habitat fragmentation and poaching
Tiger|tiger|Tigers are also victims of human–wildlife conflict, particularly in range countries with a high human population density.
Tiger|tiger|The tiger is among the most recognisable and popular of the world's charismatic megafauna
Tiger|tiger|It featured prominently in the ancient mythology and folklore of cultures throughout its historic range, and continues to be depicted in modern films and literature, appearing on many flags, coats of arms and as mascots for sporting teams
Tiger|tiger|The tiger is the national animal of India, Bangladesh, Malaysia and South Korea.
Tiger|tiger|The Middle English tigre and Old English tigras derive from Old French tigre, from Latin tigris
Tiger|tiger|In 1758, Carl Linnaeus described the tiger in his work Systema Naturae and gave it the scientific name Felis tigris
Tiger|tiger|In 1929, the British taxonomist Reginald Innes Pocock subordinated the species under the genus Panthera using the scientific name Panthera tigris.
Tiger|tiger|Following Linnaeus's first descriptions of the species, several tiger specimens were described and proposed as subspecies
Tiger|tiger|The validity of several tiger subspecies was questioned in 1999
Tiger|tiger|Most putative subspecies described in the 19th and 20th centuries were distinguished on basis of fur length and colouration, striping patterns and body size, hence characteristics that vary widely within populations
Tiger|tiger|Morphologically, tigers from different regions vary little, and gene flow between populations in those regions is considered to have been possible during the Pleistocene
Tiger|tiger|Therefore, it was proposed to recognize only two tiger subspecies as valid, namely P
Tiger|tiger|t
Tiger|tiger|tigris in mainland Asia, and P
Tiger|tiger|t
Tiger|tiger|sondaica in the Greater Sunda Islands.Results of craniological analysis of 111 tiger skulls from Southeast Asian range countries indicate that Sumatran tiger skulls differ from Indochinese and Javan tiger skulls, whereas Bali tiger skulls are similar in size to Javan tiger skulls
Tiger|tiger|The authors proposed to classify the Sumatran and Javan tigers as distinct species, P
Tiger|tiger|sumatrae and P
Tiger|tiger|sondaica, with the Bali tiger as subspecies P
Tiger|tiger|sondaica balica.In 2015, morphological, ecological, and molecular traits of all putative tiger subspecies were analysed in a combined approach
Tiger|tiger|Results support distinction of the two evolutionary groups continental and Sunda tigers
Tiger|tiger|The authors proposed recognition of only two subspecies, namely P
Tiger|tiger|t
Tiger|tiger|tigris comprising the Bengal, Malayan, Indochinese, South Chinese, Siberian and Caspian tiger populations, and P
Tiger|tiger|t
Tiger|tiger|sondaica comprising the Javan, Bali and Sumatran tiger populations
Tiger|tiger|The authors also noted that this reclassification will affect tiger conservation management
Tiger|tiger|The nominate subspecies P
Tiger|tiger|t
Tiger|tiger|tigris constitutes two clades:
Tiger|tiger|a southern clade composed of all other mainland populations.One conservation specialist welcomed this proposal as it would make captive breeding programmes and future rewilding of zoo-born tigers easier
Tiger|tiger|One geneticist was sceptical of this study and maintained that the currently recognised nine subspecies can be distinguished genetically.In 2017, the Cat Classification Task Force of the IUCN Cat Specialist Group revised felid taxonomy and recognized the tiger populations in continental Asia as P
Tiger|tiger|t
Tiger|tiger|tigris, and those in the Sunda Islands as P
Tiger|tiger|t
Tiger|tiger|sondaica
Tiger|tiger|This two-subspecies view has been largely rejected by researchers
Tiger|tiger|Results of a 2018 whole-genome sequencing of 32 specimens support six monophyletic tiger clades corresponding with the living subspecies and indicate that the most recent common ancestor lived about 110,000 years ago.
Tiger|tiger|The following tables are based on the classification of the species Panthera tigris provided in Mammal Species of the World
Tiger|tiger|It also reflects the classification used by the Cat Classification Task Force in 2017:
Tiger|tiger|The tiger's closest living relatives were previously thought to be the Panthera species lion, leopard and jaguar
Tiger|tiger|Results of genetic analysis indicate that about 2.88 million years ago, the tiger and the snow leopard lineages diverged from the other Panthera species, and that both may be more closely related to each other than to the lion, leopard and jaguar.
Tiger|tiger|The geographic origin of the Panthera is most likely northern Central Asia
Tiger|tiger|The tiger–snow leopard lineage dispersed in Southeast Asia during the Miocene.Panthera zdanskyi is considered to be a sister taxon of the modern tiger
Tiger|tiger|It lived at the beginning of the Pleistocene about two million years ago, its fossil remains were excavated in Gansu of northwestern China
Tiger|tiger|"It was smaller and more ""primitive"", but functionally and ecologically similar to the modern tiger"
Tiger|tiger|It is disputed as to whether it had the striping pattern
Tiger|tiger|Northwestern China is thought to be the origin of the tiger lineage
Tiger|tiger|Tigers grew in size, possibly in response to adaptive radiations of prey species like deer and bovids, which may have occurred in Southeast Asia during the Early Pleistocene.Panthera tigris trinilensis lived about 1.2 million years ago and is known from fossils excavated near Trinil in Java
Tiger|tiger|The Wanhsien, Ngandong, Trinil, and Japanese tigers became extinct in prehistoric times
Tiger|tiger|Tigers reached India and northern Asia in the late Pleistocene, reaching eastern Beringia, Japan, and Sakhalin
Tiger|tiger|Some fossil skulls are morphologically distinct from lion skulls, which could indicate tiger presence in Alaska during the last glacial period, about 100,000 years ago.In the Ille Cave on the island of Palawan, two articulated phalanx bones were found amidst an assemblage of other animal bones and stone tools
Tiger|tiger|They were smaller than mainland tiger fossils, possibly due to insular dwarfism
Tiger|tiger|It has been speculated that the tiger parts were either imported from elsewhere, or that the tiger colonised Palawan from Borneo before the Holocene
Tiger|tiger|Fossil remains of tigers were also excavated in Sri Lanka, China, Japan and Sarawak dating to the Late Pliocene, Pleistocene and Early Holocene
Tiger|tiger|The Bornean tiger was apparently present in Borneo between the Late Pleistocene and the Holocene, but whether it went extinct in prehistoric or recent times has not been resolved.Results of a phylogeographic study indicate that all living tigers had a common ancestor 108,000 to 72,000 years ago
Tiger|tiger|The potential tiger range during the late Pleistocene and Holocene was predicted applying ecological niche modelling based on more than 500 tiger locality records combined with bioclimatic data
Tiger|tiger|The resulting model shows a contiguous tiger range at the Last Glacial Maximum, indicating gene flow between tiger populations in mainland Asia
Tiger|tiger|The Caspian tiger population was likely connected to the Bengal tiger population through corridors below elevations of 4,000 m (13,000 ft) in the Hindu Kush
Tiger|tiger|The tiger populations on the Sunda Islands and mainland Asia were possibly separated during interglacial periods.The tiger's full genome sequence was published in 2013
Tiger|tiger|It was found to have similar repeat composition to other cat genomes and an appreciably conserved synteny.
Tiger|tiger|Captive tigers were bred with lions to create hybrids called liger and tigon
Tiger|tiger|They share physical and behavioural qualities of both parent species
Tiger|tiger|Breeding hybrids is now discouraged due to the emphasis on conservation.
Tiger|tiger|The liger is a cross between a male lion and a tigress
Tiger|tiger|Ligers are typically between 10 and 12 ft (3.0 and 3.7 m) in length, and weigh between 800 and 1,000 lb (360 and 450 kg) or more
Tiger|tiger|Because the lion sire passes on a growth-promoting gene, but the corresponding growth-inhibiting gene from the female tiger is absent, ligers grow far larger than either parent species.The less common tigon is a cross between a lioness and a male tiger
Tiger|tiger|Because the male tiger does not pass on a growth-promoting gene and the lioness passes on a growth inhibiting gene, tigons are around the same size as their parents
Tiger|tiger|Some females are fertile and have occasionally given birth to litigons when mated to a male Asiatic lion.
Tiger|tiger|The tiger has a muscular body with powerful forelimbs, a large head and a tail that is about half the length of its body
Tiger|tiger|Its pelage is dense and heavy, and colouration varies between shades of orange and brown with white ventral areas and distinctive vertical black stripes; the patterns of which are unique in each individual
Tiger|tiger|Stripes are likely advantageous for camouflage in vegetation such as long grass with strong vertical patterns of light and shade
Tiger|tiger|The tiger is one of only a few striped cat species; it is not known why spotted patterns and rosettes are the more common camouflage pattern among felids
Tiger|tiger|The orange colour may also aid in camouflage as the tiger's prey are dichromats, and thus may perceive the cat as green and blended in with the vegetation.A tiger's coat pattern is still visible when it is shaved
Tiger|tiger|This is not due to skin pigmentation, but to the stubble and hair follicles embedded in the skin
Tiger|tiger|It has a mane-like heavy growth of fur around the neck and jaws and long whiskers, especially in males
Tiger|tiger|The pupils are circular with yellow irises
Tiger|tiger|The small, rounded ears have a prominent white spot on the back, surrounded by black
Tiger|tiger|These spots are thought to play an important role in intraspecific communication.The tiger's skull is similar to a lion's skull, with the frontal region usually less depressed or flattened, and a slightly longer postorbital region
Tiger|tiger|The lion skull shows broader nasal openings
Tiger|tiger|Due to the variation in skull sizes of the two species, the structure of the lower jaw is a reliable indicator for their identification
Tiger|tiger|The tiger has fairly stout teeth; its somewhat curved canines are the longest among living felids with a crown height of up to 90 mm (3.5 in).
Tiger|tiger|There is notable sexual dimorphism between male and female tigers, with the latter being consistently smaller
Tiger|tiger|The size difference between them is proportionally greater in the large tiger subspecies, with males weighing up to 1.7 times more than females
Tiger|tiger|Males also have wider forepaw pads, enabling sex to be identified from tracks
Tiger|tiger|It has been hypothesised that body size of different tiger populations may be correlated with climate and be explained by thermoregulation and Bergmann's rule, or by distribution and size of available prey species.Generally, males vary in total length from 250 to 390 cm (8.2 to 12.8 ft) and weigh between 90 and 300 kg (200 and 660 lb) with skull length ranging from 316 to 383 mm (12.4 to 15.1 in)
Tiger|tiger|Females vary in total length from 200 to 275 cm (6.56 to 9.02 ft), weigh 65 to 167 kg (143 to 368 lb) with skull length ranging from 268 to 318 mm (0.879 to 1.043 ft)
Tiger|tiger|In either sex, the tail represents about 0.6 to 1.1 m (24 to 43 in) of the total length
Tiger|tiger|The Bengal and Siberian tigers are amongst the tallest cats in shoulder height
Tiger|tiger|They are also ranked among the biggest cats that have ever existed reaching weights of more than 300 kg (660 lb)
Tiger|tiger|The tigers of the Sunda islands are smaller and less heavy than tigers in mainland Asia, rarely exceeding 142 kg (313 lb) in weight.
Tiger|tiger|There are three other colour variants – white, golden and nearly stripeless snow white – that are now virtually non-existent in the wild due to the reduction of wild tiger populations, but continue in captive populations
Tiger|tiger|The white tiger has white fur and sepia-brown stripes
Tiger|tiger|The golden tiger has a pale golden pelage with a blond tone and reddish-brown stripes
Tiger|tiger|The snow white tiger is a morph with extremely faint stripes and a pale reddish-brown ringed tail
Tiger|tiger|Both snow white and golden tigers are homozygous for CORIN gene mutations
Tiger|tiger|A black tiger is a colour variant due to pseudo-melanism
Tiger|tiger|They have thick stripes close together so that the background colour is barely visible between stripes.The white tiger lacks pheomelanin (which creates the orange colour), and has dark sepia-brown stripes and blue eyes
Tiger|tiger|This altered pigmentation is caused by a mutant gene that is inherited as an autosomal recessive trait, which is determined by a white locus
Tiger|tiger|It is not an albino, as the dark pigments are scarcely affected
Tiger|tiger|The mutation changes a single amino acid in the transporter protein SLC45A2
Tiger|tiger|Both parents need to have the allele for whiteness to have white cubs.
Tiger|tiger|Between the early and mid 20th century, white tigers were recorded and shot in the Indian states of Odisha, Bihar, Assam and in the area of Rewa, Madhya Pradesh
Tiger|tiger|The local maharaja started breeding tigers in the early 1950s and kept a white male tiger together with its normal-coloured daughter; they had white cubs.
Tiger|tiger|To preserve this recessive trait, only a few white individuals were used in captive breeding, which led to a high degree of inbreeding
Tiger|tiger|Inbreeding depression is the main reason for many health problems of captive white tigers, including strabismus, stillbirth, deformities and premature death.
Tiger|tiger|Other physical defects include cleft palate and scoliosis.The Tiger Species Survival Plan has condemned the breeding of white tigers, alleging they are of mixed ancestry and of unknown lineage
Tiger|tiger|The genes responsible for white colouration are represented by 0.001% of the population
Tiger|tiger|The disproportionate growth in numbers of white tigers points to inbreeding among homozygous recessive individuals
Tiger|tiger|This would lead to inbreeding depression and loss of genetic variability.
Tiger|tiger|The tiger historically ranged from eastern Turkey and Transcaucasia to the coast of the Sea of Japan, and from South Asia across Southeast Asia to the Indonesian islands of Sumatra, Java and Bali
Tiger|tiger|Since the end of the last glacial period, it was probably restricted by periods of deep snow lasting longer than six months
Tiger|tiger|Currently, it occurs in less than 6% of its historical range, as it has been extirpated from Southwest and Central Asia, large parts of Southeast and East Asia
Tiger|tiger|It now mainly occurs in the Indian subcontinent, the Indochinese Peninsula, Sumatra and the Russian Far East
Tiger|tiger|In China and Myanmar, breeding populations appear to rely on immigration from neighbouring countries while its status in the Korean Peninsula is unknown.The tiger is essentially associated with forest habitats
Tiger|tiger|Tiger populations thrive where populations of wild cervids, bovids and suids are stable.
Tiger|tiger|Records in Central Asia indicate that it occurred foremost in Tugay riverine forests along the Atrek, Amu Darya, Syr Darya, Hari, Chu and Ili Rivers and their tributaries
Tiger|tiger|In the Caucasus, it inhabited hilly and lowland forests.
Tiger|tiger|Historical records in Iran are known only from the southern coast of the Caspian Sea and adjacent Alborz Mountains
Tiger|tiger|In the Amur-Ussuri region, it inhabits Korean pine and temperate broadleaf and mixed forests, where riparian forests provide food and water, and serve as dispersal corridors for both tiger and ungulates.
Tiger|tiger|On the Indian subcontinent, it inhabits mainly tropical and subtropical moist broadleaf forests, moist evergreen forests, tropical dry forests and the swamp forests of the Sundarbans
Tiger|tiger|In the Eastern Himalayas, tigers were documented in temperate forest up to an elevation of 4,200 m (13,800 ft) in Bhutan and of 3,630 m (11,910 ft) in the Mishmi Hills
Tiger|tiger|In Thailand, it lives in deciduous and evergreen forests
Tiger|tiger|In Laos, 14 tigers were documented in semi-evergreen and evergreen forest interspersed with grassland in Nam Et-Phou Louey National Protected Area during surveys from 2013 to 2017
Tiger|tiger|In Sumatra, tiger populations range from lowland peat swamp forests to rugged montane forests.
Tiger|tiger|When not subject to human disturbance, the tiger is mainly diurnal
Tiger|tiger|It does not often climb trees but cases have been recorded
Tiger|tiger|It is a strong swimmer and often bathes in ponds, lakes and rivers, thus keeping cool in the heat of the day
Tiger|tiger|Individuals can cross rivers up to 7 km (4.3 mi) wide and can swim up to 29 km (18 mi) in a day
Tiger|tiger|During the 1980s, a tiger was observed frequently hunting prey through deep lake water in Ranthambhore National Park.The tiger is a long-ranging species, and individuals disperse over distances of up to 650 km (400 mi) to reach tiger populations in other areas
Tiger|tiger|Radio-collared tigers in Chitwan National Park started dispersing from their natal areas earliest at the age of 19 months
Tiger|tiger|Four females dispersed between 0 and 43.2 km (0.0 and 26.8 mi), and 10 males between 9.5 and 65.7 km (5.9 and 40.8 mi)
Tiger|tiger|None of them crossed open cultivated areas that were more than 10 km (6.2 mi) wide, but moved through forested habitat.Adult tigers lead largely solitary lives
Tiger|tiger|They establish and maintain territories but have much wider home ranges within which they roam
Tiger|tiger|Resident adults of either sex generally confine their movements to their home ranges, within which they satisfy their needs and those of their growing cubs
Tiger|tiger|Individuals sharing the same area are aware of each other's movements and activities
Tiger|tiger|The size of the home range mainly depends on prey abundance, geographic area and sex of the individual
Tiger|tiger|In India, home ranges appear to be 50 to 1,000 km2 (19 to 386 sq mi) while in Manchuria, they range from 500 to 4,000 km2 (190 to 1,540 sq mi)
Tiger|tiger|In Nepal, defended territories are recorded to be 19 to 151 km2 (7.3 to 58.3 sq mi) for males and 10 to 51 km2 (3.9 to 19.7 sq mi) for females.Young female tigers establish their first territories close to their mother's
Tiger|tiger|The overlap between the female and her mother's territory reduces with time
Tiger|tiger|Males, however, migrate further than their female counterparts and set out at a younger age to mark out their own area
Tiger|tiger|A young male acquires territory either by seeking out an area devoid of other male tigers, or by living as a transient in another male's territory until he is older and strong enough to challenge the resident male
Tiger|tiger|Young males seeking to establish themselves thereby comprise the highest mortality rate (30–35% per year) amongst adult tigers.To identify his territory, the male marks trees by spraying urine, anal gland secretions, marking trails with feces and marking trees or the ground with their claws
Tiger|tiger|"Females also use these ""scrapes"", urine and fecal markings"
Tiger|tiger|Scent markings of this type allow an individual to pick up information on another's identity, sex and reproductive status
Tiger|tiger|Females in oestrus will signal their availability by scent marking more frequently and increasing their vocalisations.Although for the most part avoiding each other, tigers are not always territorial and relationships between individuals can be complex
Tiger|tiger|An adult of either sex will sometimes share its kill with others, even those who may not be related to them
Tiger|tiger|George Schaller observed a male share a kill with two females and four cubs
Tiger|tiger|Unlike male lions, male tigers allow females and cubs to feed on the kill before the male is finished with it; all involved generally seem to behave amicably, in contrast to the competitive behaviour shown by a lion pride
Tiger|tiger|Stephen Mills described a social feeding event in Ranthambore National Park:
Tiger|tiger|A dominant tigress they called Padmini killed a 250 kg (550 lb) male nilgai – a very large antelope
Tiger|tiger|They found her at the kill just after dawn with her three 14-month-old cubs, and they watched uninterrupted for the next ten hours
Tiger|tiger|During this period the family was joined by two adult females and one adult male, all offspring from Padmini's previous litters, and by two unrelated tigers, one female the other unidentified
Tiger|tiger|By three o'clock there were no fewer than nine tigers round the kill.
Tiger|tiger|Male tigers are generally more intolerant of other males within their territories than females are of other females
Tiger|tiger|Territory disputes are usually solved by displays of intimidation rather than outright aggression
Tiger|tiger|Several such incidents have been observed in which the subordinate tiger yielded defeat by rolling onto its back and showing its belly in a submissive posture
Tiger|tiger|Once dominance has been established, a male may tolerate a subordinate within his range, as long as they do not live in too close quarters
Tiger|tiger|The most aggressive disputes tend to occur between two males when a female is in oestrus, and sometimes results in the death of one of the males.
Tiger|tiger|"Facial expressions include the ""defense threat"", where an individual bares its teeth, flattens its ears and its pupils enlarge"
Tiger|tiger|Both males and females show a flehmen response, a characteristic grimace, when sniffing urine markings, but flehmen is more often associated with males detecting the markings made by tigresses in oestrus
Tiger|tiger|Like other Panthera, tigers roar, particularly in aggressive situations, during the mating season or when making a kill
Tiger|tiger|There are two different roars
Tiger|tiger|"the ""true"" roar is made using the hyoid apparatus and forced through an open mouth as it progressively closes, and the shorter, harsher ""coughing"" roar is made with the mouth open and teeth exposed"
Tiger|tiger|"The ""true"" roar can be heard at up to 3 km (1.9 mi) away and is sometimes emitted three or four times in succession"
Tiger|tiger|When tense, tigers will moan, a sound similar to a roar but more subdued and made when the mouth is partially or completely closed
Tiger|tiger|Moaning can be heard 400 m (1,300 ft) away
Tiger|tiger|Chuffing—soft, low-frequency snorting similar to purring in smaller cats—is heard in more friendly situations
Tiger|tiger|Other vocal communications include grunts, woofs, snarls, miaows, hisses and growls.
Tiger|tiger|In the wild, tigers mostly feed on large and medium-sized mammals, particularly ungulates weighing 60–250 kg (130–550 lb)
Tiger|tiger|The most significantly preferred species are sambar deer, wapiti, barasingha and wild boar
Tiger|tiger|Tigers are capable of taking down larger prey like adult gaur but will also opportunistically eat much smaller prey, such as monkeys, peafowl and other ground-based birds, hares, porcupines, and fish
Tiger|tiger|They also prey on other predators, including dogs, leopards, pythons, bears, and crocodiles
Tiger|tiger|Tigers generally do not prey on fully grown adult Asian elephants and Indian rhinoceros but incidents have been reported
Tiger|tiger|More often, it is the more vulnerable small calves that are taken
Tiger|tiger|When in close proximity to humans, tigers will also sometimes prey on such domestic livestock as cattle, horses, and donkeys
Tiger|tiger|Although almost exclusively carnivorous, tigers will occasionally eat vegetation for dietary fibre such as fruit of the slow match tree.
Tiger|tiger|Tigers are thought to be mainly nocturnal predators, but in areas where humans are absent, remote-controlled, hidden camera traps recorded them hunting in daylight
Tiger|tiger|They generally hunt alone and ambush their prey as most other cats do, overpowering them from any angle, using their body size and strength to knock the prey off balance
Tiger|tiger|Successful hunts usually require the tiger to almost simultaneously leap onto its quarry, knock it over, and grab the throat or nape with its teeth
Tiger|tiger|Despite their large size, tigers can reach speeds of about 49–65 km/h (30–40 mph) but only in short bursts; consequently, tigers must be close to their prey before they break cover
Tiger|tiger|If the prey senses the tiger's presence before this, the tiger usually abandons the hunt rather than chase prey or battle it head-on
Tiger|tiger|Horizontal leaps of up to 10 m (33 ft) have been reported, although leaps of around half this distance are more typical
Tiger|tiger|One in 2 to 20 hunts, including stalking near potential prey, ends in a successful kill.
Tiger|tiger|When hunting larger animals, tigers prefer to bite the throat and use their powerful forelimbs to hold onto the prey, often simultaneously wrestling it to the ground
Tiger|tiger|The tiger remains latched onto the neck until its target dies of strangulation
Tiger|tiger|By this method, gaurs and water buffaloes weighing over a ton have been killed by tigers weighing about a sixth as much
Tiger|tiger|Although they can kill healthy adults, tigers often select the calves or infirm of very large species
Tiger|tiger|Healthy adult prey of this type can be dangerous to tackle, as long, strong horns, legs and tusks are all potentially fatal to the tiger
Tiger|tiger|No other extant land predator routinely takes on prey this large on its own.With smaller prey, such as monkeys and hares, the tiger bites the nape, often breaking the spinal cord, piercing the windpipe, or severing the jugular vein or common carotid artery
Tiger|tiger|Though rarely observed, some tigers have been recorded to kill prey by swiping with their paws, which are powerful enough to smash the skulls of domestic cattle, and break the backs of sloth bears.After killing their prey, tigers sometimes drag it to conceal it in vegetative cover, usually pulling it by grasping with their mouths at the site of the killing bite
Tiger|tiger|This, too, can require great physical strength
Tiger|tiger|In one case, after it had killed an adult gaur, a tiger was observed to drag the massive carcass over a distance of 12 m (39 ft)
Tiger|tiger|When 13 men simultaneously tried to drag the same carcass later, they were unable to move it
Tiger|tiger|An adult tiger can go for up to two weeks without eating, then gorge on 34 kg (75 lb) of flesh at one time
Tiger|tiger|In captivity, adult tigers are fed 3 to 6 kg (6.6 to 13.2 lb) of meat a day.
Tiger|tiger|Tigers usually prefer to eat self-killed prey, but eat carrion in times of scarcity and also steal prey from other large carnivores
Tiger|tiger|Although predators typically avoid one another, if a prey item is under dispute or a serious competitor is encountered, displays of aggression are common
Tiger|tiger|If these are not sufficient, the conflicts may turn violent; tigers may kill or even prey on competitors such as leopards, dholes, striped hyenas, wolves, bears, pythons, and mugger crocodiles on occasion
Tiger|tiger|Attacks on smaller predators, such as badgers, lynxes, and foxes, are almost certainly predatory
Tiger|tiger|Crocodiles, bears, and large packs of dholes may win conflicts against tigers and, in the cases of crocodiles and bears, even can kill them.The considerably smaller leopard avoids competition from tigers by hunting at different times of the day and hunting different prey
Tiger|tiger|In India's Nagarhole National Park, most prey selected by leopards were from 30 to 175 kg (66 to 386 lb) against a preference for prey weighing over 176 kg (388 lb) in the tigers
Tiger|tiger|The average prey weight in the two respective big cats in India was 37.6 kg (83 lb) against 91.5 kg (202 lb)
Tiger|tiger|With relatively abundant prey, tigers and leopards were seen to successfully coexist without competitive exclusion or interspecies dominance hierarchies that may be more common to the African savanna, where the leopard exists with the lion
Tiger|tiger|Golden jackals may feed on the tiger's kills
Tiger|tiger|Tigers appear to inhabit the deep parts of a forest while smaller predators like leopards and dholes are pushed closer to the fringes.
Tiger|tiger|The tiger mates all year round, but most cubs are born between March and June, with a second peak in September
Tiger|tiger|Gestation ranges from 93 to 114 days, with an average of 103 to 105 days
Tiger|tiger|A female is only receptive for three to six days
Tiger|tiger|Mating is frequent and noisy during that time
Tiger|tiger|The female gives birth in a sheltered location such as in tall grass, in a dense thicket, cave or rocky crevice
Tiger|tiger|The father generally takes no part in rearing
Tiger|tiger|Litters consist of two or three cubs, rarely as many as six
Tiger|tiger|Cubs weigh from 780 to 1,600 g (1.72 to 3.53 lb) each at birth, and are born with eyes closed
Tiger|tiger|They open their eyes when they are six to 14 days old
Tiger|tiger|Their milk teeth break through at the age of about two weeks
Tiger|tiger|They start to eat meat at the age of eight weeks
Tiger|tiger|At around this time, females usually shift them to a new den
Tiger|tiger|They make short ventures with their mother, although they do not travel with her as she roams her territory until they are older
Tiger|tiger|Females lactate for five to six months
Tiger|tiger|Around the time they are weaned, they start to accompany their mother on territorial walks and are taught how to hunt.A dominant cub emerges in most litters, usually a male
Tiger|tiger|The dominant cub is more active than its siblings and takes the lead in their play, eventually leaving its mother and becoming independent earlier
Tiger|tiger|The cubs start hunting on their own earliest at the age of 11 months, and become independent around 18 to 20 months of age
Tiger|tiger|They separate from their mother at the age of two to two and a half years, but continue to grow until the age of five years
Tiger|tiger|Young females reach sexual maturity at three to four years, whereas males at four to five years
Tiger|tiger|Unrelated wandering male tigers often kill cubs to make the female receptive, since the tigress may give birth to another litter within five months if the cubs of the previous litter are lost
Tiger|tiger|The mortality rate of tiger cubs is about 50% in the first two years
Tiger|tiger|Few other predators attack tiger cubs due to the diligence and ferocity of the mother
Tiger|tiger|Apart from humans and other tigers, common causes of cub mortality are starvation, freezing, and accidents
Tiger|tiger|Generation length of the tiger is about eight years.
Tiger|tiger|The oldest recorded captive tiger lived for 26 years.Occasionally, male tigers participate in raising cubs, usually their own, but this is extremely rare and not always well understood
Tiger|tiger|In May 2015, Amur tigers were photographed by camera traps in the Sikhote-Alin Nature Reserve
Tiger|tiger|The photos show a male Amur tiger pass by, followed by a female and three cubs within the span of about two minutes.
Tiger|tiger|In Ranthambore, a male Bengal tiger raised and defended two orphaned female cubs after their mother had died of illness
Tiger|tiger|The cubs remained under his care, he supplied them with food, protected them from his rival and sister, and apparently also trained them.
Tiger|tiger|In the 1990s, a new approach to tiger conservation was developed
Tiger|tiger|Tiger Conservation Units (TCUs), which are blocks of habitat that have the potential to host tiger populations in 15 habitat types within five bioregions
Tiger|tiger|Altogether 143 TCUs were identified and prioritized based on size and integrity of habitat, poaching pressure and population status
Tiger|tiger|They range in size from 33 to 155,829 km2 (13 to 60,166 sq mi).In 2016, an estimate of a global wild tiger population of approximately 3,890 individuals was presented during the Third Asia Ministerial Conference on Tiger Conservation
Tiger|tiger|The WWF subsequently declared that the world's count of wild tigers had risen for the first time in a century.Major threats to the tiger include habitat destruction, habitat fragmentation and poaching for fur and body parts, which have simultaneously greatly reduced tiger populations in the wild
Tiger|tiger|In India, only 11% of the historical tiger habitat remains due to habitat fragmentation
Tiger|tiger|Demand for tiger parts for use in traditional Chinese medicine has also been cited as a major threat to tiger populations
Tiger|tiger|Some estimates suggest that there are fewer than 2,500 mature breeding individuals, with no subpopulation containing more than 250 mature breeding individuals
Tiger|tiger|The global wild tiger population was estimated by the World Wide Fund for Nature at 3,200 in 2011 and 3,890 in 2015—Vox reported that this was the first increase in a century.India is home to the world's largest population of wild tigers
Tiger|tiger|A 2014 census estimated a population of 2,226, a 30% increase since 2011
Tiger|tiger|On International Tiger Day 2019, the 'Tiger Estimation Report 2018' was released by Prime Minister Narendra Modi
Tiger|tiger|The report estimates a population of 2967 tigers in India with 25% increase since 2014
Tiger|tiger|"Modi said ""India is one of the safest habitats for tigers as it has achieved the target of doubling the tiger population from 1411 in 2011 to 2967 in 2019"".In 1973, India's Project Tiger, started by Indira Gandhi, established numerous tiger reserves"
Tiger|tiger|The project was credited with tripling the number of wild Bengal tigers from some 1,200 in 1973 to over 3,500 in the 1990s, but a 2007 census showed that numbers had dropped back to about 1,400 tigers because of poaching
Tiger|tiger|Following the report, the Indian government pledged $153 million to the initiative, set up measures to combat poaching, promised funds to relocate up to 200,000 villagers in order to reduce human-tiger interactions, and set up eight new tiger reserves
Tiger|tiger|India also reintroduced tigers to the Sariska Tiger Reserve and by 2009 it was claimed that poaching had been effectively countered at Ranthambore National Park.In the 1940s, the Siberian tiger was on the brink of extinction with only about 40 animals remaining in the wild in Russia
Tiger|tiger|As a result, anti-poaching controls were put in place by the Soviet Union and a network of protected zones (zapovedniks) were instituted, leading to a rise in the population to several hundred
Tiger|tiger|Poaching again became a problem in the 1990s, when the economy of Russia collapsed
Tiger|tiger|The major obstacle in preserving the species is the enormous territory individual tigers require (up to 450 km2 needed by a single female and more for a single male)
Tiger|tiger|Current conservation efforts are led by local governments and NGO's in concert with international organisations, such as the World Wide Fund for Nature and the Wildlife Conservation Society
Tiger|tiger|The competitive exclusion of wolves by tigers has been used by Russian conservationists to convince hunters to tolerate the big cats
Tiger|tiger|Tigers have less impact on ungulate populations than do wolves, and are effective in controlling the latter's numbers
Tiger|tiger|In 2005, there were thought to be about 360 animals in Russia, though these exhibited little genetic diversity
Tiger|tiger|However, in a decade later, the Siberian tiger census was estimated from 480 to 540 individuals.In China, tigers became the target of large-scale 'anti-pest' campaigns in the early 1950s, where suitable habitats were fragmented following deforestation and resettlement of people to rural areas, who hunted tigers and prey species
Tiger|tiger|Though tiger hunting was prohibited in 1977, the population continued to decline and is considered extinct in southern China since 2001
Tiger|tiger|Having earlier rejected the Western-led environmentalist movement, China changed its stance in the 1980s and became a party to the CITES treaty
Tiger|tiger|By 1993 it had banned the trade in tiger parts, and this diminished the use of tiger bones in traditional Chinese medicine
Tiger|tiger|The Tibetan people's trade in tiger skins has also been a threat to tigers
Tiger|tiger|The pelts were used in clothing, tiger-skin chuba being worn as fashion
Tiger|tiger|In 2006 the 14th Dalai Lama was persuaded to take up the issue
Tiger|tiger|Since then there has been a change of attitude, with some Tibetans publicly burning their chubas.
Tiger|tiger|In 1994, the Indonesian Sumatran Tiger Conservation Strategy addressed the potential crisis that tigers faced in Sumatra
Tiger|tiger|The Sumatran Tiger Project (STP) was initiated in June 1995 in and around the Way Kambas National Park to ensure the long-term viability of wild Sumatran tigers and to accumulate data on tiger life-history characteristics vital for the management of wild populations
Tiger|tiger|By August 1999, the teams of the STP had evaluated 52 sites of potential tiger habitat in Lampung Province, of which only 15 these were intact enough to contain tigers
Tiger|tiger|In the framework of the STP a community-based conservation programme was initiated to document the tiger-human dimension in the park to enable conservation authorities to resolve tiger-human conflicts based on a comprehensive database rather than anecdotes and opinions.The Wildlife Conservation Society and Panthera Corporation formed the collaboration Tigers Forever, with field sites including the world's largest tiger reserve, the 21,756 km2 (8,400 sq mi) Hukaung Valley in Myanmar
Tiger|tiger|Other reserves were in the Western Ghats in India, Thailand, Laos, Cambodia, the Russian Far East covering in total about 260,000 km2 (100,000 sq mi).Tigers have been studied in the wild using a variety of techniques
Tiger|tiger|Tiger population have been estimated using plaster casts of their pugmarks, although this method was criticized as being inaccurate
Tiger|tiger|More recent techniques include the use of camera traps and studies of DNA from tiger scat, while radio-collaring has been used to track tigers in the wild
Tiger|tiger|Tiger spray has been found to be just as good, or better, as a source of DNA than scat.
Tiger|tiger|The tiger has been one of the big five game animals of Asia
Tiger|tiger|Tiger hunting took place on a large scale in the early 19th and 20th centuries, being a recognised and admired sport by the British in colonial India, the maharajas and aristocratic class of the erstwhile princely states of pre-independence India
Tiger|tiger|A single maharaja or English hunter could claim to kill over a hundred tigers in their hunting career
Tiger|tiger|Tiger hunting was done by some hunters on foot; others sat up on machans with a goat or buffalo tied out as bait; yet others on elephant-back.Historically, tigers have been hunted at a large scale so their famous striped skins could be collected
Tiger|tiger|The trade in tiger skins peaked in the 1960s, just before international conservation efforts took effect
Tiger|tiger|By 1977, a tiger skin in an English market was considered to be worth US$4,250.
Tiger|tiger|Tiger parts are commonly used as amulets in South and Southeast Asia
Tiger|tiger|In the Philippines, the fossils in Palawan were found besides stone tools
Tiger|tiger|This, besides the evidence for cuts on the bones, and the use of fire, suggests that early humans had accumulated the bones, and the condition of the tiger subfossils, dated to approximately 12,000 to 9,000 years ago, differed from other fossils in the assemblage, dated to the Upper Paleolithic
Tiger|tiger|The tiger subfossils showed longitudinal fracture of the cortical bone due to weathering, which suggests that they had post-mortem been exposed to light and air
Tiger|tiger|Tiger canines were found in Ambangan sites dating to the 10th to 12th centuries in Butuan, Mindanao.Many people in China and other parts of Asia have a belief that various tiger parts have medicinal properties, including as pain killers and aphrodisiacs
Tiger|tiger|There is no scientific evidence to support these beliefs
Tiger|tiger|The use of tiger parts in pharmaceutical drugs in China is already banned, and the government has made some offences in connection with tiger poaching punishable by death
Tiger|tiger|Furthermore, all trade in tiger parts is illegal under the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora and a domestic trade ban has been in place in China since 1993.However, the trading of tiger parts in Asia has become a major black market industry and governmental and conservation attempts to stop it have been ineffective to date
Tiger|tiger|Almost all black marketers engaged in the trade are based in China and have either been shipped and sold within in their own country or into Taiwan, South Korea or Japan
Tiger|tiger|The Chinese subspecies was almost completely decimated by killing for commerce due to both the parts and skin trades in the 1950s through the 1970s
Tiger|tiger|Contributing to the illegal trade, there are a number of tiger farms in the country specialising in breeding them for profit
Tiger|tiger|It is estimated that between 5,000 and 10,000 captive-bred, semi-tame animals live in these farms today
Tiger|tiger|However, many tigers for traditional medicine black market are wild ones shot or snared by poachers and may be caught anywhere in the tiger's remaining range (from Siberia to India to the Malay Peninsula to Sumatra)
Tiger|tiger|In the Asian black market, a tiger penis can be worth the equivalent of around $300 U.S
Tiger|tiger|dollars
Tiger|tiger|In the years of 1990 through 1992, 27 million products with tiger derivatives were found
Tiger|tiger|In July 2014 at an international convention on endangered species in Geneva, Switzerland, a Chinese representative admitted for the first time his government was aware trading in tiger skins was occurring in China.
Tiger|tiger|Wild tigers that have had no prior contact with humans actively avoid interactions with them
Tiger|tiger|However, tigers cause more human deaths through direct attack than any other wild mammal
Tiger|tiger|Attacks are occasionally provoked, as tigers lash out after being injured while they themselves are hunted
Tiger|tiger|Attacks can be provoked accidentally, as when a human surprises a tiger or inadvertently comes between a mother and her young, or as in a case in rural India when a postman startled a tiger, used to seeing him on foot, by riding a bicycle
Tiger|tiger|Occasionally tigers come to view people as prey
Tiger|tiger|Such attacks are most common in areas where population growth, logging, and farming have put pressure on tiger habitats and reduced their wild prey
Tiger|tiger|Most man-eating tigers are old, missing teeth, and unable to capture their preferred prey
Tiger|tiger|For example, the Champawat Tiger, a tigress found in Nepal and then India, had two broken canines
Tiger|tiger|She was responsible for an estimated 430 human deaths, the most attacks known to be perpetrated by a single wild animal, by the time she was shot in 1907 by Jim Corbett
Tiger|tiger|According to Corbett, tiger attacks on humans are normally in daytime, when people are working outdoors and are not keeping watch
Tiger|tiger|Early writings tend to describe man-eating tigers as cowardly because of their ambush tactics.Man-eaters have been a particular problem in recent decades in India and Bangladesh, especially in Kumaon, Garhwal and the Sundarbans mangrove swamps of Bengal, where some healthy tigers have hunted humans
Tiger|tiger|Because of rapid habitat loss attributed to climate change, tiger attacks have increased in the Sundarbans
Tiger|tiger|The Sundarbans area had 129 human deaths from tigers from 1969 to 1971
Tiger|tiger|In the 10 years prior to that period, about 100 attacks per year in the Sundarbans, with a high of around 430 in some years of the 1960s
Tiger|tiger|Unusually, in some years in the Sundarbans, more humans are killed by tigers than vice versa
Tiger|tiger|In 1972, India's production of honey and beeswax dropped by 50% when at least 29 people who gathered these materials were devoured
Tiger|tiger|In 1986 in the Sundarbans, since tigers almost always attack from the rear, masks with human faces were worn on the back of the head, on the theory that tigers usually do not attack if seen by their prey
Tiger|tiger|This decreased the number of attacks only temporarily
Tiger|tiger|All other means to prevent attacks, such as providing more prey or using electrified human dummies, did not work as well.
Tiger|tiger|In Ancient Roman times, tigers were kept in menageries and amphitheatres to be exhibited, trained and paraded, and were often provoked to fight gladiators and other exotic beasts
Tiger|tiger|Since the 17th century, tigers, being rare and ferocious, were sought after to keep at European castles as symbols of their owners' power
Tiger|tiger|Tigers became central zoo and circus exhibits in the 18th century
Tiger|tiger|a tiger could cost up to 4,000 francs in France (for comparison, a professor of the Beaux-Arts at Lyons earned only 3,000 francs a year), or up to $3,500 in the United States, where a lion cost no more than $1,000.In 2007, over 4,000 captive tigers lived in China, of which 3,000 were held by about 20 larger facilities, with the rest held by some 200 smaller facilities
Tiger|tiger|In 2011, 468 facilities in the USA kept 2,884 tigers
Tiger|tiger|Nineteen US states banned private ownership of tigers, fifteen require a license, and sixteen states have no regulation
Tiger|tiger|Genetic ancestry of 105 captive tigers from fourteen countries and regions showed that forty-nine animals belonged distinctly to five subspecies; fifty-two animals had mixed subspecies origins
Tiger|tiger|Many Siberian tigers in zoos today are actually the result of crosses with Bengal tigers.
Tiger|tiger|Tigers and their superlative qualities have been a source of fascination for mankind since ancient times, and they are routinely visible as important cultural and media motifs
Tiger|tiger|They are also considered one of the charismatic megafauna, and are used as the face of conservation campaigns worldwide
Tiger|tiger|In a 2004 online poll conducted by cable television channel Animal Planet, involving more than 50,000 viewers from 73 countries, the tiger was voted the world's favourite animal with 21% of the vote, narrowly beating the dog.
Tiger|tiger|In Chinese myth and culture, the tiger is one of the 12 animals of the Chinese zodiac
Tiger|tiger|In Chinese art, the tiger is depicted as an earth symbol and equal rival of the Chinese dragon – the two representing matter and spirit respectively
Tiger|tiger|The Southern Chinese martial art Hung Ga is based on the movements of the tiger and the crane
Tiger|tiger|In Imperial China, a tiger was the personification of war and often represented the highest army general (or present day defense secretary), while the emperor and empress were represented by a dragon and phoenix, respectively
Tiger|tiger|The White Tiger (Chinese
Tiger|tiger|白虎; pinyin
Tiger|tiger|Bái Hǔ) is one of the Four Symbols of the Chinese constellations
Tiger|tiger|It is sometimes called the White Tiger of the West (Chinese
Tiger|tiger|西方白虎), and it represents the west and the autumn season.The tiger's tail appears in stories from countries including China and Korea, it being generally inadvisable to grasp a tiger by the tail
Tiger|tiger|In Korean myth and culture, the tiger is regarded as a guardian that drives away evil spirits and a sacred creature that brings good luck – the symbol of courage and absolute power
Tiger|tiger|For the people who live in and around the forests of Korea, the tiger considered the symbol of the Mountain Spirit or King of mountain animals
Tiger|tiger|"So, Koreans also called the tigers ""San Gun"" (산군) means Mountain Lord.In Buddhism, the tiger is one of the Three Senseless Creatures, symbolising anger, with the monkey representing greed and the deer lovesickness"
Tiger|tiger|"The Tungusic peoples considered the Siberian tiger a near-deity and often referred to it as ""Grandfather"" or ""Old man"""
Tiger|tiger|"The Udege and Nanai called it ""Amba"""
Tiger|tiger|"The Manchu considered the Siberian tiger as ""Hu Lin,"" the king"
Tiger|tiger|In Hinduism, the god Shiva wears and sits on tiger skin
Tiger|tiger|The ten-armed warrior goddess Durga rides the tigress (or lioness) Damon into battle
Tiger|tiger|In southern India the god Ayyappan was associated with a tiger
Tiger|tiger|The weretiger replaces the werewolf in shapeshifting folklore in Asia; in India they were evil sorcerers, while in Indonesia and Malaysia they were somewhat more benign
Tiger|tiger|In Greco-Roman tradition, the tiger was depicted being ridden by the god Dionysus.
Tiger|tiger|In the Hindu epic Mahabharata, the tiger is fiercer and more ruthless than the lion
Tiger|tiger|"In William Blake's poem in his Songs of Experience (1794), titled ""The Tyger"", the tiger is a menacing and fearful animal"
Tiger|tiger|In Yann Martel's 2001 Man Booker Prize winning novel Life of Pi, the protagonist, surviving shipwreck for months in a small boat, somehow avoids being eaten by the other survivor, a large Bengal tiger
Tiger|tiger|The story was adapted in Ang Lee's 2012 feature film of the same name
Tiger|tiger|Jim Corbett's 1944 Man-Eaters of Kumaon tells ten true stories of his tiger-hunting exploits in what is now the northern Uttarakhand region of India
Tiger|tiger|The book has sold over four million copies, and has been the basis of both fictional and documentary films
Tiger|tiger|In Rudyard Kipling's 1894 The Jungle Book, the tiger, Shere Khan, is the mortal enemy of the human protagonist, Mowgli
Tiger|tiger|More benign tiger characters include Tigger in A
Tiger|tiger|A
Tiger|tiger|Milne's Winnie-the-Pooh and Hobbes of the comic strip Calvin and Hobbes, both of whom are represented as simply stuffed animals come to life.Tigers are also mascots for various sports teams around the world
Tiger|tiger|"Tony the Tiger is a famous mascot for Kellogg's breakfast cereal Frosted Flakes, known for its catchphrase ""They're Gr-r-reat!"""
Tiger|tiger|The Esso (Exxon) brand of petrol was advertised from 1959 onwards with the slogan 'put a tiger in your tank', and a tiger mascot; more than 2.5 million synthetic tiger tails were sold to motorists, who tied them to their petrol tank caps.
Tiger|tiger|The tiger is one of the animals displayed on the Pashupati seal of the Indus Valley Civilisation
Tiger|tiger|The tiger was the emblem of the Chola Dynasty and was depicted on coins, seals and banners
Tiger|tiger|The seals of several Chola copper coins show the tiger, the Pandyan emblem fish and the Chera emblem bow, indicating that the Cholas had achieved political supremacy over the latter two dynasties
Tiger|tiger|Gold coins found in Kavilayadavalli in the Nellore district of Andhra Pradesh have motifs of the tiger, bow and some indistinct marks
Tiger|tiger|The tiger symbol of Chola Empire was later adopted by the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam and the tiger became a symbol of the unrecognised state of Tamil Eelam and Tamil independence movement
Tiger|tiger|The Bengal tiger is the national animal of India and Bangladesh
Tiger|tiger|The Malaysian tiger is the national animal of Malaysia
Tiger|tiger|The Siberian tiger is the national animal of South Korea.
Tiger|tiger|The tyger, a depiction of tigers as they were understood by European artists, is among the creatures used in charges and supporters in European heraldry
Tiger|tiger|This creature has several notable differences from real tigers, including absent stripes, a leonine tufted tail, and a head terminating in large, pointed jaws
Tiger|tiger|A more realistic version of the tiger entered the heraldic armory through the British Empire's expansion into Asia, and is referred to as the Bengal tiger to distinguish it from its older counterpart
Tiger|tiger|The Bengal tiger is not a very common creature in heraldry, but is present as a supporter in the arms of Bombay and emblazoned on the shield of the University of Madras.

21st Century Tiger|tiger|21st Century Tiger raises funds for wild tiger conservation projects
21st Century Tiger|tiger|It was formed in 1997 as a partnership between the Zoological Society of London (ZSL), Global Tiger Patrol (GTP) and Tusk Force (both now defunct) so that the three groups could collaborate, rather than compete, in raising money for tigers in the UK
21st Century Tiger|tiger|The two current members of the coalition are Zoological Society of London (ZSL) and Dreamworld Wildlife Foundation (DWF)
21st Century Tiger|tiger|Based in offices provided by ZSL and with administration funded by a sponsor, it is able to spend 100% of funds raised on tiger projects
21st Century Tiger|tiger|21st Century Tiger is one of the top seven contributors to tiger conservation worldwide (IUCN Cat Projects Database, unpubl.) and since its inception it has provided over £2 million to over 70 tiger projects in seven countries.
21st Century Tiger|tiger|21st Century Tiger was established in 1997 and formally launched at the Tigers 2000 meeting at ZSL in 1997 by John Gummer, the then UK Minister for the Environment
21st Century Tiger|tiger|It assisted the UK's Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (DEFRA) in channeling funds for tiger conservation to effective projects in tiger range
21st Century Tiger|tiger|Current support has come from members of the public, businesses, and notably from zoos, particularly in Europe and Australasia.
21st Century Tiger|tiger|Realising the potential fundraising abilities of the European Zoo community, between 2002 and 2004 the European Association of Zoos and Aquaria (EAZA) Tiger Campaign in European zoos raised over three-quarters of a million euros which was channelled through 21st Century Tiger
21st Century Tiger|tiger|Over 130 zoos in 24 countries took part in the campaign, from Finland to France and from Ireland to Russia.
21st Century Tiger|tiger|Zoo and Aquarium Association (Australasia) formerly known as ARAZPA, launched a parallel tiger campaign during 2003, also using 21st Century Tiger to channel the funds and raised more than A$100,000
21st Century Tiger|tiger|ZAAA zoos hold only the Sumatran tiger, unlike European zoos which have both Amur and Sumatran, and their efforts continue to be focused on projects in Sumatra.
21st Century Tiger|tiger|Since its inception, 21st Century Tiger has funded over 70 projects, distributing over £2 million and supported projects in seven countries - India, Indonesia, China, Malaysia, Cambodia, Thailand and Russia
21st Century Tiger|tiger|The projects cover a wide spectrum of requirements for tiger conservation, including training for wildlife rangers in the application of wildlife law, jungle survival and identification of endangered species, support for anti-poaching units which deal directly with poachers, uncover networks of illegal trading, and even advise in cases of human-tiger conflict
21st Century Tiger|tiger|In Russia and Indonesia scientific research is also funded, including studies of tiger home ranges and tiger prey densities, and of methods for limiting the habitat damage caused by economic development
21st Century Tiger|tiger|Comprehensive and thorough research provides a sound scientific basis for conservation planning and is an essential part of any conservation programme
21st Century Tiger|tiger|21st Century Tiger also funds education and awareness raising programmes within tiger range countries; vital for ensuring sustainable local support for wildlife conservation.
21st Century Tiger|tiger|21st Century Tiger works with a range of organisations from the internationally known Wildlife Conservation Society (WCS) and International Fund for Animal Welfare (IFAW) to small, focused local groups such as  Phoenix Fund in Russia
21st Century Tiger|tiger|All projects submitted for funding are rigorously examined by a panel of international experts
21st Century Tiger|tiger|The projects must have sound practical scientific and conservation value and use local staff wherever possible.
21st Century Tiger|tiger|"The international conservation community who met at the Kathmandu Tiger Workshop in late 2009, announced in their official recommendations that we should ""celebrate 2010, Year of the Tiger, throughout the world, to create global awareness of the critical plight of the wild tiger and enlist broad and deep support for their conservation"""
21st Century Tiger|tiger|21st Century Tiger did just that and worked with other NGOs, businesses, the zoo community and members of the public and raised over £144,000 for tigers

Siegfried & Roy|tiger|Siegfried & Roy were a duo of German-American magicians and entertainers, best known for their appearances with white lions and white tigers
Siegfried & Roy|tiger|It was composed of Siegfried Fischbacher (June 13, 1939 – January 13, 2021) and Roy Horn (born Uwe Ludwig Horn; October 3, 1944 – May 8, 2020).
Siegfried & Roy|tiger|From February 1, 1990, until Horn's career-ending injury on his birthday on October 3, 2003, the duo formed Siegfried & Roy at the Mirage Resort and Casino, which was regarded as the most-visited show in Las Vegas, Nevada
Siegfried & Roy|tiger|From August 2004 to May 2005, Fischbacher and Horn were executive producers of the animated sitcom Father of the Pride.
Siegfried & Roy|tiger|Fischbacher and Horn were born and raised in Germany
Siegfried & Roy|tiger|They moved to the United States and became naturalized citizens in 1988.
Siegfried & Roy|tiger|Siegfried Fischbacher was born in Rosenheim, Bavaria, Germany, on June 13, 1939, to Martin and Maria Fischbacher
Siegfried & Roy|tiger|His mother was a housewife, and his father a professional painter who during World War II ended up as a prisoner of war in the Soviet Union
Siegfried & Roy|tiger|Fischbacher purchased a book about magic tricks as a child and began to practice illusions
Siegfried & Roy|tiger|He moved to Italy in 1956 and started work at a hotel.Eventually, Fischbacher found work performing magic on the ship TS Bremen under the stage name Delmare
Siegfried & Roy|tiger|While performing aboard the ship, he met Horn and asked him to assist him during a show.
Siegfried & Roy|tiger|33  Fischbacher and Horn were fired from the TS Bremen for bringing a live cheetah onto the ship, but were scouted by a cruise line based in New York and began performing together as a duo.
Siegfried & Roy|tiger|Roy was born Uwe Ludwig Horn on October 3, 1944, in Nordenham, Oldenburg, Germany, in the midst of bomb attacks, to Johanna Horn
Siegfried & Roy|tiger|His father died in World War II, and his mother married a construction worker after the war ended
Siegfried & Roy|tiger|She later began work in a factory
Siegfried & Roy|tiger|Horn had three brothers
Siegfried & Roy|tiger|Manfred, Alfred, and Werner
Siegfried & Roy|tiger|Horn became interested in animals at a very young age and cared for his childhood dog named Hexe (witch)
Siegfried & Roy|tiger|Horn's mother's friend's husband Emil was the founder of Bremen Zoo, which gave Horn access to exotic animals from the age of 10.
Siegfried & Roy|tiger|25–31  Horn left school at age 13
Siegfried & Roy|tiger|He worked as a waiter on the cruise ship Bremen, where he met Fischbacher and launched his performance career.
Siegfried & Roy|tiger|The owner of the Astoria Theatre in Bremen saw Fischbacher and Horn's act aboard a Caribbean cruise ship and recruited the duo to perform at her nightclub
Siegfried & Roy|tiger|This launched a career for the pair on the European nightclub circuit, and they began to perform with tigers
Siegfried & Roy|tiger|They were discovered performing in Paris by Tony Azzie, who asked them to come to Las Vegas in 1967
Siegfried & Roy|tiger|They spent some time in Puerto Rico and may have purchased property there.
Siegfried & Roy|tiger|51 In 1981, Ken Feld of Irvin & Kenneth Feld Productions started the Beyond Belief show with them at the New Frontier Hotel and Casino
Siegfried & Roy|tiger|A revamped version of the show was taken on a world tour in the third quarter of 1988.In October 1988, Fischbacher and Horn became naturalized US citizens.During a period of their careers, Fischbacher and Horn were romantically involved, though they avoided discussion of their private lives.
Siegfried & Roy|tiger|During a show at the Mirage on Horn's birthday on October 3, 2003, a seven-year-old white tiger named Montecore attacked Horn
Siegfried & Roy|tiger|"As part of the act, but veering off script, Horn held his microphone to Montecore's mouth and told him to say ""hello"" to the audience"
Siegfried & Roy|tiger|Montecore responded by biting Horn's sleeve
Siegfried & Roy|tiger|"Horn swatted the tiger and barked ""release!"", while standby trainers unsuccessfully attempted to distract the cat with cubes of meat"
Siegfried & Roy|tiger|Possibly incited by Horn's retreat, the tiger leapt at Horn, swinging at his legs and knocking him off his feet.As trainers rushed in from offstage to assist, Montecore bit into Horn's neck and dragged him offstage
Siegfried & Roy|tiger|Trainers got the tiger to release Horn by spraying him with CO2 fire extinguisher canisters, the last resort available.The attack severed Horn's spine, resulted in massive blood loss, and severely injured other parts of his body, permanently impairing his motor and verbal abilities
Siegfried & Roy|tiger|"He also had a stroke either before or after Montecore dragged him offstage.While being taken to the hospital, Horn stated, ""Montecore is a great cat"
Siegfried & Roy|tiger|"Make sure no harm comes to Montecore."" He told People in September 2004 that Montecore saved his life by trying to drag him to safety after he had a stroke"
Siegfried & Roy|tiger|The incident prompted the Mirage to close the show, which had 267 cast and crew members.Trainer Chris Lawrence later contradicted Fischbacher and Horn's explanations for why the tiger attacked Horn, alleging it was due to Horn's mishandling of Montecore
Siegfried & Roy|tiger|"The duo dismissed Lawrence's claims, stating he ""had problems with his life anyway."" Lawrence later said he believed that the duo and the Mirage covered up the real reason for the attack in order to protect their image."
Siegfried & Roy|tiger|In August 2004, their act became the basis for Father of the Pride
Siegfried & Roy|tiger|Right before its release, the series was almost cancelled until Fischbacher and Horn urged NBC to continue production after Horn's condition improved following the attack by Montecore in October 2003
Siegfried & Roy|tiger|By March 2006, Horn was talking and walking, with assistance from Fischbacher, and appeared on Pat O'Brien's television news program The Insider to discuss his daily rehabilitation.In February 2009, the duo staged a final appearance with Montecore as a benefit for the Lou Ruvo Brain Institute (though Chris Lawrence had stated this performance involved a different tiger)
Siegfried & Roy|tiger|Their performance was recorded for broadcast on ABC television's 20/20 program.On April 23, 2010, Fischbacher and Horn retired from show business
Siegfried & Roy|tiger|"""The last time we closed, we didn't have a lot of warning"", said longtime manager Bernie Yuman"
Siegfried & Roy|tiger|"""This is farewell"
Siegfried & Roy|tiger|"This is the dot at the end of the sentence.""On March 19, 2014, Montecore died after a brief illness"
Siegfried & Roy|tiger|He was 17 years old.In June 2016, director Philipp Stölzl announced that Fischbacher and Horn would produce a biopic film documenting their lives.
Siegfried & Roy|tiger|"On April 28, 2020, Horn's publicist stated that he ""tested positive for the virus that causes COVID-19 and is currently responding well to treatment"""
Siegfried & Roy|tiger|However, his condition deteriorated, and he died at the age of 75 on May 8, 2020, at Mountain View Hospital in Las Vegas during the COVID-19 pandemic in Nevada
Siegfried & Roy|tiger|The duo's spokesman, Dave Kirvin, announced Horn's death and said it was due to complications from the disease
Siegfried & Roy|tiger|"Fischbacher stated that ""the world has lost one of the greats of magic, but I have lost my best friend""."
Siegfried & Roy|tiger|On January 11, 2021, Fischbacher announced he had terminal pancreatic cancer
Siegfried & Roy|tiger|He died in Las Vegas two days later, on January 13, 2021, at the age of 81.

Tiger King|tiger|Murder, Mayhem, and Madness (titled onscreen as simply Tiger King) is an American true crime documentary streaming television series about the life of former zookeeper and convicted felon Joe Exotic
Tiger King|tiger|The first season was released on Netflix on March 20, 2020
Tiger King|tiger|A second season, titled Tiger King 2, was announced in September 2021 and was released on November 17, 2021
Tiger King|tiger|The series focuses on the small but deeply interconnected society of big cat conservationists such as Carole Baskin, owner of Big Cat Rescue, and collectors such as Exotic, whom Baskin accuses of abusing and exploiting wild animals.
Tiger King|tiger|Season 1 received positive reviews from critics, and according to Nielsen ratings, was watched by 34.3 million people over its first ten days of release, ranking as one of Netflix's most successful releases to date, partly due to its release amid the early months of the COVID-19 pandemic, and also inspired several memes online
Tiger King|tiger|Despite its success and popularity, the season received criticism from conservation and animal rights groups for its framing and inaccuracies related to private breeding and wildlife conservation issues
Tiger King|tiger|A special aftershow hosted by Joel McHale was released on April 12, 2020, with McHale interviewing several of its subjects about Exotic and the series itself
Tiger King|tiger|Season 2 in contrast received mostly negative reviews from fans and critics, and was subject of a lawsuit by Carole and Howard Baskin over footage used in the series.

Tiger King|tiger|Animal welfare groups, conservation organizations and wildlife biologists have criticized the series and its filmmakers.Several conservation and animal rights groups criticized the filmmakers for framing private big cat breeding as a legitimate form of conservation
Tiger King|tiger|Representatives from Wildlife Conservation Society, World Wide Fund for Nature, Panthera Corporation and National Geographic criticized the show for its equivocation of the unregulated private breeding with captive breeding for species reintroduction, highlighting that the latter is strictly controlled by the Species Survival Plan and only takes place in zoos accredited by the Association of Zoos and Aquariums
Tiger King|tiger|Privately bred cats cannot be reintroduced to the wild as several of the private breeders interviewed suggested, as they would be unlikely to survive in the wild, and are likely hybrids which could cause genetic pollution.The filmmakers were also criticized for implying that roadside zoo operations are as legitimate as accredited zoos, and Big Cat Rescue specifically
Tiger King|tiger|The first season and director have suggested Big Cat Rescue's enclosures are small or do not meet ethical standards, but their facilities meet humane standards set out by Global Federation of Animal Sanctuaries
Tiger King|tiger|Elle noted that Baskin was portrayed as hypocritical for keeping the tigers in captivity instead of releasing them, without explaining that doing so was not an option—being captive-bred from mixed stock, as well as in-effect domesticated, meant they were unsuited to either survive in the wild or rebuild regional populations
Tiger King|tiger|Michael Webber, director of The Elephant in the Living Room, also criticized the parallels drawn between the private zoos and Big Cat Rescue
Tiger King|tiger|"The first season was also accused of minimizing Baskin's efforts to lobby Congress for stricter legislation on animal trafficking.""Goode brings to Tiger King the intellectual rigor and social responsibility of .."
Tiger King|tiger|"a nightclub and hotel developer"", Peter Frick-Wright, who had produced Cat People, a podcast series covering the American big-cat industry, wrote in Outside"
Tiger King|tiger|He found the first season particularly unfair to Baskin, pointing out that in focusing on her husband's disappearance so much it failed to distinguish her from Exotic and Antle, barely mentioning that Big Cat Rescue only accepts tigers confiscated by law enforcement or from owners who could no longer handle them—owners who had to sign a contract with heavy financial penalties if they owned another big cat or were even photographed with one, a provision not mentioned in the first season
Tiger King|tiger|Baskin also forbids volunteers or staff from touching the animals; they are fired for doing so, Frick-Wright wrote.Others criticized the sympathetic portrayal of Joe Exotic
Tiger King|tiger|"The director of Animals Asia Foundation expressed disappointment that the Netflix series ""does not fully condemn many of the activities that [Exotic] was involved with"" and criticized the filmmakers for downplaying the animal cruelty and commercial purposes of Exotic's zoo"
Tiger King|tiger|Conversely, Baskin is the only source in the first season from the conservation sector, and the only source explaining why keeping the wild animals was abusive, but is depicted in an unsympathetic light.Some criticism noted the lack of clear environmental or conservation message
Tiger King|tiger|An article in The New York Times drew parallels with other recent wildlife films like Blackfish, which had a major impact on their subject matter
Tiger King|tiger|Blackfish led to a severe drop in ticket sales at SeaWorld and reduced support for cetaceans in captivity, eventually leading to changes in legislation and practices
Tiger King|tiger|"The producer of Blackfish criticized Tiger King, saying that issues surrounding big cats were ""lost in the show's 'soap opera-esque drama'"""
Tiger King|tiger|"Karl Ammann, a photographer and documentarian specializing in the illegal wildlife trade who was approached to be interviewed by the filmmakers of Tiger King, similarly expressed disappointment at the lack of conservation message in the first season, saying ""to totally ignore such key aspects was a real missed opportunity"".PETA and the Humane Society of the United States, both of which had previously investigated and campaigned against the animal abuse of Exotic and other private breeders featured in the show, responded more positively to Tiger King for raising the profile of the issue of big cats in captivity"
Tiger King|tiger|"However, PETA noted the first season ""largely skips over serious issues of animal welfare, including the horrors of cub trafficking and the problems with commercial cub-petting attractions""."
Tiger King|tiger|Joe Exotic is the main focus of the series, with the documentary causing him to receive significant amounts of attention on social media
Tiger King|tiger|Ironically, despite the first season being responsible for his worldwide fame and fanbase, he has not watched the series himself, due to being arrested prior to its release
Tiger King|tiger|Nevertheless, Netflix interviewed Exotic in jail, asking what he thinks of both the first season and his newfound fame
Tiger King|tiger|Exotic stated that he loved the fame, but wished he could experience it firsthand
Tiger King|tiger|He also expressed remorse for his actions after being in jail, stating to his fans;
Tiger King|tiger|Go sit in a cage with your animals for a week
Tiger King|tiger|I mean, when I left the zoo and I sent my chimpanzees to the sanctuary in Florida and imagined what my chimpanzees went through for 18 years, I'm ashamed of myself.
Tiger King|tiger|"Exotic added that he's ""done with the Carole Baskin saga."" In 2021, he began criticising some of the other people featured in the documentary, stating that ""not one person came forward until the Netflix series came out and they could profit from it.""  Joe claims to not have profited at all from the series"
Tiger King|tiger|In the show's final arc, Joe is out of work and destitute, and law enforcement’s noose finally closes in on him
Tiger King|tiger|"Carole Baskin and her husband Howard felt betrayed by filmmakers, stating she was told the discussion of Joe Exotic and Baskin's missing husband were just for context.In a post on the Big Cat Rescue website, Baskin said that the show ""has a segment [in the third episode] devoted to suggesting, with lies and innuendos from people who are not credible, that I had a role in the disappearance of my husband Don 21 years ago"" and that the first season ""presents this without any regard for the truth"""
Tiger King|tiger|Baskin has never been charged with anything related to Don's disappearance and has always denied having anything to do with it
Tiger King|tiger|"In partial response to Baskin, director Goode stated while he felt Baskin had the right intention, he questioned if ""it was fair to keep these tigers in cages"", adding that the tigers ""pace neurotically"" and that ""Sometimes you wonder whether or not one should humanely euthanize these cats instead of [letting them] suffer in cages"""
Tiger King|tiger|"Baskin preemptively answered that "".."
Tiger King|tiger|our goal is to end having them in cages and have no need for a sanctuary like ours
Tiger King|tiger|"Our federal bill, the Big Cat Public Safety Act, would stop the cub petting that drives the breeding and end ownership as pets in back yards."" In addition, Goode and Chaiklin insisted that Baskin ""wasn't coerced"" into answering questions about her former husband.In February 2021, Baskin revealed that she had been asked to feature in a planned second season of the show, but she refused and told the producers to ""lose her number"".On November 1, 2021, Carole Baskin and her husband Howard Baskin filed a lawsuit against Netflix and Royal Goode Productions over an alleged breach of contract"
Tiger King|tiger|They claim that their initial release did not grant the producers liberty to produce derivative works or sequels using the original footage shot of Carol and Howard
Tiger King|tiger|The lawsuit requested an injunction to stop the release of the film on November 17
Tiger King|tiger|On November 5, a federal judge denied Baskin's motion for a temporary restraining order that would block Netflix and Royal Goode Productions from featuring footage of her, her husband Howard Baskin and their Big Cat Rescue sanctuary in Season 2 of Tiger King
Tiger King|tiger|"The judge ruled that the Baskins ""are not entitled to the extraordinary remedy of a temporary restraining order, which would be entered before Defendants have had an adequate opportunity to respond."" The judge further added that the case would not necessarily entitle the Baskins to financial compensation"
Tiger King|tiger|"The Federal Court in Tampa Bay also denied a preliminary injunction on November 15, 2021 just two days before the shows' premiere, after defense attorneys for Netflix said a delay would ""hurt marketing momentum"" and violate the first amendment, which in this case would be classified ""Freedom of the press.”"
Tiger King|tiger|This is not a documentary
Tiger King|tiger|This is a salacious, outrageous ride through a television show produced to create drama, to just tie you in to some crazy train wreck of a story between the feud of Carole Baskin and Joe Exotic
Tiger King|tiger|Questions about Carole and Joe were a dozen or so thrown into hundreds of others

Tiger King|tiger|The Doc Antle Story
Tiger King|tiger|It is set to release on December 10, 2021.
Tiger versus lion|tiger|Historically, a comparison of the tiger (Panthera tigris) versus the lion (Panthera leo) has been a popular topic of discussion by hunters, naturalists, artists and poets
Tiger versus lion|tiger|It has historically inspired the popular imagination
Tiger versus lion|tiger|In the past, lions and tigers reportedly competed in the wilderness, where their ranges overlapped in Eurasia
Tiger versus lion|tiger|The most common reported circumstance of their meeting is in captivity, either deliberately or accidentally.
Tiger versus lion|tiger|In general, the lion is a social animal, while the tiger is solitary, though at times, male lions (especially in India) are separate from the females, and tigers socialise, usually for mating, and rarely for hunts
Tiger versus lion|tiger|There are differing scenarios regarding whether tigers would beat lions in fights, or vice-versa:
Tiger versus lion|tiger|Craig Saffoe, a biologist and the curator of great cats at the National Zoological Park in Washington, D.C., said that the outcome of a given fight totally depended on the individuals, with their fighting style, physiology and history, but that he would bet on the tiger winning
Tiger versus lion|tiger|He also reckoned that the big cats ranked, from higher to lower, with tigers, jaguars and lions on top, and then cougars, snow leopards, leopards, and cheetahs
Tiger versus lion|tiger|"At the same time, he said that the most interesting ""match-up would be a good size Bengal tiger and a good-size male jaguar,"" because they had roughly the same speed, temperament, size and strength, in his opinion."
Tiger versus lion|tiger|Dave Hoover, the animal trainer for Clyde Beatty-Cole Brothers Circus, mentions that he lost many tigers to male lions
Tiger versus lion|tiger|"""I have to keep the male lions from killing each other"
Tiger versus lion|tiger|I have to keep them from killing the tigers [...]
Tiger versus lion|tiger|"I have lost tigers."" Although Hoover had his lions gang up on his tigers, ""Two lions killed one of his tigers during training in Ojus, Fla., in 1966"", in another newspaper he states he has trouble ""keeping the lion from attacking the lone tiger""."
Tiger versus lion|tiger|Renowned Indian naturalist and conservationist Kailash Sankhala wrote in his 1978 book Tiger
Tiger versus lion|tiger|The Story of the Indian Tiger that the tiger would be unable to get close to the lion's vital joints because of his thick mane, and that the tiger would be vulnerable to the lion
Tiger versus lion|tiger|"He mentioned that once an Indian prince organized a fight in which the lion killed the tiger, and opined that ""a tiger is no match for even a single lion of equal strength""."
Tiger versus lion|tiger|As of 2021, India is the only country to have both wild lions and tigers, specifically Asiatic lions and Bengal tigers
Tiger versus lion|tiger|Though they do not share the same territory, they did in the past, and there is a project mentioned below that could lead to their meeting in the wild.Before the end of the 20th century, Asiatic lions and Caspian tigers had occurred in other Asian or Eurasian nations, including Iran
Tiger versus lion|tiger|As such, there is a word for 'Lion', which can also mean 'Tiger', and is used in Iran, South Asia and other areas, that is 'Sher' or 'Shir' (Persian
Tiger versus lion|tiger|شیر‎), and its significance is discussed below
Tiger versus lion|tiger|Not only did Heptner and Sludskiy had talk about the lion and tiger both occurring in places like Iran, Anatolia and Transcaucasia, they also mentioned that the ranges of the lion and tiger often overlapped.According to Colin Tudge (2011), given that both cats hunt large herbivores, it is likely that they had been in competition in Asia
Tiger versus lion|tiger|Despite their social nature, lions might have competed with tigers one-against-one, as they would with each other
Tiger versus lion|tiger|Apart from the possibility of competition, there are legends of Asiatic lions and tigers breeding to produce hybrid offspring, which would be ligers or tigons
Tiger versus lion|tiger|From the fossil record, besides genetics, it would appear that the modern lion and tiger were present in Eurasia since the Pleistocene, when now-extinct relatives also existed there
Tiger versus lion|tiger|Additionally, in the days before Indian Independence, the Maharaja of Gwalior introduced African lions into his area, which is a habitat for Bengal tigers.
Tiger versus lion|tiger|The possibility of conflict between lions and tigers had been raised in relation to India's Asiatic Lion Reintroduction Project, which was meant to introduce the Gir Forest's lions to another reserve which is considered to be within the former range of the lion, that is Kuno Wildlife Sanctuary in Madhya Pradesh, before December 2017
Tiger versus lion|tiger|Kuno was reported to contain some tigers that came from Ranthambore Park, including one called 'T-38'
Tiger versus lion|tiger|"Concerns were raised that the co-presence of lions and tigers would ""trigger frequent clashes"""
Tiger versus lion|tiger|At the same, the American biologist Craig Packer and his students at the University of Minnesota considered that a group of lions (two to three males) would have a clear advantage over a tiger and a pack of lionesses (two to four females) would have a similar advantage over a tigress, despite the general advantage of the latter in weight or height
Tiger versus lion|tiger|Coalitions of male lions usually fight as a group against territorial rivals, so he mentions that a tiger may have an advantage in a one-on-one encounter, but they also considered that the additional fighting experience and mane perhaps confer an advantage to a lone male lion since the tiger's fighting style evolved in the absence of a mane
Tiger versus lion|tiger|Despite all of this, Craig Packer is of the opinion that for Asiatic lions to survive in an area with Bengal tigers, the lions would have to be moved there as intact groups rather than as individuals
Tiger versus lion|tiger|Although the habitats of Indian lions and tigers are similar means that they both live in conditions that favour solitary hunters of prey, these lions are social like their African relatives, and may form fighting groups, whereas tigers are usually solitary.Reginald Innes Pocock (1939) mentioned that some people had the opinion that the tiger played a role in the near-extinction of the Indian lion, but he dismissed this view as 'fanciful'
Tiger versus lion|tiger|According to him, there was evidence that tigers inhabited the Indian Subcontinent before lions
Tiger versus lion|tiger|The tigers likely entered Northern India from the eastern end of the Himalayas, through Burma, and started spreading throughout the area, before the lions likely entered Northern India from Balochistan or Persia, and spread to places like the Bengal and the Nerbudda River
Tiger versus lion|tiger|Because of that, before the presence of man could limit the spread of lions, tigers reached parts of India that lions did not reach
Tiger versus lion|tiger|However, the presence of tigers throughout India did not stop the spread of lions there, in the first place, so Pocock said that it is unlikely that Bengal tigers played a role, significant or subordinate, in the near-extinction of the Indian lion, rather, that man was responsible for it, as was the case with the decline in tigers' numbers
Tiger versus lion|tiger|As such, Pocock thought that it was unlikely that serious competition between them regularly occurred, and that even if Indian lions and tigers met, the chance that they would fight for survival was as good as the chance that they would choose to avoid each other, and that their chances of success, if they were to clash, were as good as each other's.
Tiger versus lion|tiger|In the circuses of Ancient Rome, exotic beasts were commonly pitted against each other, including Barbary lions and tigers
Tiger versus lion|tiger|A mosaic in the House of the Faun in Pompeii shows a fight between a lion and a tiger
Tiger versus lion|tiger|There are different accounts of which of these animals gained the victory
Tiger versus lion|tiger|Although lions and tigers can be kept together in harmony in captivity, fatal conflicts have also been recorded.In addition to historical recordings, clashes between lions and tigers were reported or even caught on camera in the 19th and 20th centuries
Tiger versus lion|tiger|It was not always clear which species regularly beat the other, according to Doctor Packer (2015).
Tiger versus lion|tiger|In 1830, a tiger attacked a lion at a menagerie in Turin, Rome

Tiger versus lion|tiger|"A 1857 London newspaper referring to the same incident reported the lion was a ""very fine lion, six or seven years old"""
Tiger versus lion|tiger|One source stated the lion was in confinement (captivity) for three years, implying the lion would be three years old at a minimum
Tiger versus lion|tiger|While the tiger was of 18 months of age, but of large size
Tiger versus lion|tiger|"A newspaper refers to the tiger 'Gunga', whose name was also ""Nina Shahib"" and who, before the fight took place with the lion in London, had attacked its keeper"
Tiger versus lion|tiger|The two animals were found fighting each other, in which the keepers made fruitless efforts to part the two animals
Tiger versus lion|tiger|Towards the end of the fight, the lion gained a brief advantage, were its mane deflected the tigers attack at which point the tiger, while on his back, with swift strikes and using his back legs, tore open the lion's stomach
Tiger versus lion|tiger|The lion died after that
Tiger versus lion|tiger|"The tiger ""Nina Shahib"" was thought to have been mortally injured"

Tiger versus lion|tiger|According to the Gettysburg Compiler and The Baltimore Sun (1899), towards the end of the 19th century in India, the Gaekwad of Baroda, that is Sayajirao III, arranged a fight in an amphitheater, between a magnificent prime wild Barbary lion called 'Atlas', from the Atlas Mountains between Algeria and Morocco, and a man-eating Bengal tiger from the Indian region of Shimla, both large and hungry (with their diets reduced before the fight), before an audience of thousands, instead of between an Indian lion and the tiger, as Indian lions were believed to be no match for Bengal tigers
Tiger versus lion|tiger|The tiger was more than 10 feet (3.0 metres) long, over 4 feet (120 centimetres) feet at the shoulder, had strong shoulders and long teeth and claws, and was agile
Tiger versus lion|tiger|The lion looked taller at the head than the tiger, and had a large mane, legs and paws
Tiger versus lion|tiger|"The tiger was seen as ""the personification of graceful strength and supple energy,"" whereas the lion was seen as the ""embodiment of massive power and adamantine muscle"""
Tiger versus lion|tiger|In the fight, both cats sustained injuries, and although the tiger sometimes retreated from Atlas, it would come back to fight it, and in the end, managed to scratch Atlas to death, though Atlas pushed it off in one final move before dying
Tiger versus lion|tiger|"The Gaekwad agreed to pay 37,000 rupees, accepted that the tiger was the ""King of the Cat Family,"" decreed that Atlas' body be given a Royal burial, and that the tiger should have a ""cage of honour"" in the menagerie of Baroda, and decided to prepare the tiger for a battle with a Sierran grizzly bear weighing more than 1,500 lb (680 kilograms)"

Tiger versus lion|tiger|The party not only managed to see the lion and tiger rolling about in their battle, after going through bushes, but also the man who fell victim to the tiger
Tiger versus lion|tiger|"The author termed both the lion and tiger as ""tyrants of the forest,"" given that they would attack weaker creatures"
Tiger versus lion|tiger|The tiger was about the same size as the lion, but more agile
Tiger versus lion|tiger|As for the lion, it used greater strength, and its mane, which was somewhat deeper than those of its bigger African cousins, could protect its head from the tiger's claws, though not other parts of its body, such as the back
Tiger versus lion|tiger|They were as determined and brave as each other, but the lion endured
Tiger versus lion|tiger|It caught the tiger's throat, turned it on its back, and killed it by clawing its abdomen open
Tiger versus lion|tiger|"The lion was thus hailed as the ""King of Beasts"""
Tiger versus lion|tiger|Otherwise, the fight had been harsh for both beasts, to the extent that the author felt that it would avenge their victims.
Tiger versus lion|tiger|The Sun (New York) reported that in a depopulated Indian village at the bank of a creek connected to the Cauvery River, about 30 mi (48 km) north-west of Bangalore, a hunter injured by a venomous creature saw a tiger on his left-hand side, and a lion on his right-hand side
Tiger versus lion|tiger|"The tiger was a ""rousing big fellow, who had seen 15 years of his life,"" and had muscular limbs"
Tiger versus lion|tiger|"The male lion was ""medium-sized"""
Tiger versus lion|tiger|Both of them stalked him, but they did not notice each other at first, as they were separated by a wall that was about 4 ft (120 cm) tall, and their focus was on the witness
Tiger versus lion|tiger|When they got closer to him, the tiger scented the lion, and behaved like an angry cat, which included making a noise that startled the latter
Tiger versus lion|tiger|The lion showed its teeth in response, and after reaching the end of the wall, roared at its foe
Tiger versus lion|tiger|After the lion's head showed around the wall, the crouching tiger pounced on it, and rolled over with it
Tiger versus lion|tiger|Tigers often kill victims by biting their throats, and keeping their hold on them for as long as necessary, but that was not the case with this struggle
Tiger versus lion|tiger|Despite different descriptions of their sizes by the narrator, and that the tiger was more agile than the lion, the tiger's neck was vulnerable to a bite by the lion, and for reasons like these, it was difficult for either cat to defeat the other, overall
Tiger versus lion|tiger|After they temporarily retreated from each other, the hunter could see that they were both injured
Tiger versus lion|tiger|Still, they were determined to destroy each other
Tiger versus lion|tiger|The lion and tiger respectively roared and snarled
Tiger versus lion|tiger|The narrator suspected that their hatred for each other may have been because both had been hunting him at the same time, therefore, their respective presences interfered with each other's hunt for him
Tiger versus lion|tiger|The tiger pounced on the lion's back, rolling over or falling with it again
Tiger versus lion|tiger|The lion seemed helpless as the tiger held onto its fore shoulder, before making a move in which it managed to catch the tiger's neck
Tiger versus lion|tiger|Now the tiger seemed helpless, before making a move to use its hind claws to force the lion to release its hold on it
Tiger versus lion|tiger|Though the tiger was the aggressor this time, their struggle became more like that of dogs unable to beat each other
Tiger versus lion|tiger|They bled from nose to tail as they moved away from the witness, towards the creek
Tiger versus lion|tiger|They fell into the water, which was about 2 ft (61 cm) deep, and this stopped the fight
Tiger versus lion|tiger|They retreated from each other, limping into the forest.
Tiger versus lion|tiger|Battles between the two were painted in the 18th and 19th centuries by Eugène Delacroix, George Stubbs and James Ward
Tiger versus lion|tiger|James Ward's paintings portrayed lion victories in accordance with the lion's symbolic value in Britain, and have been described as less realistic than Stubbs.The British Seringapatam medal shows a lion defeating a tiger in battle; an Arabic language banner on the medal displays the words Asad Allāh al-Ghālib (Arabic
Tiger versus lion|tiger|"أَسَد الله الْغَالِب‎, ""Lion of God the Conqueror"")"
Tiger versus lion|tiger|The medal commemorated the British victory at the 1799 Battle of Seringapatam (in the town now known as Srirangapatna) over Tipu Sultan — who used tigers as emblems, as opposed to the British emblematic use of lions.
Tiger versus lion|tiger|18th-century naturalists and authors compared the species' characters, generally in favor of the lion
Tiger versus lion|tiger|"Oliver Goldsmith ranked the lion first among carnivorous mammals, followed by the tiger, which in his view ""seems to partake of all the noxious qualities of the lion, without sharing any of his good ones"
Tiger versus lion|tiger|"To pride, courage and strength, the lion joins greatness, clemency and generosity; but the tiger is fierce without provocation, and cruel without necessity."" Charles Knight, writing in The English Cyclopaedia, disparaged the opinions of naturalists Georges-Louis Leclerc, Comte de Buffon and Thomas Pennant in this context, stating ""the general herd of authors who eulogise the 'courage, greatness, clemency and generosity' of the lion, contrasting it with the unprovoked ferocity, unnecessary cruelty and poltroonery of the tiger, becomes ridiculous, though led by such names as Buffon and Pennant."""
Tiger versus lion|tiger|English literature compared their battle strengths
Tiger versus lion|tiger|The poets Edmund Spenser, Allan Ramsey, and Robert Southey described lion victories
Tiger versus lion|tiger|"In the view of a 19th-century literary critic, these contests established ""sovereignty of the animal world."""
Tiger versus lion|tiger|"According to John Hampden Porter (1894, page 176), Lockington said that the jaguar reigned 'supreme' as the ""terror of the forest,"" and that this applied to the lion and tiger in the 'desert' and 'jungle', respectively.In the Hindu epic Mahabharata, Narada told Srinjaya that tigers were fiercer and more ruthless than lions"
Tiger versus lion|tiger|This is in contrast with other literature from ancient India, which prefers the lion to the tiger
Tiger versus lion|tiger|"For example, Vedic literature depicted the lion, rather than the tiger, as the ""king of the forest"".The lion and tiger rival each other in Iranian literature"
Tiger versus lion|tiger|For example, Humphreys and Kahrom, in their 1999 book Lion and Gazelle
Tiger versus lion|tiger|"The Mammals and Birds of Iran, treated them as the ""two greatest and most beautiful"" of Iranian carnivores, albeit being extinct there"
Tiger versus lion|tiger|As with the lion, the tiger's Persian name was used for people and places.

Rabbit|rabbit|Rabbits, also known as bunnies or bunny rabbits, are small mammals in the family Leporidae (along with the hare) of the order Lagomorpha (along with the pika)
Rabbit|rabbit|Oryctolagus cuniculus includes the European rabbit species and its descendants, the world's 305 breeds of domestic rabbit
Rabbit|rabbit|Sylvilagus includes 13 wild rabbit species, among them the seven types of cottontail
Rabbit|rabbit|The European rabbit, which has been introduced on every continent except Antarctica, is familiar throughout the world as a wild prey animal and as a domesticated form of livestock and pet
Rabbit|rabbit|With its widespread effect on ecologies and cultures, the rabbit is, in many areas of the world, a part of daily life—as food, clothing, a companion, and a source of artistic inspiration.
Rabbit|rabbit|Male rabbits are called bucks; females are called does
Rabbit|rabbit|An older term for an adult rabbit used until the 18th century is coney (derived ultimately from the Latin cuniculus), while rabbit once referred only to the young animals
Rabbit|rabbit|Another term for a young rabbit is bunny, though this term is often applied informally (particularly by children) to rabbits generally, especially domestic ones
Rabbit|rabbit|More recently, the term kit or kitten has been used to refer to a young rabbit.
Rabbit|rabbit|A group of rabbits is known as a colony or nest (or, occasionally, a warren, though this more commonly refers to where the rabbits live)
Rabbit|rabbit|A group of baby rabbits produced from a single mating is referred to as a litter and a group of domestic rabbits living together is sometimes called a herd.The word rabbit itself derives from the Middle English rabet, a borrowing from the Walloon robète, which was a diminutive of the French or Middle Dutch robbe.
Rabbit|rabbit|Rabbits and hares were formerly classified in the order Rodentia (rodent) until 1912, when they were moved into a new order, Lagomorpha (which also includes pikas)
Rabbit|rabbit|Below are some of the genera and species of the rabbit.
Rabbit|rabbit|Hares are precocial, born relatively mature and mobile with hair and good vision, while rabbits are altricial, born hairless and blind, and requiring closer care
Rabbit|rabbit|Hares (and cottontail rabbits) live a relatively solitary life in a simple nest above the ground, while most rabbits live in social groups in burrows or warrens
Rabbit|rabbit|Hares are generally larger than rabbits, with ears that are more elongated, and with hind legs that are larger and longer
Rabbit|rabbit|Hares have not been domesticated, while descendants of the European rabbit are commonly bred as livestock and kept as pets.
Rabbit|rabbit|Rabbits have long been domesticated
Rabbit|rabbit|Beginning in the Middle Ages, the European rabbit has been widely kept as livestock, starting in ancient Rome
Rabbit|rabbit|Selective breeding has generated a wide variety of rabbit breeds, of which many (since the early 19th century) are also kept as pets
Rabbit|rabbit|Some strains of rabbit have been bred specifically as research subjects.
Rabbit|rabbit|As livestock, rabbits are bred for their meat and fur
Rabbit|rabbit|The earliest breeds were important sources of meat, and so became larger than wild rabbits, but domestic rabbits in modern times range in size from dwarf to giant
Rabbit|rabbit|Rabbit fur, prized for its softness, can be found in a broad range of coat colors and patterns, as well as lengths
Rabbit|rabbit|The Angora rabbit breed, for example, was developed for its long, silky fur, which is often hand-spun into yarn
Rabbit|rabbit|Other domestic rabbit breeds have been developed primarily for the commercial fur trade, including the Rex, which has a short plush coat.
Rabbit|rabbit|Because the rabbit's epiglottis is engaged over the soft palate except when swallowing, the rabbit is an obligate nasal breather
Rabbit|rabbit|Rabbits have two sets of incisor teeth, one behind the other
Rabbit|rabbit|This way they can be distinguished from rodents, with which they are often confused
Rabbit|rabbit|Carl Linnaeus originally grouped rabbits and rodents under the class Glires; later, they were separated as the scientific consensus is that many of their similarities were a result of convergent evolution
Rabbit|rabbit|However, recent DNA analysis and the discovery of a common ancestor has supported the view that they do share a common lineage, and thus rabbits and rodents are now often referred to together as members of the superorder Glires.
Rabbit|rabbit|Since speed and agility are a rabbit's main defenses against predators (including the swift fox), rabbits have large hind leg bones and well developed musculature
Rabbit|rabbit|Though plantigrade at rest, rabbits are on their toes while running, assuming a more digitigrade posture
Rabbit|rabbit|Rabbits use their strong claws for digging and (along with their teeth) for defense
Rabbit|rabbit|Each front foot has four toes plus a dewclaw
Rabbit|rabbit|Each hind foot has four toes (but no dewclaw).
Rabbit|rabbit|Most wild rabbits (especially compared to hares) have relatively full, egg-shaped bodies
Rabbit|rabbit|The soft coat of the wild rabbit is agouti in coloration (or, rarely, melanistic), which aids in camouflage
Rabbit|rabbit|The tail of the rabbit (with the exception of the cottontail species) is dark on top and white below
Rabbit|rabbit|Cottontails have white on the top of their tails.As a result of the position of the eyes in its skull, the rabbit has a field of vision that encompasses nearly 360 degrees, with just a small blind spot at the bridge of the nose.
Rabbit|rabbit|The anatomy of rabbits' hind limbs are structurally similar to that of other land mammals and contribute to their specialized form of locomotion
Rabbit|rabbit|The bones of the hind limbs consist of long bones (the femur, tibia, fibula, and phalanges) as well as short bones (the tarsals)
Rabbit|rabbit|These bones are created through endochondral ossification during development
Rabbit|rabbit|Like most land mammals, the round head of the femur articulates with the acetabulum of the ox coxae
Rabbit|rabbit|The femur articulates with the tibia, but not the fibula, which is fused to the tibia
Rabbit|rabbit|The tibia and fibula articulate with the tarsals of the pes, commonly called the foot
Rabbit|rabbit|The hind limbs of the rabbit are longer than the front limbs
Rabbit|rabbit|This allows them to produce their hopping form of locomotion
Rabbit|rabbit|Longer hind limbs are more capable of producing faster speeds
Rabbit|rabbit|Hares, which have longer legs than cottontail rabbits, are able to move considerably faster
Rabbit|rabbit|Rabbits stay just on their toes when moving; this is called Digitigrade locomotion
Rabbit|rabbit|The hind feet have four long toes that allow for this and are webbed to prevent them from spreading when hopping
Rabbit|rabbit|Rabbits do not have paw pads on their feet like most other animals that use digitigrade locomotion
Rabbit|rabbit|Instead, they have coarse compressed hair that offers protection.
Rabbit|rabbit|Rabbits have muscled hind legs that allow for maximum force, maneuverability, and acceleration that is divided into three main parts; foot, thigh, and leg
Rabbit|rabbit|The hind limbs of a rabbit are an exaggerated feature
Rabbit|rabbit|They are much longer than the forelimbs, providing more force
Rabbit|rabbit|Rabbits run on their toes to gain the optimal stride during locomotion
Rabbit|rabbit|The force put out by the hind limbs is contributed to both the structural anatomy of the fusion tibia and fibula, and muscular features
Rabbit|rabbit|Bone formation and removal, from a cellular standpoint, is directly correlated to hind limb muscles
Rabbit|rabbit|Action pressure from muscles creates force that is then distributed through the skeletal structures
Rabbit|rabbit|Rabbits that generate less force, putting less stress on bones are more prone to osteoporosis due to bone rarefaction
Rabbit|rabbit|In rabbits, the more fibers in a muscle, the more resistant to fatigue
Rabbit|rabbit|For example, hares have a greater resistance to fatigue than cottontails
Rabbit|rabbit|The muscles of rabbit's hind limbs can be classified into four main categories
Rabbit|rabbit|hamstrings, quadriceps, dorsiflexors, or plantar flexors
Rabbit|rabbit|The quadriceps muscles are in charge of force production when jumping
Rabbit|rabbit|Complementing these muscles are the hamstrings, which aid in short bursts of action
Rabbit|rabbit|These muscles play off of one another in the same way as the plantar flexors and dorsiflexors, contributing to the generation and actions associated with force.
Rabbit|rabbit|Within the order lagomorphs, the ears are utilized to detect and avoid predators
Rabbit|rabbit|In the family Leporidae, the ears are typically longer than they are wide
Rabbit|rabbit|For example, in black tailed jack rabbits, their long ears cover a greater surface area relative to their body size that allow them to detect predators from far away
Rabbit|rabbit|Contrasted to cotton tailed rabbits, their ears are smaller and shorter, requiring predators to be closer to detect them before they can flee
Rabbit|rabbit|Evolution has favored rabbits having shorter ears so the larger surface area does not cause them to lose heat in more temperate regions
Rabbit|rabbit|The opposite can be seen in rabbits that live in hotter climates, mainly because they possess longer ears that have a larger surface area that help with dispersion of heat as well as the theory that sound does not travel well in more arid air, opposed to cooler air
Rabbit|rabbit|Therefore, longer ears are meant to aid the organism in detecting predators sooner rather than later in warmer temperatures
Rabbit|rabbit|The rabbit is characterized by its shorter ears while hares are characterized by their longer ears
Rabbit|rabbit|Rabbits' ears are an important structure to aid thermoregulation and detect predators due to how the outer, middle, and inner ear muscles coordinate with one another
Rabbit|rabbit|The ear muscles also aid in maintaining balance and movement when fleeing predators.
Rabbit|rabbit|The auricle, also known as the pinna, is a rabbit's outer ear
Rabbit|rabbit|The rabbit's pinnae represent a fair part of the body surface area
Rabbit|rabbit|It is theorized that the ears aid in dispersion of heat at temperatures above 30 °C with rabbits in warmer climates having longer pinnae due to this
Rabbit|rabbit|Another theory is that the ears function as shock absorbers that could aid and stabilize rabbit's vision when fleeing predators, but this has typically only been seen in hares
Rabbit|rabbit|The rest of the outer ear has bent canals that lead to the eardrum or tympanic membrane.Middle ear
Rabbit|rabbit|The middle ear is filled with three bones called ossicles and is separated by the outer eardrum in the back of the rabbit's skull
Rabbit|rabbit|The three ossicles are called hammer, anvil, and stirrup and act to decrease sound before it hits the inner ear
Rabbit|rabbit|In general, the ossicles act as a barrier to the inner ear for sound energy.Inner ear
Rabbit|rabbit|Inner ear fluid called endolymph receives the sound energy
Rabbit|rabbit|After receiving the energy, later within the inner ear there are two parts
Rabbit|rabbit|the cochlea that  utilizes sound waves from the ossicles and the vestibular apparatus that manages the rabbit's position in regards to movement
Rabbit|rabbit|Within the cochlea there is a basilar membrane that contains sensory hair structures utilized to send nerve signals to the brain so it can recognize different sound frequencies
Rabbit|rabbit|Within the vestibular apparatus the rabbit possesses three semicircular canals to help detect angular motion.
Rabbit|rabbit|Thermoregulation is the process that an organism utilizes to maintain an optimal body temperature independent of external conditions
Rabbit|rabbit|This process is carried out by the pinnae, which takes up most of the rabbit's body surface and contain a vascular network and arteriovenous shunts
Rabbit|rabbit|In a rabbit, the optimal body temperature is around 38.5–40℃
Rabbit|rabbit|If their body temperature exceeds or does not meet this optimal temperature, the rabbit must return to homeostasis
Rabbit|rabbit|Homeostasis of body temperature is maintained by the use of their large, highly vascularized ears that are able to change the amount of blood flow that passes through the ears
Rabbit|rabbit|Constriction and dilation of blood vessels in the ears are used to control the core body temperature of a rabbit
Rabbit|rabbit|If the core temperature exceeds its optimal temperature greatly, blood flow is constricted to limit the amount of blood going through the vessels
Rabbit|rabbit|With this constriction, there is only a limited amount of blood that is passing through the ears where ambient heat would be able to heat the blood that is flowing through the ears and therefore, increasing the body temperature
Rabbit|rabbit|Constriction is also used when the ambient temperature is much lower than that of the rabbit's core body temperature
Rabbit|rabbit|When the ears are constricted it again limits blood flow through the ears to conserve the optimal body temperature of the rabbit
Rabbit|rabbit|If the ambient temperature is either 15 degrees above or below the optimal body temperature, the blood vessels will dilate
Rabbit|rabbit|With the blood vessels being enlarged, the blood is able to pass through the large surface area, causing it to either heat or cool down.
Rabbit|rabbit|During hot summers, the rabbit has the capability to stretch its pinnae, which allows for greater surface area and increase heat dissipation
Rabbit|rabbit|In cold winters, the rabbit does the opposite and folds its ears in order to decrease its surface area to the ambient air, which would decrease their body temperature.
Rabbit|rabbit|The jackrabbit has the largest ears within the Oryctolagus cuniculus group
Rabbit|rabbit|Their ears contribute to 17% of their total body surface area
Rabbit|rabbit|Their large pinna were evolved to maintain homeostasis while in the extreme temperatures of the desert.
Rabbit|rabbit|The rabbit's nasal cavity lies dorsal to the oral cavity, and the two compartments are separated by the hard and soft palate
Rabbit|rabbit|The nasal cavity itself is separated into a left and right side by a cartilage barrier, and it is covered in fine hairs that trap dust before it can enter the respiratory tract
Rabbit|rabbit|As the rabbit breathes, air flows in through the nostrils along the alar folds
Rabbit|rabbit|From there, the air moves into the nasal cavity, also known as the nasopharynx, down through the trachea, through the larynx, and into the lungs
Rabbit|rabbit|The larynx functions as the rabbit's voice box, which enables it to produce a wide variety of sounds
Rabbit|rabbit|The trachea is a long tube embedded with cartilaginous rings that prevent the tube from collapsing as air moves in and out of the lungs
Rabbit|rabbit|The trachea then splits into a left and right bronchus, which meet the lungs at a structure called the hilum
Rabbit|rabbit|From there, the bronchi split into progressively more narrow and numerous branches
Rabbit|rabbit|The bronchi branch into bronchioles, into respiratory bronchioles, and ultimately terminate at the alveolar ducts
Rabbit|rabbit|The branching that is typically found in rabbit lungs is a clear example of monopodial branching, in which smaller branches divide out laterally from a larger central branch.The structure of the rabbit's nasal and oral cavities, necessitates breathing through the nose
Rabbit|rabbit|This is due to the fact that the epiglottis is fixed to the backmost portion of the soft palate
Rabbit|rabbit|Within the oral cavity, a layer of tissue sits over the opening of the glottis, which blocks airflow from the oral cavity to the trachea
Rabbit|rabbit|The epiglottis functions to prevent the rabbit from aspirating on its food
Rabbit|rabbit|Further, the presence of a soft and hard palate allow the rabbit to breathe through its nose while it feeds.
Rabbit|rabbit|Rabbits lungs are divided into four lobes
Rabbit|rabbit|the cranial, middle, caudal, and accessory lobes
Rabbit|rabbit|The right lung is made up of all four lobes, while the left lung only has two
Rabbit|rabbit|the cranial and caudal lobes
Rabbit|rabbit|In order to provide space for the heart, the left cranial lobe of the lungs is significantly smaller than that of the right
Rabbit|rabbit|The diaphragm is a muscular structure that lies caudal to the lungs and contracts to facilitate respiration.
Rabbit|rabbit|Rabbits are herbivores that feed by grazing on grass and other leafy plants
Rabbit|rabbit|In consequence, their diet contains large amounts of cellulose, which is hard to digest
Rabbit|rabbit|Rabbits solve this problem via a form of hindgut fermentation
Rabbit|rabbit|They pass two distinct types of feces
Rabbit|rabbit|"hard droppings and soft black viscous pellets, the latter of which are known as caecotrophs or ""night droppings""  and are immediately eaten (a behaviour known as coprophagy)"
Rabbit|rabbit|Rabbits reingest their own droppings (rather than chewing the cud as do cows and numerous other herbivores) to digest their food further and extract sufficient nutrients.Rabbits graze heavily and rapidly for roughly the first half-hour of a grazing period (usually in the late afternoon), followed by about half an hour of more selective feeding
Rabbit|rabbit|In this time, the rabbit will also excrete many hard fecal pellets, being waste pellets that will not be reingested
Rabbit|rabbit|If the environment is relatively non-threatening, the rabbit will remain outdoors for many hours, grazing at intervals
Rabbit|rabbit|While out of the burrow, the rabbit will occasionally reingest its soft, partially digested pellets; this is rarely observed, since the pellets are reingested as they are produced.
Rabbit|rabbit|Hard pellets are made up of hay-like fragments of plant cuticle and stalk, being the final waste product after redigestion of soft pellets
Rabbit|rabbit|These are only released outside the burrow and are not reingested
Rabbit|rabbit|Soft pellets are usually produced several hours after grazing, after the hard pellets have all been excreted
Rabbit|rabbit|They are made up of micro-organisms and undigested plant cell walls.Rabbits are hindgut digesters
Rabbit|rabbit|This means that most of their digestion takes place in their large intestine and cecum
Rabbit|rabbit|In rabbits, the cecum is about 10 times bigger than the stomach and it along with the large intestine makes up roughly 40% of the rabbit's digestive tract
Rabbit|rabbit|The unique musculature of the cecum allows the intestinal tract of the rabbit to separate fibrous material from more digestible material; the fibrous material is passed as feces, while the more nutritious material is encased in a mucous lining as a cecotrope
Rabbit|rabbit|"Cecotropes, sometimes called ""night feces"", are high in minerals, vitamins and proteins that are necessary to the rabbit's health"
Rabbit|rabbit|Rabbits eat these to meet their nutritional requirements; the mucous coating allows the nutrients to pass through the acidic stomach for digestion in the intestines
Rabbit|rabbit|This process allows rabbits to extract the necessary nutrients from their food.The chewed plant material collects in the large cecum, a secondary chamber between the large and small intestine containing large quantities of symbiotic bacteria that help with the digestion of cellulose and also produce certain B vitamins
Rabbit|rabbit|The pellets are about 56% bacteria by dry weight, largely accounting for the pellets being 24.4% protein on average
Rabbit|rabbit|The soft feces form here and contain up to five times the vitamins of hard feces
Rabbit|rabbit|After being excreted, they are eaten whole by the rabbit and redigested in a special part of the stomach
Rabbit|rabbit|The pellets remain intact for up to six hours in the stomach; the bacteria within continue to digest the plant carbohydrates
Rabbit|rabbit|This double-digestion process enables rabbits to use nutrients that they may have missed during the first passage through the gut, as well as the nutrients formed by the microbial activity and thus ensures that maximum nutrition is derived from the food they eat
Rabbit|rabbit|This process serves the same purpose in the rabbit as rumination does in cattle and sheep.
Rabbit|rabbit|The adult male reproductive system forms the same as most mammals with the seminiferous tubular compartment containing the Sertoli cells and an adluminal compartment that contains the Leydig cells
Rabbit|rabbit|The Leydig cells produce testosterone, which maintains libido and creates secondary sex characteristics such as the genital tubercle and penis
Rabbit|rabbit|The Sertoli cells triggers the production of Anti-Müllerian duct hormone, which absorbs the Müllerian duct
Rabbit|rabbit|In an adult male rabbit, the sheath of the penis is cylinder-like and can be extruded as early as two months of age
Rabbit|rabbit|The scrotal sacs lay lateral to the penis and contain epididymal fat pads which protect the testes
Rabbit|rabbit|Between 10 and 14 weeks, the testes descend and are able to retract into the pelvic cavity in order to thermoregulate
Rabbit|rabbit|Furthermore, the secondary sex characteristics, such as the testes, are complex and secrete many compounds
Rabbit|rabbit|These compounds includes fructose, citric acid, minerals, and a uniquely high amount of catalase.
Rabbit|rabbit|The adult female reproductive tract is bipartite, which prevents an embryo from translocating between uteri
Rabbit|rabbit|The two uterine horns communicate to two cervixes and forms one vaginal canal
Rabbit|rabbit|Along with being bipartite, the female rabbit does not go through an estrus cycle, which causes mating induced ovulation.The average female rabbit becomes sexually mature at 3 to 8 months of age and can conceive at any time of the year for the duration of her life
Rabbit|rabbit|However, egg and sperm production can begin to decline after three years
Rabbit|rabbit|During mating, the male rabbit will mount the female rabbit from behind and insert his penis into the female and make rapid pelvic hip thrusts
Rabbit|rabbit|The encounter lasts only 20–40 seconds and after, the male will throw himself backwards off the female.The rabbit gestation period is short and ranges from 28 to 36 days with an average period of 31 days
Rabbit|rabbit|A longer gestation period will generally yield a smaller litter while shorter gestation periods will give birth to a larger litter
Rabbit|rabbit|The size of a single litter can range from four to 12 kits allowing a female to deliver up to 60 new kits a year
Rabbit|rabbit|After birth, the female can become pregnant again as early as the next dayThe mortality rates of embryos are high in rabbits and can be due to infection, trauma, poor nutrition and environmental stress so a high fertility rate is necessary to counter this.
Rabbit|rabbit|Rabbits may appear to be crepuscular, but their natural inclination is toward nocturnal activity
Rabbit|rabbit|In 2011, the average sleep time of a rabbit in captivity was calculated at 8.4 hours per day
Rabbit|rabbit|As with other prey animals, rabbits often sleep with their eyes open, so that sudden movements will awaken the rabbit to respond to potential danger.
Rabbit|rabbit|"In addition to being at risk of disease from common pathogens such as Bordetella bronchiseptica and Escherichia coli, rabbits can contract the virulent, species-specific viruses RHD (""rabbit hemorrhagic disease"", a form of calicivirus) or myxomatosis"
Rabbit|rabbit|Among the parasites that infect rabbits are tapeworms (such as Taenia serialis), external parasites (including fleas and mites), coccidia species, and Toxoplasma gondii
Rabbit|rabbit|Domesticated rabbits with a diet lacking in high fiber sources, such as hay and grass, are susceptible to potentially lethal gastrointestinal stasis
Rabbit|rabbit|Rabbits and hares are almost never found to be infected with rabies and have not been known to transmit rabies to humans.Encephalitozoon cuniculi, an obligate intracellular parasite is also capable of infecting many mammals including rabbits.
Rabbit|rabbit|Rabbits are prey animals and are therefore constantly aware of their surroundings
Rabbit|rabbit|For instance, in Mediterranean Europe, rabbits are the main prey of red foxes, badgers, and Iberian lynxes
Rabbit|rabbit|If confronted by a potential threat, a rabbit may freeze and observe then warn others in the warren with powerful thumps on the ground
Rabbit|rabbit|Rabbits have a remarkably wide field of vision, and a good deal of it is devoted to overhead scanning
Rabbit|rabbit|They survive predation by burrowing, hopping away in a zig-zag motion, and, if captured, delivering powerful kicks with their hind legs
Rabbit|rabbit|Their strong teeth allow them to eat and to bite in order to escape a struggle
Rabbit|rabbit|The longest-lived rabbit on record, a domesticated European rabbit living in Tasmania, died at age 18
Rabbit|rabbit|The lifespan of wild rabbits is much shorter; the average longevity of an eastern cottontail, for instance, is less than one year.
Rabbit|rabbit|Rabbit habitats include meadows, woods, forests, grasslands, deserts and wetlands
Rabbit|rabbit|Rabbits live in groups, and the best known species, the European rabbit, lives in burrows, or rabbit holes
Rabbit|rabbit|A group of burrows is called a warren.More than half the world's rabbit population resides in North America
Rabbit|rabbit|They are also native to southwestern Europe, Southeast Asia, Sumatra, some islands of Japan, and in parts of Africa and South America
Rabbit|rabbit|They are not naturally found in most of Eurasia, where a number of species of hares are present
Rabbit|rabbit|Rabbits first entered South America relatively recently, as part of the Great American Interchange
Rabbit|rabbit|Much of the continent has just one species of rabbit, the tapeti, while most of South America's southern cone is without rabbits.
Rabbit|rabbit|Rabbits have been a source of environmental problems when introduced into the wild by humans
Rabbit|rabbit|As a result of their appetites, and the rate at which they breed, feral rabbit depredation can be problematic for agriculture
Rabbit|rabbit|Gassing (fumigation of warrens), barriers (fences), shooting, snaring, and ferreting have been used to control rabbit populations, but the most effective measures are diseases such as myxomatosis (myxo or mixi, colloquially) and calicivirus
Rabbit|rabbit|In Europe, where rabbits are farmed on a large scale, they are protected against myxomatosis and calicivirus with a genetically modified virus
Rabbit|rabbit|The virus was developed in Spain, and is beneficial to rabbit farmers
Rabbit|rabbit|If it were to make its way into wild populations in areas such as Australia, it could create a population boom, as those diseases are the most serious threats to rabbit survival
Rabbit|rabbit|Rabbits in Australia and New Zealand are considered to be such a pest that land owners are legally obliged to control them.
Rabbit|rabbit|In some areas, wild rabbits and hares are hunted for their meat, a lean source of high quality protein
Rabbit|rabbit|In the wild, such hunting is accomplished with the aid of trained falcons, ferrets, or dogs, as well as with snares or other traps, and rifles
Rabbit|rabbit|A caught rabbit may be dispatched with a sharp blow to the back of its head, a practice from which the term rabbit punch is derived.
Rabbit|rabbit|Wild leporids comprise a small portion of global rabbit-meat consumption
Rabbit|rabbit|Domesticated descendants of the European rabbit (Oryctolagus cuniculus) that are bred and kept as livestock (a practice called cuniculture) account for the estimated 200 million tons of rabbit meat produced annually
Rabbit|rabbit|Approximately 1.2 billion rabbits are slaughtered each year for meat worldwide
Rabbit|rabbit|In 1994, the countries with the highest consumption per capita of rabbit meat were Malta with 8.89 kg (19 lb 10 oz), Italy with 5.71 kg (12 lb 9 oz), and Cyprus with 4.37 kg (9 lb 10 oz), falling to 0.03 kg (1 oz) in Japan
Rabbit|rabbit|The figure for the United States was 0.14 kg (5 oz) per capita
Rabbit|rabbit|The largest producers of rabbit meat in 1994 were China, Russia, Italy, France, and Spain
Rabbit|rabbit|Rabbit meat was once a common commodity in Sydney, Australia, but declined after the myxomatosis virus was intentionally introduced to control the exploding population of feral rabbits in the area.
Rabbit|rabbit|In the United Kingdom, fresh rabbit is sold in butcher shops and markets, and some supermarkets sell frozen rabbit meat
Rabbit|rabbit|At farmers markets there, including the famous Borough Market in London, rabbit carcasses are sometimes displayed hanging, unbutchered (in the traditional style), next to braces of pheasant or other small game
Rabbit|rabbit|"Rabbit meat is a feature of Moroccan cuisine, where it is cooked in a tajine with ""raisins and grilled almonds added a few minutes before serving"""
Rabbit|rabbit|In China, rabbit meat is particularly popular in Sichuan cuisine, with its stewed rabbit, spicy diced rabbit, BBQ-style rabbit, and even spicy rabbit heads, which have been compared to spicy duck neck
Rabbit|rabbit|Rabbit meat is comparatively unpopular elsewhere in the Asia-Pacific.
Rabbit|rabbit|An extremely rare infection associated with rabbits-as-food is tularemia (also known as rabbit fever), which may be contracted from an infected rabbit
Rabbit|rabbit|Hunters are at higher risk for tularemia because of the potential for inhaling the bacteria during the skinning process.
Rabbit|rabbit|In addition to their meat, rabbits are used for their wool, fur, and pelts, as well as their nitrogen-rich manure and their high-protein milk
Rabbit|rabbit|Production industries have developed domesticated rabbit breeds (such as the well-known Angora rabbit) to efficiently fill these needs.
Rabbit|rabbit|Rabbits are often used as a symbol of fertility or rebirth, and have long been associated with spring and Easter as the Easter Bunny
Rabbit|rabbit|The species' role as a prey animal with few defenses evokes vulnerability and innocence, and in folklore and modern children's stories, rabbits often appear as sympathetic characters, able to connect easily with youth of all kinds (for example, the Velveteen Rabbit, or Thumper in Bambi).
Rabbit|rabbit|With its reputation as a prolific breeder, the rabbit juxtaposes sexuality with innocence, as in the Playboy Bunny
Rabbit|rabbit|The rabbit (as a swift prey animal) is also known for its speed, agility, and endurance, symbolized (for example) by the marketing icons the Energizer Bunny and the Duracell Bunny.
Rabbit|rabbit|In Chinese folklore, rabbits accompany Chang'e on the Moon
Rabbit|rabbit|In the Chinese New Year, the zodiacal rabbit is one of the twelve celestial animals in the Chinese zodiac
Rabbit|rabbit|Note that the Vietnamese zodiac includes a zodiacal cat in place of the rabbit, possibly because rabbits did not inhabit Vietnam
Rabbit|rabbit|"The most common explanation, however, is that the ancient Vietnamese word for ""rabbit"" (mao) sounds like the Chinese word for ""cat"" (卯, mao)."
Rabbit|rabbit|In Japanese tradition, rabbits live on the Moon where they make mochi, the popular snack of mashed sticky rice
Rabbit|rabbit|This comes from interpreting the pattern of dark patches on the moon as a rabbit standing on tiptoes on the left pounding on an usu, a Japanese mortar.
Rabbit|rabbit|A Vietnamese mythological story portrays the rabbit of innocence and youthfulness
Rabbit|rabbit|The Gods of the myth are shown to be hunting and killing rabbits to show off their power.
Rabbit|rabbit|"Buddhism, Christianity, and Judaism have associations with an ancient circular motif called the three rabbits (or ""three hares"")"
Rabbit|rabbit|"Its meaning ranges from ""peace and tranquility"", to purity or the Holy Trinity, to Kabbalistic levels of the soul or to the Jewish diaspora"
Rabbit|rabbit|The tripartite symbol also appears in heraldry and even tattoos.The rabbit as trickster is a part of American popular culture, as Br'er Rabbit (from African-American folktales and, later, Disney animation) and Bugs Bunny (the cartoon character from Warner Bros.), for example.
Rabbit|rabbit|Anthropomorphized rabbits have appeared in film and literature, in Alice's Adventures in Wonderland (the White Rabbit and the March Hare characters), in Watership Down (including the film and television adaptations), in Rabbit Hill (by Robert Lawson), and in the Peter Rabbit stories (by Beatrix Potter)
Rabbit|rabbit|In the 1920s, Oswald the Lucky Rabbit, was a popular cartoon character.
Rabbit|rabbit|A rabbit's foot may be carried as an amulet, believed to bring protection and good luck
Rabbit|rabbit|This belief is found in many parts of the world, with the earliest use being recorded in Europe c
Rabbit|rabbit|600 BC.On the Isle of Portland in Dorset, UK, the rabbit is said to be unlucky and even speaking the creature's name can cause upset among older island residents
Rabbit|rabbit|This is thought to date back to early times in the local quarrying industry where (to save space) extracted stones that were not fit for sale were set aside in what became tall, unstable walls
Rabbit|rabbit|The local rabbits' tendency to burrow there would weaken the walls and their collapse resulted in injuries or even death
Rabbit|rabbit|Thus, invoking the name of the culprit became an unlucky act to be avoided
Rabbit|rabbit|In the local culture to this day, the rabbit (when he has to be referred to) may instead be called a “long ears” or “underground mutton”, so as not to risk bringing a downfall upon oneself
Rabbit|rabbit|"While it was true 50 years ago that a pub on the island could be emptied by calling out the word ""rabbit"", this has become more fable than fact in modern times.In other parts of Britain and in North America, invoking the rabbit's name may instead bring good luck"
Rabbit|rabbit|"""Rabbit rabbit rabbit"" is one variant of an apotropaic or talismanic superstition that involves saying or repeating the word ""rabbit"" (or ""rabbits"" or ""white rabbits"" or some combination thereof) out loud upon waking on the first day of each month, because doing so will ensure good fortune for the duration of that month."
Rabbit|rabbit|"The ""rabbit test"" is a term, first used in 1949, for the Friedman test, an early diagnostic tool for detecting a pregnancy in humans"
Rabbit|rabbit|It is a common misconception (or perhaps an urban legend) that the test-rabbit would die if the woman was pregnant
Rabbit|rabbit|"This led to the phrase ""the rabbit died"" becoming a euphemism for a positive pregnancy test."

Rabbit|rabbit|The Symbolism of Rabbits and Hares
Dragon|dragon|A dragon is a large, serpentine, legendary creature that appears in the folklore of many cultures worldwide
Dragon|dragon|Beliefs about dragons vary considerably through regions, but dragons in western cultures since the High Middle Ages have often been depicted as winged, horned, four-legged, and capable of breathing fire
Dragon|dragon|Dragons in eastern cultures are usually depicted as wingless, four-legged, serpentine creatures with above-average intelligence.
Dragon|dragon|The earliest attested reports of draconic creatures resemble giant snakes
Dragon|dragon|Draconic creatures are first described in the mythologies of the ancient Near East and appear in ancient Mesopotamian art and literature
Dragon|dragon|Stories about storm-gods slaying giant serpents occur throughout nearly all Indo-European and Near Eastern mythologies
Dragon|dragon|Famous prototypical draconic creatures include the mušḫuššu of ancient Mesopotamia; Apep in Egyptian mythology; Vṛtra in the Rigveda; the Leviathan in the Hebrew Bible; Grand'Goule in the Poitou region in France; Python, Ladon, Wyvern, and the Lernaean Hydra in Greek mythology; Jörmungandr, Níðhöggr, and Fafnir in Norse mythology; and the dragon from Beowulf.
Dragon|dragon|The popular western image of a dragon is likely based on a conflation of earlier dragons from different traditions, and of inaccurate scribal drawings of snakes
Dragon|dragon|In western cultures, dragons are portrayed as monsters to be tamed or overcome, usually by saints or culture heroes, as in the popular legend of Saint George and the Dragon
Dragon|dragon|They are often said to have ravenous appetites and to live in caves, where they hoard treasure
Dragon|dragon|These dragons appear frequently in western fantasy literature, including The Hobbit by J
Dragon|dragon|R
Dragon|dragon|R
Dragon|dragon|Tolkien, the Harry Potter series by J
Dragon|dragon|K
Dragon|dragon|Rowling, and A Song of Ice and Fire by George R

Dragon|dragon|"The word ""dragon"" has also come to be applied to the legendary creature in Chinese mythology, loong (traditional 龍, simplified 龙, Japanese simplified 竜, Pinyin lóng), which is associated with good fortune and is thought to have power over rain"
Dragon|dragon|Dragons and their associations with rain are the source of the Chinese customs of dragon dancing and dragon boat racing
Dragon|dragon|Many East Asian deities and demigods have dragons as their personal mounts or companions
Dragon|dragon|Dragons were also identified with the Emperor of China, who, during later Chinese imperial history, was the only one permitted to have dragons on his house, clothing, or personal articles.
Dragon|dragon|The impression of dragons in a large number of Asian countries has been influenced by Chinese culture, such as Korea, Vietnam, Japan and so on
Dragon|dragon|"Chinese tradition has always used the dragon totem as the national emblem, and the ""Yellow Dragon flag"" of the Qing Dynasty has influenced the impression that China is a dragon in many European countries"
Dragon|dragon|The white dragon of the flag of modern Bhutan is a very classic Chinese style dragon.Commonalities between dragons' traits are often a hybridization of feline, avian, and reptilian features, and may include
Dragon|dragon|snakelike features, reptilian scaly skin, four legs with three or four toes on each, spinal nodes running down the back, a tail, and a serrated jaw with rows of teeth
Dragon|dragon|Several modern scholars believe huge extinct or migrating crocodiles bear the closest resemblance, especially when encountered in forested or swampy areas, and are most likely the template of modern dragon imagery.
Dragon|dragon|The word dragon entered the English language in the early 13th century from Old French dragon, which in turn comes from Latin
Dragon|dragon|"draconem (nominative draco) meaning ""huge serpent, dragon"", from Ancient Greek δράκων, drákōn (genitive δράκοντος, drákontos) ""serpent, giant seafish"""
Dragon|dragon|The Greek and Latin term referred to any great serpent, not necessarily mythological
Dragon|dragon|"The Greek word δράκων is most likely derived from the Greek verb δέρκομαι (dérkomai) meaning ""I see"", the aorist form of which is ἔδρακον (édrakon)"
Dragon|dragon|"This is thought to have referred to something with a ""deadly glance,"" or unusually bright or ""sharp"" eyes, or because a snake's eyes appear to be always open; each eye actually sees through a big transparent scale in its eyelids, which are permanently shut"
Dragon|dragon|"The Greek word probably derives from an Indo-European base *derḱ- meaning ""to see""; the Sanskrit root दृश् (dr̥ś-) also means ""to see""."
Dragon|dragon|Draconic creatures appear in virtually all cultures around the globe
Dragon|dragon|Nonetheless, scholars dispute where the idea of a dragon originates from and a wide variety of hypotheses have been proposed.In his book An Instinct for Dragons (2000), anthropologist David E
Dragon|dragon|Jones suggests a hypothesis that humans, like monkeys, have inherited instinctive reactions to snakes, large cats, and birds of prey
Dragon|dragon|He cites a study which found that approximately 39 people in a hundred are afraid of snakes and notes that fear of snakes is especially prominent in children, even in areas where snakes are rare
Dragon|dragon|The earliest attested dragons all resemble snakes or have snakelike attributes
Dragon|dragon|Jones therefore concludes that dragons appear in nearly all cultures because humans have an innate fear of snakes and other animals that were major predators of humans' primate ancestors
Dragon|dragon|"Dragons are usually said to reside in ""dank caves, deep pools, wild mountain reaches, sea bottoms, haunted forests"", all places which would have been fraught with danger for early human ancestors.In her book The First Fossil Hunters"
Dragon|dragon|Dinosaurs, Mammoths, and Myth in Greek and Roman Times (2000), Adrienne Mayor argues that some stories of dragons may have been inspired by ancient discoveries of fossils belonging to dinosaurs and other prehistoric animals
Dragon|dragon|"She argues that the dragon lore of northern India may have been inspired by ""observations of oversized, extraordinary bones in the fossilbeds of the Siwalik Hills below the Himalayas"" and that ancient Greek artistic depictions of the Monster of Troy may have been influenced by fossils of Samotherium, an extinct species of giraffe whose fossils are common in the Mediterranean region"
Dragon|dragon|"In China, a region where fossils of large prehistoric animals are common, these remains are frequently identified as ""dragon bones"" and are commonly used in traditional Chinese medicine"
Dragon|dragon|"Mayor, however, is careful to point out that not all stories of dragons and giants are inspired by fossils and notes that Scandinavia has many stories of dragons and sea monsters, but has long ""been considered barren of large fossils."" In one of her later books, she states that ""Many dragon images around the world were based on folk knowledge or exaggerations of living reptiles, such as Komodo dragons, Gila monsters, iguanas, alligators, or, in California, alligator lizards, though this still fails to account for the Scandinavian legends, as no such animals (historical or otherwise) have ever been found in this region.""Robert Blust in The Origin Of Dragons (2000) argues that, like many other creations of traditional cultures, dragons are largely explicable as products of a convergence of rational pre-scientific speculation about the world of real events"
Dragon|dragon|In this case, the event is the natural mechanism governing rainfall and drought, with particular attention paid to the phenomenon of the rainbow.
Dragon|dragon|In Egyptian mythology, Apep is a giant serpentine creature who resides in the Duat, the Egyptian Underworld
Dragon|dragon|The Bremner-Rhind papyrus, written in around 310 BC, preserves an account of a much older Egyptian tradition that the setting of the sun is caused by Ra descending to the Duat to battle Apep
Dragon|dragon|In some accounts, Apep is as long as the height of eight men with a head made of flint
Dragon|dragon|Thunderstorms and earthquakes were thought to be caused by Apep's roar and solar eclipses were thought to be the result of Apep attacking Ra during the daytime
Dragon|dragon|In some myths, Apep is slain by the god Set
Dragon|dragon|Nehebkau is another giant serpent who guards the Duat and aided Ra in his battle against Apep
Dragon|dragon|Nehebkau was so massive in some stories that the entire earth was believed to rest atop his coils
Dragon|dragon|Denwen is a giant serpent mentioned in the Pyramid Texts whose body was made of fire and who ignited a conflagration that nearly destroyed all the gods of the Egyptian pantheon
Dragon|dragon|He was ultimately defeated by the Pharaoh, a victory which affirmed the Pharaoh's divine right to rule.The ouroboros was a well-known Egyptian symbol of a serpent swallowing its own tail
Dragon|dragon|"The precursor to the ouroboros was the ""Many-Faced"", a serpent with five heads, who, according to the Amduat, the oldest surviving Book of the Afterlife, was said to coil around the corpse of the sun god Ra protectively"
Dragon|dragon|"The earliest surviving depiction of a ""true"" ouroboros comes from the gilded shrines in the tomb of Tutankhamun"
Dragon|dragon|"In the early centuries AD, the ouroboros was adopted as a symbol by Gnostic Christians and chapter 136 of the Pistis Sophia, an early Gnostic text, describes ""a great dragon whose tail is in its mouth"""
Dragon|dragon|In medieval alchemy, the ouroboros became a typical western dragon with wings, legs, and a tail
Dragon|dragon|A famous image of the dragon gnawing on its tail from the eleventh-century Codex Marcianus was copied in numerous works on alchemy.
Dragon|dragon|Archaeologist Zhōu Chong-Fa believes that the Chinese word for dragon is an onomatopoeia of the sound of thunder or lùhng in Cantonese.The Chinese dragon (simplified Chinese
Dragon|dragon|龙; traditional Chinese
Dragon|dragon|龍; pinyin
Dragon|dragon|lóng) is the highest-ranking creature in the Chinese animal hierarchy
Dragon|dragon|"Its origins are vague, but its ""ancestors can be found on Neolithic pottery as well as Bronze Age ritual vessels."" A number of popular stories deal with the rearing of dragons"
Dragon|dragon|The Zuo zhuan, which was probably written during the Warring States period, describes a man named Dongfu, a descendant of Yangshu'an, who loved dragons and, because he could understand a dragon's will, he was able to tame them and raise them well
Dragon|dragon|"He served Emperor Shun, who gave him the family name Huanlong, meaning ""dragon-raiser"""
Dragon|dragon|In another story, Kongjia, the fourteenth emperor of the Xia dynasty, was given a male and a female dragon as a reward for his obedience to the god of heaven, but could not train them, so he hired a dragon-trainer named Liulei, who had learned how to train dragons from Huanlong
Dragon|dragon|One day, the female dragon died unexpectedly, so Liulei secretly chopped her up, cooked her meat, and served it to the king, who loved it so much that he demanded Liulei to serve him the same meal again
Dragon|dragon|Since Liulei had no means of procuring more dragon meat, he fled the palace.The image of the Chinese dragon was roughly established in the Shang and Zhou dynasties, but there was no great change for a long time
Dragon|dragon|In the Han Dynasty, Yinglong, as a symbol of feudal imperial power, frequently appeared in Royal Dragon vessels, which means that most of the dragon image designs used by the royal family in the Han Dynasty are Yinglong patterns.Yinglong is a winged dragon in ancient Chinese legend
Dragon|dragon|At present, the literature records of Yinglong's winged image can be tested from “Guangya（广雅）” during the Three Kingdoms period, but Yinglong's winged design has been found in bronze ware from the Shang and Zhou Dynasties to stone carvings, silk paintings and lacquerware of the Han Dynasty.The literature records of Yinglong can be traced back to the documents of the pre-Qin period, such as “Classic of Mountains and Seas”、“Chuci”and so on
Dragon|dragon|According to the records in “Classic of Mountains and Seas”,the Chinese mythology in 2200 years ago, Ying long had the main characteristics of later Chinese dragons - the power to control the sky and the noble mythical status.However, since the Tang and Song Dynasties, the image of the real dragon symbolizing China's imperial power was no longer the Yinglong with wings, but the common wingless Yellow Dragon in modern times.For the evolution of Yinglong and Huanglong(Yellow Dragon）, Scholar Chen Zheng proposed in “Yinglong - the origin of the image of the real dragon” that from the middle of the Zhou Dynasty, Yinglong's wings gradually became the form of flame pattern and cloud pattern at the dragon's shoulder in artistic creation, which derived the wingeless long snake shape
Dragon|dragon|The image of Huanglong was used together with the winged Yinglong
Dragon|dragon|Since then, with a series of wars, Chinese civilization suffered heavy losses, resulting in the forgetting of the image of winged Yinglong, and the image of wingless Yellow Dragon replaced the original Yinglong and became the real dragon symbolizing China's imperial power.On this basis, scholars Xiao Congrong put forward that the simplified artistic creation of Ying Long's wings by Chinese ancestors is a continuous process, that is, the simplification of dragon's wings is an irreversible trend
Dragon|dragon|"Xiao Congrong believes that the phenomenon of ""Yellow Dragon"" Replacing ""Ying Long"" can not be avoided regardless of whether Chinese civilization has suffered disaster or not.One of the most famous dragon stories is about the Lord Ye Gao, who loved dragons obsessively, even though he had never seen one"
Dragon|dragon|He decorated his whole house with dragon motifs and, seeing this display of admiration, a real dragon came and visited Ye Gao, but the lord was so terrified at the sight of the creature that he ran away
Dragon|dragon|In Chinese legend, the culture hero Fu Hsi is said to have been crossing the Lo River, when he saw the lung ma, a Chinese horse-dragon with seven dots on its face, six on its back, eight on its left flank, and nine on its right flank
Dragon|dragon|He was so moved by this apparition that, when he arrived home, he drew a picture of it, including the dots
Dragon|dragon|He later used these dots as letters and invented Chinese writing, which he used to write his book I Ching
Dragon|dragon|In another Chinese legend, the physician Ma Shih Huang is said to have healed a sick dragon
Dragon|dragon|Another legend reports that a man once came to the healer Lo Chên-jen, telling him that he was a dragon and that he needed to be healed
Dragon|dragon|After Lo Chên-jen healed the man, a dragon appeared to him and carried him to heaven.In the Shanhaijing, a classic mythography probably compiled mostly during the Han dynasty, various deities and demigods are associated with dragons
Dragon|dragon|"One of the most famous Chinese dragons is Ying Long (""responding dragon""), who helped the Huangdi, the Yellow Emperor, defeat the tyrant Chiyou"
Dragon|dragon|"The dragon Zhulong (""torch dragon"") is a god ""who composed the universe with his body."" In the Shanhaijing, many mythic heroes are said to have been conceived after their mothers copulated with divine dragons, including Huangdi, Shennong, Emperor Yao, and Emperor Shun"
Dragon|dragon|The god Zhurong and the emperor Qi are both described as being carried by two dragons, as are Huangdi, Zhuanxu, Yuqiang, and Roshou in various other texts
Dragon|dragon|According to the Huainanzi, an evil black dragon once caused a destructive deluge, which was ended by the mother goddess Nüwa by slaying the dragon.
Dragon|dragon|A large number of ethnic myths about dragons are told throughout China
Dragon|dragon|The Houhanshu, compiled in the fifth century BC by Fan Ye, reports a story belonging to the Ailaoyi people, which holds that a woman named Shayi who lived in the region around Mount Lao became pregnant with ten sons after being touched by a tree trunk floating in the water while fishing
Dragon|dragon|She gave birth to the sons and the tree trunk turned into a dragon, who asked to see his sons
Dragon|dragon|"The woman showed them to him, but all of them ran away except for the youngest, who the dragon licked on the back and named Jiu Long, meaning ""sitting back"""
Dragon|dragon|The sons later elected him king and the descendants of the ten sons became the Ailaoyi people, who tattooed dragons on their backs in honor of their ancestor
Dragon|dragon|The Miao people of southwest China have a story that a divine dragon created the first humans by breathing on monkeys that came to play in his cave
Dragon|dragon|The Han people have many stories about Short-Tailed Old Li, a black dragon who was born to a poor family in Shandong
Dragon|dragon|When his mother saw him for the first time, she fainted and, when his father came home from the field and saw him, he hit him with a spade and cut off part of his tail
Dragon|dragon|Li burst through the ceiling and flew away to the Black Dragon River in northeast China, where he became the god of that river
Dragon|dragon|On the anniversary of his mother's death on the Chinese lunar calendar, Old Li returns home, causing it to rain
Dragon|dragon|He is still worshipped as a rain god.
Dragon|dragon|In China, dragons are closely associated with rain and drought is thought to be caused by a dragon's laziness
Dragon|dragon|Prayers invoking dragons to bring rain are common in Chinese texts
Dragon|dragon|The Luxuriant Dew of the Spring and Autumn Annals, attributed to the Han dynasty scholar Dong Zhongshu, prescribes making clay figurines of dragons during a time of drought and having young men and boys pace and dance among the figurines in order to encourage the dragons to bring rain
Dragon|dragon|Texts from the Qing dynasty advise hurling the bone of a tiger or dirty objects into the pool where the dragon lives; since dragons cannot stand tigers or dirt, the dragon of the pool will cause heavy rain to drive the object out
Dragon|dragon|Rainmaking rituals invoking dragons are still very common in many Chinese villages, where each village has its own god said to bring rain and many of these gods are dragons
Dragon|dragon|Although stories of the Dragon Kings are among the most popular dragon stories in China today, these stories did not begin to emerge until the Eastern Han, when Buddhist stories of the serpent rain-god Nāga became popular
Dragon|dragon|Taoists began to invent their own dragon kings and eventually such stories developed in every major Chinese religion
Dragon|dragon|According to these stories, every body of water is ruled by a dragon king, each with a different power, rank, and ability, so people began establishing temples across the countryside dedicated to these figures.
Dragon|dragon|Many traditional Chinese customs revolve around dragons
Dragon|dragon|During various holidays, including the Spring Festival and Lantern Festival, villagers will construct an approximately sixteen-foot-long dragon from grass, cloth, bamboo strips, and paper, which they will parade through the city as part of a dragon dance
Dragon|dragon|The original purpose of this ritual was to bring good weather and a strong harvest, but now it is done mostly only for entertainment
Dragon|dragon|During the Duanwu festival, several villages, or even a whole province, will hold a dragon boat race, in which people race across a body of water in boats carved to look like dragons, while a large audience watches on the banks
Dragon|dragon|The custom is traditionally said to have originated after the poet Qu Yuan committed suicide by drowning himself in the Miluo River and people raced out in boats hoping to save him, but most historians agree that the custom actually originated much earlier as a ritual to avert ill fortune
Dragon|dragon|Starting during the Han dynasty and continuing until the Qing dynasty, the Chinese emperor gradually became closely identified with dragons, and emperors themselves claimed to be the incarnations of a divine dragon
Dragon|dragon|Eventually, dragons were only allowed to appear on clothing, houses, and articles of everyday use belonging to the emperor and any commoner who possessed everyday items bearing the image of the dragon were ordered to be executed
Dragon|dragon|After the last Chinese emperor was overthrown in 1911, this situation changed and now many ordinary Chinese people identify themselves as descendants of dragons.
Dragon|dragon|The Korean dragon is in many ways similar in appearance to other East Asian dragons such as the Chinese and Japanese dragons
Dragon|dragon|It differs from the Chinese dragon in that it developed a longer beard
Dragon|dragon|Very occasionally a dragon may be depicted as carrying an orb known as the Yeouiju (여의주), the Korean name for the mythical Cintamani, in its claws or its mouth
Dragon|dragon|It was said that whoever could wield the Yeouiju was blessed with the abilities of omnipotence and creation at will, and that only four-toed dragons (who had thumbs with which to hold the orbs) were both wise and powerful enough to wield these orbs, as opposed to the lesser, three-toed dragons
Dragon|dragon|As with China, the number nine is significant and auspicious in Korea, and dragons were said to have 81 (9×9) scales on their backs, representing yang essence
Dragon|dragon|Dragons in Korean mythology are primarily benevolent beings related to water and agriculture, often considered bringers of rain and clouds
Dragon|dragon|Hence, many Korean dragons are said to have resided in rivers, lakes, oceans, or even deep mountain ponds
Dragon|dragon|And human journeys to undersea realms, and especially the undersea palace of the Dragon King (용왕), are common in Korean folklore.In Korean myths, some kings who founded kingdoms were described as descendants of dragons because the dragon was a symbol of the monarch
Dragon|dragon|Lady Aryeong, who was the first queen of Silla is said to have been born from a cockatrice, while the grandmother of Taejo of Goryeo, founder of Goryeo, was reportedly the daughter of the dragon king of the West Sea
Dragon|dragon|And King Munmu of Silla, who on his deathbed wished to become a dragon of the East Sea in order to protect the kingdom
Dragon|dragon|Dragon patterns were used exclusively by the royal family
Dragon|dragon|The royal robe was also called the dragon robe (용포)
Dragon|dragon|In Joseon Dynasty, the royal insignia, featuring embroidered dragons, were attached to the robe's shoulders, the chest, and back
Dragon|dragon|The King wore five-taloned dragon insignia while the Crown Prince wore four-taloned dragon insignia.Korean folk mythology states that most dragons were originally Imugis (이무기), or lesser dragons, which were said to resemble gigantic serpents
Dragon|dragon|There are a few different versions of Korean folklore that describe both what imugis are and how they aspire to become full-fledged dragons
Dragon|dragon|Koreans thought that an Imugi could become a true dragon, yong or mireu, if it caught a Yeouiju which had fallen from heaven
Dragon|dragon|Another explanation states they are hornless creatures resembling dragons who have been cursed and thus were unable to become dragons
Dragon|dragon|By other accounts, an Imugi is a proto-dragon which must survive one thousand years in order to become a fully fledged dragon
Dragon|dragon|In either case they are said to be large, benevolent, python-like creatures that live in water or caves, and their sighting is associated with good luck.
Dragon|dragon|Japanese dragon myths amalgamate native legends with imported stories about dragons from China
Dragon|dragon|Like those other Asian dragons, most Japanese ones are water deities associated with rainfall and bodies of water, and are typically depicted as large, wingless, serpentine creatures with clawed feet
Dragon|dragon|"Gould writes (1896:248), the Japanese dragon is ""invariably figured as possessing three claws"""
Dragon|dragon|A story about the samurai Minamoto no Mitsunaka tells that, while he was hunting in his own territory of Settsu, he fell asleep under a tree and had a dream in which a beautiful woman appeared to him and begged him to save her land from a giant serpent which was defiling it
Dragon|dragon|Mitsunaka agreed to help and the maiden gave him a magnificent horse
Dragon|dragon|When he woke up, the horse was standing before him
Dragon|dragon|He rode it to the Sumiyoshi temple, where he prayed for eight days
Dragon|dragon|Then he confronted the serpent and slew it with an arrow.It was believed that dragons could be appeased or exorcised with metal
Dragon|dragon|Nitta Yoshisada is said to have hurled a famous sword into the sea at Sagami to appease the dragon-god of the sea and Ki no Tsurayuki threw a metal mirror into the sea at Sumiyoshi for the same purpose
Dragon|dragon|Japanese Buddhism has also adapted dragons by subjecting them to Buddhist law; the Japanese Buddhist deities Benten and Kwannon are often shown sitting or standing on the back of a dragon
Dragon|dragon|"Several Japanese sennin (""immortals"") have taken dragons as their mounts"
Dragon|dragon|Bômô is said to have hurled his staff into a puddle of water, causing a dragon to come forth and let him ride it to heaven
Dragon|dragon|The rakan Handaka is said to have been able to conjure a dragon out of a bowl, which he is often shown playing with on kagamibuta
Dragon|dragon|The shachihoko is a creature with the head of a dragon, a bushy tail, fishlike scales, and sometimes fire emerging from its armpits
Dragon|dragon|The shifun has the head of a dragon, feathered wings, and the tail and claws of a bird
Dragon|dragon|"A white dragon was believed to reside in a pool in Yamashiro Province and, every fifty years, it would turn into a bird called the Ogonchô, which had a call like the ""howling of a wild dog"""
Dragon|dragon|This event was believed to herald terrible famine
Dragon|dragon|In the Japanese village of Okumura, near Edo, during times of drought, the villagers would make a dragon effigy out of straw, magnolia leaves, and bamboo and parade it through the village to attract rainfall.
Dragon|dragon|The Vietnamese dragon (Vietnamese
Dragon|dragon|rồng 龍) was a mythical creature that was often used as a deity symbol and associated with royalty
Dragon|dragon|Similar to other cultures, dragons in Vietnamese culture represent yang and godly being associated with creation and life.
Dragon|dragon|"Ancient peoples across the Near East believed in creatures similar to what modern people call ""dragons"""
Dragon|dragon|These ancient peoples were unaware of the existence of dinosaurs or similar creatures in the distant past
Dragon|dragon|References to dragons of both benevolent and malevolent characters occur throughout ancient Mesopotamian literature
Dragon|dragon|In Sumerian poetry, great kings are often compared to the ušumgal, a gigantic, serpentine monster

Dragon|dragon|2334 – 2154 BC) until the Neo-Babylonian Period (626 BC–539 BC)
Dragon|dragon|The dragon is usually shown with its mouth open
Dragon|dragon|"It may have been known as the (ūmu) nā’iru, which means ""roaring weather beast"", and may have been associated with the god Ishkur (Hadad)"
Dragon|dragon|A slightly different lion-dragon with two horns and the tail of a scorpion appears in art from the Neo-Assyrian Period (911 BC–609 BC)
Dragon|dragon|A relief probably commissioned by Sennacherib shows the gods Ashur, Sin, and Adad standing on its back.Another draconic creature with horns, the body and neck of a snake, the forelegs of a lion, and the hind-legs of a bird appears in Mesopotamian art from the Akkadian Period until the Hellenistic Period (323 BC–31 BC)
Dragon|dragon|"This creature, known in Akkadian as the mušḫuššu, meaning ""furious serpent"", was used as a symbol for particular deities and also as a general protective emblem"
Dragon|dragon|It seems to have originally been the attendant of the Underworld god Ninazu, but later became the attendant to the Hurrian storm-god Tishpak, as well as, later, Ninazu's son Ningishzida, the Babylonian national god Marduk, the scribal god Nabu, and the Assyrian national god Ashur.Scholars disagree regarding the appearance of Tiamat, the Babylonian goddess personifying primeval chaos slain by Marduk in the Babylonian creation epic Enûma Eliš
Dragon|dragon|"She was traditionally regarded by scholars as having had the form of a giant serpent, but several scholars have pointed out that this shape ""cannot be imputed to Tiamat with certainty"" and she seems to have at least sometimes been regarded as anthropomorphic"
Dragon|dragon|Nonetheless, in some texts, she seems to be described with horns, a tail, and a hide that no weapon can penetrate, all features which suggest she was conceived as some form of dragoness.
Dragon|dragon|"In the Ugaritic Baal Cycle, the sea-dragon Lōtanu is described as ""the twisting serpent/ the powerful one with seven heads."" In KTU 1.5 I 2–3, Lōtanu is slain by the storm-god Baal, but, in KTU 1.3 III 41–42, he is instead slain by the virgin warrior goddess Anat"
Dragon|dragon|In the Book of Psalms, Psalm 74, Psalm 74:13–14, the sea-dragon Leviathan, whose name is a cognate of Lōtanu, is slain by Yahweh, the national god of the kingdoms of Israel and Judah, as part of the creation of the world
Dragon|dragon|In Isaiah 27:1, Yahweh's destruction of Leviathan is foretold as part of Yahweh's impending overhaul of the universal order:
Dragon|dragon|Job 41:1–34 contains a detailed description of the Leviathan, who is described as being so powerful that only Yahweh can overcome it
Dragon|dragon|Job 41:19–21 states that the Leviathan exhales fire and smoke, making its identification as a mythical dragon clearly apparent
Dragon|dragon|In some parts of the Old Testament, the Leviathan is historicized as a symbol for the nations that stand against Yahweh
Dragon|dragon|"Rahab, a synonym for ""Leviathan"", is used in several Biblical passages in reference to Egypt"
Dragon|dragon|Isaiah 30:7 declares
Dragon|dragon|"""For Egypt's help is worthless and empty, therefore I have called her 'the silenced Rahab'."" Similarly, Psalm 87:3 reads"
Dragon|dragon|"""I reckon Rahab and Babylon as those that know me..."" In Ezekiel 29:3–5 and Ezekiel 32:2–8, the pharaoh of Egypt is described as a ""dragon"" (tannîn)"
Dragon|dragon|In the story of Bel and the Dragon from the apocryphal additions to Daniel, the prophet Daniel sees a dragon being worshipped by the Babylonians
Dragon|dragon|"Daniel makes ""cakes of pitch, fat, and hair""; the dragon eats them and bursts open."
Dragon|dragon|Azhi Dahaka (Avestan Great Snake) is a dragon or demonic figure in the texts and mythology of Zoroastrian Persia, where he is one of the subordinates of Angra Mainyu
Dragon|dragon|Alternate names include Azi Dahak, Dahaka, Dahak
Dragon|dragon|"Aži (nominative ažiš) is the Avestan word for ""serpent"" or ""dragon"
Dragon|dragon|"The Avestan term Aži Dahāka and the Middle Persian azdahāg are the source of the Middle Persian Manichaean demon of greed ""Az"", Old Armenian mythological figure Aždahak, Modern Persian 'aždehâ/aždahâ', Tajik Persian 'azhdahâ', Urdu 'azhdahā' (اژدها), as well as the Kurdish ejdîha (ئەژدیها)."
Dragon|dragon|Aži Dahāka is the most significant and long-lasting of the ažis of the Avesta, the earliest religious texts of Zoroastrianism
Dragon|dragon|He is described as a monster with three mouths, six eyes, and three heads, cunning, strong, and demonic
Dragon|dragon|In other respects Aži Dahāka has human qualities, and is never a mere animal
Dragon|dragon|In a post-Avestan Zoroastrian text, the Dēnkard, Aži Dahāka is possessed of all possible sins and evil counsels, the opposite of the good king Jam (or Jamshid)
Dragon|dragon|"The name Dahāg (Dahāka) is punningly interpreted as meaning ""having ten (dah) sins""."
Dragon|dragon|In Ferdowsi's Shahnameh, the Iranian hero Rostam must slay an 80-meter-long dragon (which renders itself invisible to human sight) with the aid of his legendary horse, Rakhsh
Dragon|dragon|As Rostam is sleeping, the dragon approaches; Rakhsh attempts to wake Rostam, but fails to alert him to the danger until Rostam sees the dragon
Dragon|dragon|Rakhsh bites the dragon, while Rostam decapitates it
Dragon|dragon|This is the third trial of Rostam's Seven Labors.Rostam is also credited with the slaughter of other dragons in the Shahnameh and in other Iranian oral traditions, notably in the myth of Babr-e-Bayan
Dragon|dragon|"In this tale, Rostam is still an adolescent and kills a dragon in the ""Orient"" (either India or China depending on the source) by forcing it to swallow either ox hides filled with quicklime and stones or poisoned blades"
Dragon|dragon|The dragon swallows these foreign objects and its stomach bursts, after which Rostam flays the dragon and fashions a coat from its hide called the babr-e bayān
Dragon|dragon|In some variants of the story, Rostam then remains unconscious for two days and nights, but is guarded by his steed Rakhsh
Dragon|dragon|On reviving, he washes himself in a spring
Dragon|dragon|In the Mandean tradition of the story, Rostam hides in a box, is swallowed by the dragon and kills it from inside its belly
Dragon|dragon|The king of China then gives Rostam his daughter in marriage as a reward.
Dragon|dragon|In the Rigveda, the oldest of the four Vedas, Indra, the Vedic god of storms, battles Vṛtra, a giant serpent who represents drought
Dragon|dragon|Indra kills Vṛtra using his vajra (thunderbolt) and clears the path for rain, which is described in the form of cattle
Dragon|dragon|"""You won the cows, hero, you won the Soma,/You freed the seven streams to flow"" (Rigveda 1.32.12)"
Dragon|dragon|In another Rigvedic legend, the three-headed serpent Viśvarūpa, the son of Tvaṣṭṛ, guards a wealth of cows and horses
Dragon|dragon|Indra delivers Viśvarūpa to a god named Trita Āptya, who fights and kills him and sets his cattle free
Dragon|dragon|Indra cuts off Viśvarūpa's heads and drives the cattle home for Trita
Dragon|dragon|This same story is alluded to in the Younger Avesta, in which the hero Thraētaona, the son of Āthbya, slays the three-headed dragon Aži Dahāka and takes his two beautiful wives as spoils
Dragon|dragon|"Thraētaona's name (meaning ""third grandson of the waters"") indicates that Aži Dahāka, like Vṛtra, was seen as a blocker of waters and cause of drought.The Druk (Dzongkha"
Dragon|dragon|འབྲུག་), also known as 'Thunder Dragon', is one of the National symbols of Bhutan
Dragon|dragon|"In the Dzongkha language, Bhutan is known as Druk Yul ""Land of Druk"", and Bhutanese leaders are called Druk Gyalpo, ""Thunder Dragon Kings"""
Dragon|dragon|The druk was adopted as an emblem by the Drukpa Lineage, which originated in Tibet and later spread to Bhutan.
Dragon|dragon|The story of a hero slaying a giant serpent occurs in nearly every Indo-European mythology
Dragon|dragon|In most stories, the hero is some kind of thunder-god
Dragon|dragon|"In nearly every iteration of the story, the serpent is either multi-headed or ""multiple"" in some other way"
Dragon|dragon|Furthermore, in nearly every story, the serpent is always somehow associated with water
Dragon|dragon|Bruce Lincoln has proposed that a Proto-Indo-European dragon-slaying myth can be reconstructed as follows
Dragon|dragon|"First, the sky gods give cattle to a man named *Tritos (""the third""), who is so named because he is the third man on earth, but a three-headed serpent named *Ngwhi steals them"
Dragon|dragon|"*Tritos pursues the serpent and is accompanied by *Hanér, whose name means ""man"""
Dragon|dragon|Together, the two heroes slay the serpent and rescue the cattle.
Dragon|dragon|"The ancient Greek word usually translated as ""dragon"" (δράκων drákōn, genitive δράκοντοϛ drákontos) could also mean ""snake"", but it usually refers to a kind of giant serpent that either possesses supernatural characteristics or is otherwise controlled by some supernatural power"
Dragon|dragon|"The first mention of a ""dragon"" in ancient Greek literature occurs in the Iliad, in which Agamemnon is described as having a blue dragon motif on his sword belt and an emblem of a three-headed dragon on his breast plate"
Dragon|dragon|In lines 820–880 of the Theogony, a Greek poem written in the seventh century BC by the Boeotian poet Hesiod, the Greek god Zeus battles the monster Typhon, who has one hundred serpent heads that breathe fire and make many frightening animal noises
Dragon|dragon|Zeus scorches all of Typhon's heads with his lightning bolts and then hurls Typhon into Tartarus
Dragon|dragon|In the Homeric Hymn to Apollo, the god Apollo uses his poisoned arrows to slay the serpent Python, who has been causing death and pestilence in the area around Delphi
Dragon|dragon|"Apollo then sets up his shrine there.The Roman poet Virgil in his poem Culex, lines 163–201 [1], describing a shepherd having a fight with a big constricting snake, calls it ""serpens"" and also ""draco"", showing that in his time the two words were probably interchangeable."
Dragon|dragon|Hesiod also mentions that the hero Heracles slew the Lernaean Hydra, a multiple-headed serpent which dwelt in the swamps of Lerna
Dragon|dragon|"The name ""Hydra"" means ""water snake"" in Greek"
Dragon|dragon|According to the Bibliotheka of Pseudo-Apollodorus, the slaying of the Hydra was the second of the Twelve Labors of Heracles
Dragon|dragon|Accounts disagree on which weapon Heracles used to slay the Hydra, but, by the end of the sixth century BC, it was agreed that the clubbed or severed heads needed to be cauterized to prevent them from growing back
Dragon|dragon|Heracles was aided in this task by his nephew Iolaus
Dragon|dragon|During the battle, a giant crab crawled out of the marsh and pinched Heracles's foot, but he crushed it under his heel
Dragon|dragon|Hera placed the crab in the sky as the constellation Cancer
Dragon|dragon|One of the Hydra's heads was immortal, so Heracles buried it under a heavy rock after cutting it off
Dragon|dragon|"For his Eleventh Labor, Heracles must procure a golden apple from the tree in the Garden of the Hesperides, which is guarded by an enormous serpent that never sleeps, which Pseudo-Apollodorus calls ""Ladon"""
Dragon|dragon|In earlier depictions, Ladon is often shown with many heads
Dragon|dragon|In Pseudo-Apollodorus's account, Ladon is immortal, but Sophocles and Euripides both describe Heracles as killing him, although neither of them specifies how
Dragon|dragon|The mythographer Herodorus is the first to state that Heracles slew him using his famous club
Dragon|dragon|"Apollonius of Rhodes, in his epic poem the Argonautica, describes Ladon as having been shot full of poisoned arrows dipped in the blood of the Hydra.In Pindar's Fourth Pythian Ode, Aeëtes of Colchis tells the hero Jason that the Golden Fleece he is seeking is in a copse guarded by a dragon, ""which surpassed in breadth and length a fifty-oared ship"""
Dragon|dragon|Jason slays the dragon and makes off with the Golden Fleece together with his co-conspirator, Aeëtes's daughter, Medea
Dragon|dragon|The earliest artistic representation of this story is an Attic red-figure kylix dated to c
Dragon|dragon|480–470 BC, showing a bedraggled Jason being disgorged from the dragon's open mouth as the Golden Fleece hangs in a tree behind him and Athena, the goddess of wisdom, stands watching
Dragon|dragon|A fragment from Pherecydes of Athens states that Jason killed the dragon, but fragments from the Naupactica and from Herodorus state that he merely stole the Fleece and escaped
Dragon|dragon|In Euripides's Medea, Medea boasts that she killed the Colchian dragon herself
Dragon|dragon|In the most famous retelling of the story from Apollonius of Rhodes's Argonautica, Medea drugs the dragon to sleep, allowing Jason to steal the Fleece
Dragon|dragon|Greek vase paintings show her feeding the dragon the sleeping drug in a liquid form from a phialē, or shallow cup.
Dragon|dragon|In the founding myth of Thebes, Cadmus, a Phoenician prince, was instructed by Apollo to follow a heifer and found a city wherever it laid down
Dragon|dragon|Cadmus and his men followed the heifer and, when it laid down, Cadmus ordered his men to find a spring so he could sacrifice the heifer to Athena
Dragon|dragon|His men found a spring, but it was guarded by a dragon, which had been placed there by the god Ares, and the dragon killed them
Dragon|dragon|Cadmus killed the dragon in revenge, either by smashing its head with a rock or using his sword
Dragon|dragon|Following the advice of Athena, Cadmus tore out the dragon's teeth and planted them in the earth
Dragon|dragon|"An army of giant warriors (known as spartoi, which means ""sown men"") grew from the teeth like plants"
Dragon|dragon|Cadmus hurled stones into their midst, causing them to kill each other until only five were left
Dragon|dragon|To make restitution for having killed Ares's dragon, Cadmus was forced to serve Ares as a slave for eight years
Dragon|dragon|At the end of this period, Cadmus married Harmonia, the daughter of Ares and Aphrodite
Dragon|dragon|Cadmus and Harmonia moved to Illyria, where they ruled as king and queen, before eventually being transformed into dragons themselves.In the fifth century BC, the Greek historian Herodotus reported in Book IV of his Histories that western Libya was inhabited by monstrous serpents and, in Book III, he states that Arabia was home to many small, winged serpents, which came in a variety of colors and enjoyed the trees that produced frankincense
Dragon|dragon|Herodotus remarks that the serpent's wings were like those of bats and that, unlike vipers, which are found in every land, winged serpents are only found in Arabia
Dragon|dragon|The second-century BC Greek astronomer Hipparchus (c

Dragon|dragon|In the New Testament, Revelation 12:3, written by John of Patmos, describes a vision of a Great Red Dragon with seven heads, ten horns, seven crowns, and a massive tail, an image which is clearly inspired by the vision of the four beasts from the sea in the Book of Daniel and the Leviathan described in various Old Testament passages
Dragon|dragon|"The Great Red Dragon knocks ""a third of the sun .."

Dragon|dragon|In the Old Norse poem Grímnismál in the Poetic Edda, the dragon Níðhöggr is described as gnawing on the roots of Yggdrasil, the world tree
Dragon|dragon|In Norse mythology, Jörmungandr is a giant serpent that encircles the entire realm of Miðgarð in the sea around it
Dragon|dragon|According to the Gylfaginning from the Prose Edda, written by the thirteenth-century Icelandic mythographer Snorri Sturluson, Thor, the Norse god of thunder, once went out on a boat with the giant Hymnir to the outer sea and fished for Jörmungandr using an ox-head as bait
Dragon|dragon|Thor caught the serpent and, after pulling its head out of the water, smashed it with his hammer Mjölnir
Dragon|dragon|Snorri states that the blow was not fatal

Dragon|dragon|The eponymous hero of the poem insists on confronting the dragon alone, even though he is of advanced age, but Wiglaf, the youngest of the twelve warriors Beowulf has brought with him, insists on accompanying his king into the battle
Dragon|dragon|Beowulf's sword shatters during the fight and he is mortally wounded, but Wiglaf comes to his rescue and helps him slay the dragon
Dragon|dragon|Beowulf dies and tells Wiglaf that the dragon's treasure must be buried rather than shared with the cowardly warriors who did not come to the aid of their king.In the Old Norse Völsunga saga, the hero Sigurd catches the dragon Fafnir by digging a pit between the cave where he lives and the spring where he drinks his water and kills him by stabbing him in the underside
Dragon|dragon|At the advice of Odin, Sigurd drains Fafnir's blood and drinks it, which gives him the ability to understand the language of the birds, who he hears talking about how his mentor Regin is plotting to betray him so that he can keep all of Fafnir's treasure for himself
Dragon|dragon|The motif of a hero trying to sneak past a sleeping dragon and steal some of its treasure is common throughout many Old Norse sagas
Dragon|dragon|The fourteenth-century Flóres saga konungs ok sona hans describes a hero who is actively concerned not to wake a sleeping dragon while sneaking past it
Dragon|dragon|In the Yngvars saga víðförla, the protagonist attempts to steal treasure from several sleeping dragons, but accidentally wakes them up.
Dragon|dragon|The modern, western image of a dragon developed in western Europe during the Middle Ages through the combination of the snakelike dragons of classical Graeco-Roman literature, references to Near Eastern European dragons preserved in the Bible, and western European folk traditions
Dragon|dragon|The period between the eleventh and thirteenth centuries represents the height of European interest in dragons as living creatures
Dragon|dragon|The twelfth-century Welsh monk Geoffrey of Monmouth recounts a famous legend in his Historia Regum Britanniae in which the child prophet Merlin witnesses the Romano-Celtic warlord Vortigern attempt to build a tower on Mount Snowdon to keep safe from the Anglo-Saxons, but the tower keeps being swallowed into the ground
Dragon|dragon|Merlin informs Vortigern that, underneath the foundation he has built, is a pool with two dragons sleeping in it
Dragon|dragon|Vortigern orders for the pool to be drained, exposing a red dragon and a white dragon, who immediately begin fighting
Dragon|dragon|Merlin delivers a prophecy that the white dragon will triumph over the red, symbolizing England's conquest of Wales, but declares that the red dragon will eventually return and defeat the white one
Dragon|dragon|This story remained popular throughout the fifteenth century.
Dragon|dragon|The oldest recognizable image of a fully modern, western dragon appears in a hand-painted illustration from the medieval manuscript MS Harley 3244, which was produced in around 1260 AD
Dragon|dragon|The dragon in the illustration has two sets of wings and its tail is longer than most modern depictions of dragons, but it clearly displays many of the same distinctive features
Dragon|dragon|Dragons are generally depicted as living in rivers or having an underground lair or cave
Dragon|dragon|They are envisioned as greedy and gluttonous, with voracious appetites
Dragon|dragon|"They are often identified with Satan, due to the references to Satan as a ""dragon"" in the Book of Revelation"
Dragon|dragon|The thirteenth-century Golden Legend, written in Latin, records the story of Saint Margaret of Antioch, a virgin martyr who, after being tortured for her faith in the Diocletianic Persecution and thrown back into her cell, is said to have been confronted by a monstrous dragon, but she made the sign of the cross and the dragon vanished
Dragon|dragon|In some versions of the story, she is actually swallowed by the dragon alive and, after making the sign of the cross in the dragon's stomach, emerges unharmed.
Dragon|dragon|The legend of Saint George and the Dragon may be referenced as early as the sixth century AD, but the earliest artistic representations of it come from the eleventh century and the first full account of it comes from an eleventh-century Georgian text
Dragon|dragon|The most famous version of the story from the Golden Legend holds that a dragon kept pillaging the sheep of the town of Silene in Libya
Dragon|dragon|After it ate a young shepherd, the people were forced to placate it by leaving two sheep as sacrificial offerings every morning beside the lake where the dragon lived
Dragon|dragon|Eventually, the dragon ate all of the sheep and the people were forced to start offering it their own children
Dragon|dragon|One day, the king's own daughter came up in the lottery and, despite the king's pleas for her life, she was dressed as a bride and chained to a rock beside the lake to be eaten
Dragon|dragon|Then, Saint George arrived and saw the princess
Dragon|dragon|When the dragon arrived to eat her, he stabbed it with his lance and subdued it by making the sign of the cross and tying the princess's girdle around its neck
Dragon|dragon|Saint George and the princess led the now-docile dragon into the town and George promised to kill it if the townspeople would convert to Christianity
Dragon|dragon|All the townspeople converted and Saint George killed the dragon with his sword
Dragon|dragon|In some versions, Saint George marries the princess, but, in others, he continues wandering.Gargoyles are carved stone figures sometimes resembling dragons that originally served as waterspouts on buildings
Dragon|dragon|Precursors to the medieval gargoyle can be found on ancient Greek and Egyptian temples, but, over the course of the Middle Ages, many fantastic stories were invented to explain them
Dragon|dragon|One medieval French legend holds that, in ancient times, a fearsome dragon known as La Gargouille had been causing floods and sinking ships on the river Seine, so the people of the town of Rouen would offer the dragon a human sacrifice once each year to appease its hunger
Dragon|dragon|Then, in around 600 AD, a priest named Romanus promised that, if the people would build a church, he would rid them of the dragon
Dragon|dragon|Romanus slew the dragon and its severed head was mounted on the walls of the city as the first gargoyle.Dragons are prominent in medieval heraldry
Dragon|dragon|Uther Pendragon was famously said to have had two gold dragons crowned with red standing back-to-back on his royal coat of arms
Dragon|dragon|"Originally, heraldic dragons could have any number of legs, but, by the late Middle Ages, due to the widespread proliferation of bestiaries, heraldry began to distinguish between a ""dragon"" (which could only have exactly four legs) and a ""wyvern"" (which could only have exactly two)"
Dragon|dragon|In myths, wyverns are associated with viciousness, envy, and pestilence, but, in heraldry, they are used as symbols for overthrowing the tyranny of Satan and his demonic forces
Dragon|dragon|"Late medieval heraldry also distinguished a draconic creature known as a ""cockatrice"""
Dragon|dragon|A cockatrice is supposedly born when a serpent hatches an egg that has been laid on a dunghill by a rooster and it is so venomous that its breath and its gaze are both lethal to any living creature, except for a weasel, which is the cockatrice's mortal enemy
Dragon|dragon|A basilisk is a serpent with the head of a dragon at the end of its tail that is born when a toad hatches an egg that has been laid in a midden by a nine-year-old cockatrice
Dragon|dragon|Like the cockatrice, its glare is said to be deadly.
Dragon|dragon|In Albanian mythology and folklore, stihi, ljubi, bolla, bollar, errshaja and kulshedra are mythological figures described as serpentine dragons
Dragon|dragon|It is believed that bolla, a water and chthonic demonic serpent, undergoes metamorphosis passing through four distinct phases if it lives many years without being seen by a human
Dragon|dragon|The bollar and errshaja are the intermediate stages, while the kulshedra is the ultimate phase, described as a huge multi-headed fire-spitting female serpent which causes drought, storms, flooding, earthquakes and other natural disasters against mankind
Dragon|dragon|She is usually fought and defeated by a drangue, a semi-human winged divine hero and protector of humans
Dragon|dragon|"Heavy thunderstorms are thought to be the result of their battles.In Slavic mythology, the words ""zmey"", ""zmiy"" or ""zmaj"" are used to describe dragons"
Dragon|dragon|"These words are masculine forms of the Slavic word for ""snake"", which are normally feminine (like Russian zmeya)"
Dragon|dragon|In Romania, there is a similar figure, derived from the Slavic dragon and named zmeu
Dragon|dragon|Exclusively in Polish and Belarusian folklore, as well as in the other Slavic folklores, a dragon is also called (variously) смок, цмок, or smok
Dragon|dragon|In South Slavic folklores, the same thing is also called lamya (ламя, ламjа, lamja)
Dragon|dragon|Although quite similar to other European dragons, Slavic dragons have their peculiarities.
Dragon|dragon|In Russian and Ukrainian folklore, Zmey Gorynych is a dragon with three heads, each one bearing twin goatlike horns
Dragon|dragon|He is said to have breathed fire and smelled of sulfur
Dragon|dragon|It was believed that eclipses were caused by Gorynych temporarily swallowing the sun
Dragon|dragon|According to one legend, Gorynych's uncle was the evil sorcerer Nemal Chelovek, who abducted the daughter of the tsar and imprisoned her in his castle in the Ural Mountains
Dragon|dragon|Many knights tried to free her, but all of them were killed by Gorynych's fire
Dragon|dragon|Then a palace guard in Moscow named Ivan Tsarevich overheard two crows talking about the princess
Dragon|dragon|He went to the tsar, who gave him a magic sword, and snuck into the castle
Dragon|dragon|When Chelovek attacked Ivan in the form of a giant, the sword flew from Ivan's hand unbidden and killed him
Dragon|dragon|Then the sword cut off all three of Gorynych's heads at once
Dragon|dragon|Ivan brought the princess back to the tsar, who declared Ivan a nobleman and allowed him to marry the princess.A popular Polish folk tale is the legend of the Wawel Dragon, which is first recorded in the Chronica Polonorum of Wincenty Kadłubek, written between 1190 and 1208
Dragon|dragon|According to Kadłubek, the dragon appeared during the reign of King Krakus and demanded to be fed a fixed number of cattle every week
Dragon|dragon|If the villagers failed to provide enough cattle, the dragon would eat the same number of villagers as the number of cattle they had failed to provide
Dragon|dragon|Krakus ordered his sons to slay the dragon
Dragon|dragon|Since they could not slay it by hand, they tricked the dragon into eating calfskins filled with burning sulfur
Dragon|dragon|Once the dragon was dead, the younger brother attacked and murdered his older brother and returned home to claim all the glory for himself, telling his father that his brother had died fighting the dragon
Dragon|dragon|The younger brother became king after his father died, but his secret was eventually revealed and he was banished
Dragon|dragon|In the fifteenth century, Jan Długosz rewrote the story so that King Krakus himself was the one who slew the dragon
Dragon|dragon|Another version of the story told by Marcin Bielski instead has the clever shoemaker Skuba come up with the idea for slaying the dragon
Dragon|dragon|Bielski's version is now the most popular.
Dragon|dragon|Dragons and dragon motifs are featured in many works of modern literature, particularly within the fantasy genre
Dragon|dragon|As early as the eighteenth century, critical thinkers such as Denis Diderot were already asserting that too much literature had been published on dragons
Dragon|dragon|"""There are already in books all too many fabulous stories of dragons"""
Dragon|dragon|In Lewis Carroll's classic children's novel Through the Looking-Glass (1872), one of the inset poems describes the Jabberwock, a kind of dragon
Dragon|dragon|Carroll's illustrator John Tenniel, a famous political cartoonist, humorously showed the Jabberwock with the waistcoat, buck teeth, and myopic eyes of a Victorian university lecturer, such as Carroll himself
Dragon|dragon|In works of comedic children's fantasy, dragons often fulfill the role of a magic fairy tale helper
Dragon|dragon|In such works, rather than being frightening as they are traditionally portrayed, dragons are instead represented as harmless, benevolent, and inferior to humans
Dragon|dragon|They are sometimes shown living in contact with humans, or in isolated communities of only dragons
Dragon|dragon|"Though popular in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, ""such comic and idyllic stories"" began to grow increasingly rare after the 1960s, due to demand for more serious children's literature.One of the most iconic modern dragons is Smaug from J"

Snake|snake|Lizards have evolved elongate bodies without limbs or with greatly reduced limbs about twenty-five times independently via convergent evolution, leading to many lineages of legless lizards
Snake|snake|These resemble snakes, but several common groups of legless lizards have eyelids and external ears, which snakes lack, although this rule is not universal (see Amphisbaenia, Dibamidae, and Pygopodidae).
Snake|snake|Living snakes are found on every continent except Antarctica, and on most smaller land masses; exceptions include some large islands, such as Ireland, Iceland, Greenland, the Hawaiian archipelago, and the islands of New Zealand, as well as many small islands of the Atlantic and central Pacific oceans
Snake|snake|Additionally, sea snakes are widespread throughout the Indian and Pacific oceans
Snake|snake|More than twenty families are currently recognized, comprising about 520 genera and about 3,900 species
Snake|snake|They range in size from the tiny, 10.4 cm-long (4.1 in) Barbados threadsnake to the reticulated python of 6.95 meters (22.8 ft) in length
Snake|snake|The fossil species Titanoboa cerrejonensis was 12.8 meters (42 ft) long
Snake|snake|Snakes are thought to have evolved from either burrowing or aquatic lizards, perhaps during the Jurassic period, with the earliest known fossils dating to between 143 and 167 Ma ago
Snake|snake|The diversity of modern snakes appeared during the Paleocene epoch (c
Snake|snake|66 to 56 Ma ago, after the Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event)
Snake|snake|The oldest preserved descriptions of snakes can be found in the Brooklyn Papyrus.
Snake|snake|Most species of snake are nonvenomous and those that have venom use it primarily to kill and subdue prey rather than for self-defense
Snake|snake|Some possess venom that is potent enough to cause painful injury or death to humans
Snake|snake|Nonvenomous snakes either swallow prey alive or kill by constriction.
Snake|snake|The English word snake comes from Old English snaca, itself from Proto-Germanic *snak-an- (cf
Snake|snake|Germanic Schnake 'ring snake', Swedish snok 'grass snake'), from Proto-Indo-European root *(s)nēg-o- 'to crawl to creep', which also gave sneak as well as Sanskrit nāgá 'snake'
Snake|snake|The word ousted adder, as adder went on to narrow in meaning, though in Old English næddre was the general word for snake
Snake|snake|The other term, serpent, is from French, ultimately from Indo-European *serp- 'to creep', which also gave Ancient Greek ἕρπω (hérpō) 'I crawl'.
Snake|snake|The fossil record of snakes is relatively poor because snake skeletons are typically small and fragile making fossilization uncommon
Snake|snake|Fossils readily identifiable as snakes (though often retaining hind limbs) first appear in the fossil record during the Cretaceous period
Snake|snake|The earliest known true snake fossils (members of the crown group Serpentes) come from the marine simoliophiids, the oldest of which is the Late Cretaceous (Cenomanian age) Haasiophis terrasanctus, dated to between 112 and 94 million years old.Based on comparative anatomy, there is consensus that snakes descended from lizards.
Snake|snake|11  Pythons and boas—primitive groups among modern snakes—have vestigial hind limbs
Snake|snake|tiny, clawed digits known as anal spurs, which are used to grasp during mating.
Snake|snake|11  The families Leptotyphlopidae and Typhlopidae also possess remnants of the pelvic girdle, appearing as horny projections when visible.
Snake|snake|Front limbs are nonexistent in all known snakes
Snake|snake|This is caused by the evolution of their Hox genes, controlling limb morphogenesis
Snake|snake|The axial skeleton of the snakes’ common ancestor, like most other tetrapods, had regional specializations consisting of cervical (neck), thoracic (chest), lumbar (lower back), sacral (pelvic), and caudal (tail) vertebrae
Snake|snake|Early in snake evolution, the Hox gene expression in the axial skeleton responsible for the development of the thorax became dominant
Snake|snake|As a result, the vertebrae anterior to the hindlimb buds (when present) all have the same thoracic-like identity (except from the atlas, axis, and 1–3 neck vertebrae)
Snake|snake|In other words, most of a snake's skeleton is an extremely extended thorax
Snake|snake|Ribs are found exclusively on the thoracic vertebrae
Snake|snake|Neck, lumbar and pelvic vertebrae are very reduced in number (only 2–10 lumbar and pelvic vertebrae are present), while only a short tail remains of the caudal vertebrae
Snake|snake|However, the tail is still long enough to be of important use in many species, and is modified in some aquatic and tree-dwelling species.
Snake|snake|Many modern snake groups originated during the Paleocene, alongside the adaptive radiation of mammals following the extinction of (non-avian) dinosaurs
Snake|snake|The expansion of grasslands in North America also led to an explosive radiation among snakes
Snake|snake|Previously, snakes were a minor component of the North American fauna, but during the Miocene, the number of species and their prevalence increased dramatically with the first appearances of vipers and elapids in North America and the significant diversification of Colubridae (including the origin of many modern genera such as Nerodia, Lampropeltis, Pituophis, and Pantherophis).
Snake|snake|There is fossil evidence to suggest that snakes may have evolved from burrowing lizards, during the Cretaceous Period
Snake|snake|An early fossil snake relative, Najash rionegrina, was a two-legged burrowing animal with a sacrum, and was fully terrestrial
Snake|snake|One extant analog of these putative ancestors is the earless monitor Lanthanotus of Borneo (though it also is semiaquatic)
Snake|snake|Subterranean species evolved bodies streamlined for burrowing, and eventually lost their limbs
Snake|snake|According to this hypothesis, features such as the transparent, fused eyelids (brille) and loss of external ears evolved to cope with fossorial difficulties, such as scratched corneas and dirt in the ears
Snake|snake|Some primitive snakes are known to have possessed hindlimbs, but their pelvic bones lacked a direct connection to the vertebrae
Snake|snake|These include fossil species like Haasiophis, Pachyrhachis and Eupodophis, which are slightly older than Najash.This hypothesis was strengthened in 2015 by the discovery of a 113-million-year-old fossil of a four-legged snake in Brazil that has been named Tetrapodophis amplectus
Snake|snake|It has many snake-like features, is adapted for burrowing and its stomach indicates that it was preying on other animals
Snake|snake|It is currently uncertain if Tetrapodophis is a snake or another species, in the squamate order, as a snake-like body has independently evolved at least 26 times
Snake|snake|Tetrapodophis does not have distinctive snake features in its spine and skull
Snake|snake|A study in 2021 places the animal in a group of extinct marine lizards from the Cretaceous period known as dolichosaurs and not directly related to snakes.An alternative hypothesis, based on morphology, suggests the ancestors of snakes were related to mosasaurs—extinct aquatic reptiles from the Cretaceous—forming the clade Pythonomorpha
Snake|snake|According to this hypothesis, the fused, transparent eyelids of snakes are thought to have evolved to combat marine conditions (corneal water loss through osmosis), and the external ears were lost through disuse in an aquatic environment
Snake|snake|This ultimately led to an animal similar to today's sea snakes
Snake|snake|In the Late Cretaceous, snakes recolonized land, and continued to diversify into today's snakes
Snake|snake|Fossilized snake remains are known from early Late Cretaceous marine sediments, which is consistent with this hypothesis; particularly so, as they are older than the terrestrial Najash rionegrina
Snake|snake|Similar skull structure, reduced or absent limbs, and other anatomical features found in both mosasaurs and snakes lead to a positive cladistical correlation, although some of these features are shared with varanids.
Snake|snake|Genetic studies in recent years have indicated snakes are not as closely related to monitor lizards as was once believed—and therefore not to mosasaurs, the proposed ancestor in the aquatic scenario of their evolution
Snake|snake|However, more evidence links mosasaurs to snakes than to varanids
Snake|snake|Fragmented remains found from the Jurassic and Early Cretaceous indicate deeper fossil records for these groups, which may potentially refute either hypothesis.In 2016, two studies reported that limb loss in snakes is associated with DNA mutations in the Zone of Polarizing Activity Regulatory Sequence (ZRS), a regulatory region of the sonic hedgehog gene which is critically required for limb development
Snake|snake|More advanced snakes have no remnants of limbs, but basal snakes such as pythons and boas do have traces of highly reduced, vestigial hind limbs
Snake|snake|Python embryos even have fully developed hind limb buds, but their later development is stopped by the DNA mutations in the ZRS.
Snake|snake|There are about 3,900 species of snakes, ranging as far northward as the Arctic Circle in Scandinavia and southward through Australia
Snake|snake|Snakes can be found on every continent except Antarctica, as well as in the sea, and as high as 16,000 feet (4,900 m) in the Himalayan Mountains of Asia.
Snake|snake|143  There are numerous islands from which snakes are absent, such as Ireland, Iceland, and New Zealand (although New Zealand's waters are infrequently visited by the yellow-bellied sea snake and the banded sea krait).
Snake|snake|All modern snakes are grouped within the suborder Serpentes in Linnean taxonomy, part of the order Squamata, though their precise placement within squamates remains controversial.The two infraorders of Serpentes are
Snake|snake|Alethinophidia and Scolecophidia
Snake|snake|This separation is based on morphological characteristics and mitochondrial DNA sequence similarity
Snake|snake|"Alethinophidia is sometimes split into Henophidia and Caenophidia, with the latter consisting of ""colubroid"" snakes (colubrids, vipers, elapids, hydrophiids, and atractaspids) and acrochordids, while the other alethinophidian families comprise Henophidia"
Snake|snake|While not extant today, the Madtsoiidae, a family of giant, primitive, python-like snakes, was around until 50,000 years ago in Australia, represented by genera such as Wonambi.
Snake|snake|There are numerous debates in the systematics within the group
Snake|snake|For instance, many sources classify Boidae and Pythonidae as one family, while some keep the Elapidae and Hydrophiidae (sea snakes) separate for practical reasons despite their extremely close relation.
Snake|snake|While snakes are limbless reptiles, evolved from (and grouped with) lizards, there are many other species of lizards that have lost their limbs independently but which superficially look similar to snakes
Snake|snake|These include the slowworm and glass snake.
Snake|snake|The now extinct Titanoboa cerrejonensis was 12.8 m (42 ft) in length
Snake|snake|By comparison, the largest extant snakes are the reticulated python, measuring about 6.95 m (22.8 ft) long, and the green anaconda, which measures about 5.21 m (17.1 ft) long and is considered the heaviest snake on Earth at 97.5 kg (215 lb).At the other end of the scale, the smallest extant snake is Leptotyphlops carlae, with a length of about 10.4 cm (4.1 in)
Snake|snake|Most snakes are fairly small animals, approximately 1 m (3.3 ft) in length.
Snake|snake|"Pit vipers, pythons, and some boas have infrared-sensitive receptors in deep grooves on the snout, allowing them to ""see"" the radiated heat of warm-blooded prey"
Snake|snake|"In pit vipers, the grooves are located between the nostril and the eye in a large ""pit"" on each side of the head"
Snake|snake|Other infrared-sensitive snakes have multiple, smaller labial pits lining the upper lip, just below the nostrils.A snake tracks its prey using smell, collecting airborne particles with its forked tongue, then passing them to the vomeronasal organ or Jacobson's organ in the mouth for examination
Snake|snake|The fork in the tongue provides a sort of directional sense of smell and taste simultaneously
Snake|snake|The snake's tongue is constantly in motion, sampling particles from the air, ground, and water, analyzing the chemicals found, and determining the presence of prey or predators in the local environment
Snake|snake|In water-dwelling snakes, such as the anaconda, the tongue functions efficiently underwater.
Snake|snake|The underside of a snake is very sensitive to vibration, allowing the snake to detect approaching animals by sensing faint vibrations in the ground.Snake vision varies greatly between species
Snake|snake|Some have keen eyesight and others are only able to distinguish light from dark, but the important trend is that a snake's visual perception is adequate enough to track movements
Snake|snake|Generally, vision is best in tree-dwelling snakes and weakest in burrowing snakes
Snake|snake|Some have binocular vision, where both eyes are capable of focusing on the same point, an example of this being the Asian vine snake
Snake|snake|Most snakes focus by moving the lens back and forth in relation to the retina
Snake|snake|Diurnal snakes have round pupils and many nocturnal snakes have slit pupils
Snake|snake|Most species possess three visual pigments and are probably able to see two primary colors in daylight
Snake|snake|It has been concluded that the last common ancestors of all snakes had UV-sensitive vision, but most snakes that depend on their eyesight to hunt in daylight have evolved lenses that act like sunglasses for filtering out the UV-light, which probably also sharpens their vision by improving the contrast.
Snake|snake|The skin of a snake is covered in scales
Snake|snake|Contrary to the popular notion of snakes being slimy (because of possible confusion of snakes with worms), snakeskin has a smooth, dry texture
Snake|snake|Most snakes use specialized belly scales to travel, allowing them to grip surfaces
Snake|snake|The body scales may be smooth, keeled, or granular
Snake|snake|"The eyelids of a snake are transparent ""spectacle"" scales, also known as brille, which remain permanently closed."
Snake|snake|The shedding of scales is called ecdysis (or in normal usage, molting or sloughing)
Snake|snake|Snakes shed the complete outer layer of skin in one piece
Snake|snake|Snake scales are not discrete, but extensions of the epidermis—hence they are not shed separately but as a complete outer layer during each molt, akin to a sock being turned inside out.Snakes have a wide diversity of skin coloration patterns which are often related to behavior, such as the tendency to have to flee from predators
Snake|snake|Snakes that are at a high risk of predation tend to be plain, or have longitudinal stripes, providing few reference points to predators, thus allowing the snake to escape without being noticed
Snake|snake|Plain snakes usually adopt active hunting strategies, as their pattern allows them to send little information to prey about motion
Snake|snake|Blotched snakes usually use ambush-based strategies, likely because it helps them blend into an environment with irregularly shaped objects, like sticks or rocks
Snake|snake|Spotted patterning can similarly help snakes to blend into their environment.The shape and number of scales on the head, back, and belly are often characteristic and used for taxonomic purposes
Snake|snake|Scales are named mainly according to their positions on the body
Snake|snake|"In ""advanced"" (Caenophidian) snakes, the broad belly scales and rows of dorsal scales correspond to the vertebrae, allowing these to be counted without the need for dissection."
Snake|snake|"Molting (or ""ecdysis"") serves a number of purposes"
Snake|snake|Firstly, the old and worn skin is replaced, and secondly, it helps get rid of parasites such as mites and ticks
Snake|snake|Renewal of the skin by molting supposedly allows growth in some animals such as insects, but this has been disputed in the case of snakes.Molting occurs periodically throughout the life of a snake
Snake|snake|Before each molt, the snake stops eating and often hides or moves to a safe place
Snake|snake|Just before shedding, the skin becomes dull and dry looking and the snake's eyes turn cloudy or blue-colored
Snake|snake|The inner surface of the old skin liquefies, causing it to separate from the new skin beneath it
Snake|snake|"After a few days, the eyes become clear and the snake ""crawls"" out of its old skin, which splits close to the snake's mouth"
Snake|snake|The snake rubs its body against rough surfaces to aid in the shedding of its old skin
Snake|snake|In many cases, the cast skin peels backward over the body from head to tail in one piece, like pulling a sock off inside-out, revealing a new, larger, brighter layer of skin which has formed underneath.A young snake that is still growing may shed its skin up to four times a year, but an older snake may shed only once or twice a year
Snake|snake|The discarded skin carries a perfect imprint of the scale pattern, so it is usually possible to identify the snake from the cast skin if it is reasonably intact
Snake|snake|This periodic renewal has led to the snake being a symbol of healing and medicine, as pictured in the Rod of Asclepius.Scale counts can sometimes be used to identify the sex of a snake when the species is not distinctly sexually dimorphic
Snake|snake|A probe is fully inserted into the cloaca, marked at the point where it stops, then removed and measured against the subcaudal scales
Snake|snake|The scalation count determines whether the snake is a male or female, as the hemipenes of a male will probe to a different depth (usually longer) than the cloaca of a female.
Snake|snake|The skull consists of a solid and complete neurocranium, to which many of the other bones are only loosely attached, particularly the highly mobile jaw bones, which facilitate manipulation and ingestion of large prey items
Snake|snake|The left and right sides of the lower jaw are joined together only by a flexible ligament at the anterior tips, allowing them to separate widely, and the posterior end of the lower jaw bones articulate with a quadrate bone, allowing further mobility
Snake|snake|The mandible and quadrate bones can pick up ground-borne vibrations; because the sides of the lower jaw can move independently of one another, a snake resting its jaw on a surface has sensitive stereo auditory perception, used for detecting the position of prey
Snake|snake|The jaw–quadrate–stapes pathway is capable of detecting vibrations on the angstrom scale, despite the absence of an outer ear and the lack of an impedance matching mechanism—provided by the ossicles in other vertebrates—for receiving vibrations from the air.The hyoid is a small bone located posterior and ventral to the skull, in the 'neck' region, which serves as an attachment for the muscles of the snake's tongue, as it does in all other tetrapods.
Snake|snake|The vertebral column consists of between 200 and 400 vertebrae, or sometimes more
Snake|snake|The body vertebrae each have two ribs articulating with them
Snake|snake|The tail vertebrae are comparatively few in number (often less than 20% of the total) and lack ribs
Snake|snake|The vertebrae have projections that allow for strong muscle attachment, enabling locomotion without limbs.
Snake|snake|Caudal autotomy (self-amputation of the tail), a feature found in some lizards, is absent in most snakes
Snake|snake|In the rare cases where it does exist in snakes, caudal autotomy is intervertebral (meaning the separation of adjacent vertebrae), unlike that in lizards, which is intravertebral, i.e
Snake|snake|the break happens along a predefined fracture plane present on a vertebra.In some snakes, most notably boas and pythons, there are vestiges of the hindlimbs in the form of a pair of pelvic spurs
Snake|snake|These small, claw-like protrusions on each side of the cloaca are the external portion of the vestigial hindlimb skeleton, which includes the remains of an ilium and femur.
Snake|snake|Snakes and other reptiles have a three-chambered heart that controls the circulatory system via the left and right atrium, and one ventricle
Snake|snake|Internally, the ventricle is divided into three interconnected cavities
Snake|snake|the cavum arteriosum, the cavum pulmonale, and the cavum venosum
Snake|snake|The cavum venosum receives deoxygenated blood from the right atrium and the cavum arteriosum receives oxygenated blood from the left atrium
Snake|snake|Located beneath the cavum venosum is the cavum pulmonale, which pumps blood to the pulmonary trunk.The snake's heart is encased in a sac, called the pericardium, located at the bifurcation of the bronchi
Snake|snake|The heart is able to move around, owing to the lack of a diaphragm; this adjustment protects the heart from potential damage when large ingested prey is passed through the esophagus
Snake|snake|The spleen is attached to the gall bladder and pancreas and filters the blood
Snake|snake|The thymus, located in fatty tissue above the heart, is responsible for the generation of immune cells in the blood
Snake|snake|The cardiovascular system of snakes is unique for the presence of a renal portal system in which the blood from the snake's tail passes through the kidneys before returning to the heart.The vestigial left lung is often small or sometimes even absent, as snakes' tubular bodies require all of their organs to be long and thin
Snake|snake|In the majority of species, only one lung is functional
Snake|snake|This lung contains a vascularized anterior portion and a posterior portion that does not function in gas exchange
Snake|snake|This 'saccular lung' is used for hydrostatic purposes to adjust buoyancy in some aquatic snakes and its function remains unknown in terrestrial species
Snake|snake|Many organs that are paired, such as kidneys or reproductive organs, are staggered within the body, one located ahead of the other.Snakes have no lymph nodes.
Snake|snake|Cobras, vipers, and closely related species use venom to immobilize, injure, or kill their prey
Snake|snake|The venom is modified saliva, delivered through fangs.
Snake|snake|243  The fangs of 'advanced' venomous snakes like viperids and elapids are hollow, allowing venom to be injected more effectively, and the fangs of rear-fanged snakes such as the boomslang simply have a groove on the posterior edge to channel venom into the wound
Snake|snake|Snake venoms are often prey-specific, and their role in self-defense is secondary.
Snake|snake|243 Venom, like all salivary secretions, is a predigestant that initiates the breakdown of food into soluble compounds, facilitating proper digestion
Snake|snake|Even nonvenomous snakebites (like any animal bite) cause tissue damage.
Snake|snake|209 Certain birds, mammals, and other snakes (such as kingsnakes) that prey on venomous snakes have developed resistance and even immunity to certain venoms.
Snake|snake|243  Venomous snakes include three families of snakes, and do not constitute a formal taxonomic classification group.
Snake|snake|"The colloquial term ""poisonous snake"" is generally an incorrect label for snakes"
Snake|snake|A poison is inhaled or ingested, whereas venom produced by snakes is injected into its victim via fangs
Snake|snake|There are, however, two exceptions
Snake|snake|Rhabdophis sequesters toxins from the toads it eats, then secretes them from nuchal glands to ward off predators; and a small unusual population of garter snakes in the US state of Oregon retains enough toxins in their livers from ingested newts to be effectively poisonous to small local predators (such as crows and foxes).Snake venoms are complex mixtures of proteins, and are stored in venom glands at the back of the head
Snake|snake|In all venomous snakes, these glands open through ducts into grooved or hollow teeth in the upper jaw.
Snake|snake|243  The proteins can potentially be a mix of neurotoxins (which attack the nervous system), hemotoxins (which attack the circulatory system), cytotoxins, bungarotoxins, and many other toxins that affect the body in different ways
Snake|snake|Almost all snake venom contains hyaluronidase, an enzyme that ensures rapid diffusion of the venom.
Snake|snake|243 Venomous snakes that use hemotoxins usually have fangs in the front of their mouths, making it easier for them to inject the venom into their victims
Snake|snake|Some snakes that use neurotoxins (such as the mangrove snake) have fangs in the back of their mouths, with the fangs curled backwards
Snake|snake|This makes it difficult both for the snake to use its venom and for scientists to milk them
Snake|snake|"Elapids, however, such as cobras and kraits are proteroglyphous—they possess hollow fangs that cannot be erected toward the front of their mouths, and cannot ""stab"" like a viper"
Snake|snake|They must actually bite the victim.
Snake|snake|242 It has been suggested that all snakes may be venomous to a certain degree, with harmless snakes having weak venom and no fangs
Snake|snake|"According to this theory, most snakes that are labelled ""nonvenomous"" would be considered harmless because they either lack a venom delivery method or are incapable of delivering enough to endanger a human"
Snake|snake|The theory postulates that snakes may have evolved from a common lizard ancestor that was venomous, and also that venomous lizards like the gila monster, beaded lizard, monitor lizards, and the now-extinct mosasaurs, may have derived from this same common ancestor
Snake|snake|"They share this ""venom clade"" with various other saurian species."
Snake|snake|Colubrids – boomslangs, tree snakes, vine snakes, cat snakes, although not all colubrids are venomous.
Snake|snake|209
Snake|snake|Although a wide range of reproductive modes are used by snakes, all employ internal fertilization
Snake|snake|This is accomplished by means of paired, forked hemipenes, which are stored, inverted, in the male's tail
Snake|snake|The hemipenes are often grooved, hooked, or spined—designed to grip the walls of the female's cloaca.Most species of snakes lay eggs which they abandon shortly after laying
Snake|snake|However, a few species (such as the king cobra) construct nests and stay in the vicinity of the hatchlings after incubation
Snake|snake|Most pythons coil around their egg-clutches and remain with them until they hatch
Snake|snake|A female python will not leave the eggs, except to occasionally bask in the sun or drink water
Snake|snake|"She will even ""shiver"" to generate heat to incubate the eggs.Some species of snake are ovoviviparous and retain the eggs within their bodies until they are almost ready to hatch"
Snake|snake|Several species of snake, such as the boa constrictor and green anaconda, are fully viviparous, nourishing their young through a placenta as well as a yolk sac; this is highly unusual among reptiles, and normally found in requiem sharks or placental mammals
Snake|snake|Retention of eggs and live birth are most often associated with colder environments.
Snake|snake|Sexual selection in snakes is demonstrated by the 3,000 species that each use different tactics in acquiring mates
Snake|snake|Ritual combat between males for the females they want to mate with includes topping, a behavior exhibited by most viperids in which one male will twist around the vertically elevated fore body of its opponent and force it downward
Snake|snake|It is common for neck-biting to occur while the snakes are entwined.
Snake|snake|Parthenogenesis is a natural form of reproduction in which growth and development of embryos occur without fertilization
Snake|snake|Agkistrodon contortrix (copperhead) and Agkistrodon piscivorus (cottonmouth) can reproduce by facultative parthenogenesis, meaning that they are capable of switching from a sexual mode of reproduction to an asexual mode
Snake|snake|The most likely type of parthenogenesis to occur is automixis with terminal fusion, a process in which two terminal products from the same meiosis fuse to form a diploid zygote
Snake|snake|This process leads to genome-wide homozygosity, expression of deleterious recessive alleles, and often to developmental abnormalities
Snake|snake|Both captive-born and wild-born copperheads and cottonmouths appear to be capable of this form of parthenogenesis.Reproduction in squamate reptiles is almost exclusively sexual
Snake|snake|Males ordinarily have a ZZ pair of sex-determining chromosomes, and females a ZW pair
Snake|snake|However, the Colombian Rainbow boa (Epicrates maurus) can also reproduce by facultative parthenogenesis, resulting in production of WW female progeny
Snake|snake|The WW females are likely produced by terminal automixis.
Snake|snake|In regions where winters are too cold for snakes to tolerate while remaining active, local species will enter a period of brumation
Snake|snake|Unlike hibernation, in which the dormant mammals are actually asleep, brumating reptiles are awake but inactive
Snake|snake|Individual snakes may brumate in burrows, under rock piles, or inside fallen trees, or large numbers of snakes may clump together in hibernacula.
Snake|snake|All snakes are strictly carnivorous, preying on small animals including lizards, frogs, other snakes, small mammals, birds, eggs, fish, snails, worms, and insects.[1] Snakes cannot bite or tear their food to pieces so must swallow their prey whole
Snake|snake|The eating habits of a snake are largely influenced by body size; smaller snakes eat smaller prey
Snake|snake|Juvenile pythons might start out feeding on lizards or mice and graduate to small deer or antelope as an adult, for example.
Snake|snake|The snake's jaw is a complex structure
Snake|snake|Contrary to the popular belief that snakes can dislocate their jaws, they have an extremely flexible lower jaw, the two halves of which are not rigidly attached, and numerous other joints in the skull, which allow the snake to open its mouth wide enough to swallow prey whole, even if it is larger in diameter than the snake itself
Snake|snake|For example, the African egg-eating snake has flexible jaws adapted for eating eggs much larger than the diameter of its head.
Snake|snake|81  This snake has no teeth, but does have bony protrusions on the inside edge of its spine, which it uses to break the shell when eating eggs.
Snake|snake|81 
Snake|snake|The majority of snakes eat a variety of prey animals, but there is some specialization in certain species
Snake|snake|King cobras and the Australian bandy-bandy consume other snakes
Snake|snake|Species of the family Pareidae have more teeth on the right side of their mouths than on the left, as they mostly prey on snails and the shells usually spiral clockwise.
Snake|snake|184 Some snakes have a venomous bite, which they use to kill their prey before eating it
Snake|snake|Other snakes kill their prey by constriction, while some swallow their prey when it is still alive.
Snake|snake|81 
Snake|snake|After eating, snakes become dormant to allow the process of digestion to take place; this is an intense activity, especially after consumption of large prey
Snake|snake|In species that feed only sporadically, the entire intestine enters a reduced state between meals to conserve energy
Snake|snake|The digestive system is then 'up-regulated' to full capacity within 48 hours of prey consumption
Snake|snake|"Being ectothermic (""cold-blooded""), the surrounding temperature plays an important role in the digestion process"
Snake|snake|The ideal temperature for snakes to digest food is 30 °C (86 °F)
Snake|snake|There is a huge amount of metabolic energy involved in a snake's digestion, for example the surface body temperature of the South American rattlesnake (Crotalus durissus)  increases by as much as 1.2 °C (2.2 °F) during the digestive process
Snake|snake|If a snake is disturbed after having eaten recently, it will often regurgitate its prey to be able to escape the perceived threat
Snake|snake|When undisturbed, the digestive process is highly efficient; the snake's digestive enzymes dissolve and absorb everything but the prey's hair (or feathers) and claws, which are excreted along with waste.
Snake|snake|Common prey for snakes include but are not limited to
Snake|snake|mice, rats, lizards (specifically
Snake|snake|small lizards such as [Albemarlensis],and insects such as spiders.
Snake|snake|Hooding (expansion of the neck area) is a visual deterrent, mostly seen in cobras (elapids), and is primarily controlled by rib muscles
Snake|snake|Hooding can be accompanied by spitting venom towards the threatening object, and producing a specialized sound; hissing
Snake|snake|Studies on captive cobras showed that 13 to 22% of the body length is raised during hooding.
Snake|snake|The lack of limbs does not impede the movement of snakes
Snake|snake|They have developed several different modes of locomotion to deal with particular environments
Snake|snake|Unlike the gaits of limbed animals, which form a continuum, each mode of snake locomotion is discrete and distinct from the others; transitions between modes are abrupt.
Snake|snake|Lateral undulation is the sole mode of aquatic locomotion, and the most common mode of terrestrial locomotion
Snake|snake|"In this mode, the body of the snake alternately flexes to the left and right, resulting in a series of rearward-moving ""waves"""
Snake|snake|While this movement appears rapid, snakes have rarely been documented moving faster than two body-lengths per second, often much less
Snake|snake|This mode of movement has the same net cost of transport (calories burned per meter moved) as running in lizards of the same mass.Terrestrial lateral undulation is the most common mode of terrestrial locomotion for most snake species
Snake|snake|In this mode, the posteriorly moving waves push against contact points in the environment, such as rocks, twigs, irregularities in the soil, etc
Snake|snake|Each of these environmental objects, in turn, generates a reaction force directed forward and towards the midline of the snake, resulting in forward thrust while the lateral components cancel out
Snake|snake|The speed of this movement depends upon the density of push-points in the environment, with a medium density of about 8 along the snake's length being ideal
Snake|snake|The wave speed is precisely the same as the snake speed, and as a result, every point on the snake's body follows the path of the point ahead of it, allowing snakes to move through very dense vegetation and small openings.When swimming, the waves become larger as they move down the snake's body, and the wave travels backwards faster than the snake moves forwards
Snake|snake|Thrust is generated by pushing their body against the water, resulting in the observed slip
Snake|snake|In spite of overall similarities, studies show that the pattern of muscle activation is different in aquatic versus terrestrial lateral undulation, which justifies calling them separate modes
Snake|snake|All snakes can laterally undulate forward (with backward-moving waves), but only sea snakes have been observed reversing the motion (moving backwards with forward-moving waves).
Snake|snake|"Most often employed by colubroid snakes (colubrids, elapids, and vipers) when the snake must move in an environment that lacks irregularities to push against (rendering lateral undulation impossible), such as a slick mud flat, or a sand dune, sidewinding is a modified form of lateral undulation in which all of the body segments oriented in one direction remain in contact with the ground, while the other segments are lifted up, resulting in a peculiar ""rolling"" motion"
Snake|snake|This mode of locomotion overcomes the slippery nature of sand or mud by pushing off with only static portions on the body, thereby minimizing slipping
Snake|snake|The static nature of the contact points can be shown from the tracks of a sidewinding snake, which show each belly scale imprint, without any smearing
Snake|snake|This mode of locomotion has very low caloric cost, less than ⅓ of the cost for a lizard to move the same distance
Snake|snake|Contrary to popular belief, there is no evidence that sidewinding is associated with the sand being hot.
Snake|snake|When push-points are absent, but there is not enough space to use sidewinding because of lateral constraints, such as in tunnels, snakes rely on concertina locomotion
Snake|snake|In this mode, the snake braces the posterior portion of its body against the tunnel wall while the front of the snake extends and straightens
Snake|snake|The front portion then flexes and forms an anchor point, and the posterior is straightened and pulled forwards
Snake|snake|This mode of locomotion is slow and very demanding, up to seven times the cost of laterally undulating over the same distance
Snake|snake|This high cost is due to the repeated stops and starts of portions of the body as well as the necessity of using active muscular effort to brace against the tunnel walls.
Snake|snake|The movement of snakes in arboreal habitats has only recently been studied
Snake|snake|While on tree branches, snakes use several modes of locomotion depending on species and bark texture
Snake|snake|In general, snakes will use a modified form of concertina locomotion on smooth branches, but will laterally undulate if contact points are available
Snake|snake|Snakes move faster on small branches and when contact points are present, in contrast to limbed animals, which do better on large branches with little 'clutter'.Gliding snakes (Chrysopelea) of Southeast Asia launch themselves from branch tips, spreading their ribs and laterally undulating as they glide between trees
Snake|snake|These snakes can perform a controlled glide for hundreds of feet depending upon launch altitude and can even turn in midair.
Snake|snake|The slowest mode of snake locomotion is rectilinear locomotion, which is also the only one where the snake does not need to bend its body laterally, though it may do so when turning
Snake|snake|In this mode, the belly scales are lifted and pulled forward before being placed down and the body pulled over them
Snake|snake|Waves of movement and stasis pass posteriorly, resulting in a series of ripples in the skin
Snake|snake|The ribs of the snake do not move in this mode of locomotion and this method is most often used by large pythons, boas, and vipers when stalking prey across open ground as the snake's movements are subtle and harder to detect by their prey in this manner.
Snake|snake|Snakes do not ordinarily prey on humans
Snake|snake|Unless startled or injured, most snakes prefer to avoid contact and will not attack humans
Snake|snake|With the exception of large constrictors, nonvenomous snakes are not a threat to humans
Snake|snake|The bite of a nonvenomous snake is usually harmless; their teeth are not adapted for tearing or inflicting a deep puncture wound, but rather grabbing and holding
Snake|snake|Although the possibility of infection and tissue damage is present in the bite of a nonvenomous snake, venomous snakes present far greater hazard to humans.
Snake|snake|"209  The World Health Organisation (WHO) lists snakebite under the ""other neglected conditions"" category.Documented deaths resulting from snake bites are uncommon"
Snake|snake|Nonfatal bites from venomous snakes may result in the need for amputation of a limb or part thereof
Snake|snake|Of the roughly 725 species of venomous snakes worldwide, only 250 are able to kill a human with one bite
Snake|snake|Australia averages only one fatal snake bite per year
Snake|snake|In India, 250,000 snakebites are recorded in a single year, with as many as 50,000 recorded initial deaths
Snake|snake|The WHO estimates that on the order of 100 000 people die each year as a result of snake bites, and around three times as many amputations and other permanent disabilities are caused by snakebites annually.The treatment for a snakebite is as variable as the bite itself
Snake|snake|The most common and effective method is through antivenom (or antivenin), a serum made from the venom of the snake
Snake|snake|Some antivenom is species-specific (monovalent) while some is made for use with multiple species in mind (polyvalent)
Snake|snake|In the United States for example, all species of venomous snakes are pit vipers, with the exception of the coral snake
Snake|snake|To produce antivenom, a mixture of the venoms of the different species of rattlesnakes, copperheads, and cottonmouths is injected into the body of a horse in ever-increasing dosages until the horse is immunized
Snake|snake|Blood is then extracted from the immunized horse
Snake|snake|The serum is separated and further purified and freeze-dried
Snake|snake|It is reconstituted with sterile water and becomes antivenom
Snake|snake|For this reason, people who are allergic to horses are more likely to suffer an allergic reaction to antivenom
Snake|snake|Antivenom for the more dangerous species (such as mambas, taipans, and cobras) is made in a similar manner in India, South Africa, and Australia, although these antivenoms are species-specific.
Snake|snake|In some parts of the world, especially in India, snake charming is a roadside show performed by a charmer
Snake|snake|In such a show, the snake charmer carries a basket containing a snake that he seemingly charms by playing tunes with his flutelike musical instrument, to which the snake responds
Snake|snake|The snake is in fact responding to the movement of the flute, not the sound it makes, as snakes lack external ears (though they do have internal ears).The Wildlife Protection Act of 1972 in India technically prohibits snake charming on the grounds of reducing animal cruelty
Snake|snake|Other types of snake charmers use a snake and mongoose show, where the two animals have a mock fight; however, this is not very common, as the animals may be seriously injured or killed
Snake|snake|Snake charming as a profession is dying out in India because of competition from modern forms of entertainment and environment laws proscribing the practice
Snake|snake|Many Indians have never seen snake charming and it is becoming a folktale of the past.
Snake|snake|The Irulas tribe of Andhra Pradesh and Tamil Nadu in India have been hunter-gatherers in the hot, dry plains forests, and have practiced the art of snake catching for generations
Snake|snake|They have a vast knowledge of snakes in the field
Snake|snake|They generally catch the snakes with the help of a simple stick
Snake|snake|Earlier, the Irulas caught thousands of snakes for the snake-skin industry
Snake|snake|After the complete ban of the snake-skin industry in India and protection of all snakes under the Indian Wildlife (Protection) Act 1972, they formed the Irula Snake Catcher's Cooperative and switched to catching snakes for removal of venom, releasing them in the wild after four extractions
Snake|snake|The venom so collected is used for producing life-saving antivenom, biomedical research and for other medicinal products
Snake|snake|The Irulas are also known to eat some of the snakes they catch and are very useful in rat extermination in the villages.
Snake|snake|Despite the existence of snake charmers, there have also been professional snake catchers or wranglers
Snake|snake|Modern-day snake trapping involves a herpetologist using a long stick with a V- shaped end
Snake|snake|Some television show hosts, like Bill Haast, Austin Stevens, Steve Irwin, and Jeff Corwin, prefer to catch them using bare hands.
Snake|snake|Although snakes are not commonly thought of as food, their consumption is acceptable in some cultures and may even be considered a delicacy
Snake|snake|Snake soup is popular in Cantonese cuisine, consumed by locals in the autumn to warm their bodies
Snake|snake|Western cultures document the consumption of snakes only under extreme circumstances of hunger, with the exception of cooked rattlesnake meat, which is commonly consumed in Texas and parts of the Midwestern United States.
Snake|snake|In Asian countries such as China, Taiwan, Thailand, Indonesia, Vietnam, and Cambodia, drinking the blood of a snake—particularly the cobra—is believed to increase sexual virility
Snake|snake|When possible, the blood is drained while the cobra is still alive, and it is usually mixed with some form of liquor to improve the taste.The use of snakes in alcohol is accepted in some Asian countries
Snake|snake|In such cases, one or more snakes are left to steep in a jar or container of liquor, as this is claimed to make the liquor stronger (as well as more expensive)
Snake|snake|"One example of this is the Habu snake, which is sometimes placed in the Okinawan liqueur Habushu (ブ酒), also known as ""Habu Sake"".Snake wine (蛇酒) is an alcoholic beverage produced by infusing whole snakes in rice wine or grain alcohol"
Snake|snake|First recorded as being consumed in China during the Western Zhou dynasty, this drink is considered an important curative and is believed to reinvigorate a person according to traditional Chinese medicine.
Snake|snake|In the Western world, some snakes are kept as pets, especially docile species such as the ball python and corn snake
Snake|snake|To meet the demand, a captive breeding industry has developed
Snake|snake|Snakes bred in captivity are considered preferable to specimens caught in the wild and tend to make better pets
Snake|snake|Compared with more traditional types of companion animal, snakes can be very low-maintenance pets; they require minimal space, as most common species do not exceed 5 feet (1.5 m) in length, and can be fed relatively infrequently—usually once every five to 14 days
Snake|snake|Certain snakes have a lifespan of more than 40 years if given proper care.
Snake|snake|In ancient Mesopotamia, Nirah, the messenger god of Ištaran, was represented as a serpent on kudurrus, or boundary stones
Snake|snake|Representations of two intertwined serpents are common in Sumerian art and Neo-Sumerian artwork and still appear sporadically on cylinder seals and amulets until as late as the thirteenth century BC
Snake|snake|The horned viper (Cerastes cerastes) appears in Kassite and Neo-Assyrian kudurrus and is invoked in Assyrian texts as a magical protective entity
Snake|snake|A dragon-like creature with horns, the body and neck of a snake, the forelegs of a lion, and the hind-legs of a bird appears in Mesopotamian art from the Akkadian Period until the Hellenistic Period (323 BC–31 BC)
Snake|snake|"This creature, known in Akkadian as the mušḫuššu, meaning ""furious serpent"", was used as a symbol for particular deities and also as a general protective emblem"
Snake|snake|It seems to have originally been the attendant of the Underworld god Ninazu, but later became the attendant to the Hurrian storm-god Tishpak, as well as, later, Ninazu's son Ningishzida, the Babylonian national god Marduk, the scribal god Nabu, and the Assyrian national god Ashur.In Egyptian history, the snake occupies a primary role with the Nile cobra adorning the crown of the pharaoh in ancient times
Snake|snake|It was worshipped as one of the gods and was also used for sinister purposes
Snake|snake|murder of an adversary and ritual suicide (Cleopatra)
Snake|snake|The ouroboros was a well-known ancient Egyptian symbol of a serpent swallowing its own tail
Snake|snake|"The precursor to the ouroboros was the ""Many-Faced"", a serpent with five heads, who, according to the Amduat, the oldest surviving Book of the Afterlife, was said to coil around the corpse of the sun god Ra protectively"
Snake|snake|"The earliest surviving depiction of a ""true"" ouroboros comes from the gilded shrines in the tomb of Tutankhamun"
Snake|snake|"In the early centuries AD, the ouroboros was adopted as a symbol by Gnostic Christians and chapter 136 of the Pistis Sophia, an early Gnostic text, describes ""a great dragon whose tail is in its mouth"""
Snake|snake|"In medieval alchemy, the ouroboros became a typical western dragon with wings, legs, and a tail.In the Bible, King Nahash of Ammon, whose name means ""Snake"", is depicted very negatively, as a particularly cruel and despicable enemy of the ancient Hebrews."
Snake|snake|The ancient Greeks used the Gorgoneion, a depiction of a hideous face with serpents for hair, as an apotropaic symbol to ward off evil
Snake|snake|In a Greek myth described by Pseudo-Apollodorus in his Bibliotheca, Medusa was a Gorgon with serpents for hair whose gaze turned all those who looked at her to stone and was slain by the hero Perseus
Snake|snake|In the Roman poet Ovid's Metamorphoses, Medusa is said to have once been a beautiful priestess of Athena, whom Athena turned into a serpent-haired monster after she was raped by the god Poseidon in Athena's temple
Snake|snake|In another myth referenced by the Boeotian poet Hesiod and described in detail by Pseudo-Apollodorus, the hero Heracles is said to have slain the Lernaean Hydra, a multiple-headed serpent which dwelt in the swamps of Lerna.The legendary account of the foundation of Thebes mentioned a monster snake guarding the spring from which the new settlement was to draw its water
Snake|snake|"In fighting and killing the snake, the companions of the founder Cadmus all perished – leading to the term ""Cadmean victory"" (i.e"
Snake|snake|a victory involving one's own ruin).
Snake|snake|India is often called the land of snakes and is steeped in tradition regarding snakes
Snake|snake|Snakes are worshipped as gods even today with many women pouring milk on snake pits (despite snakes' aversion for milk)
Snake|snake|The cobra is seen on the neck of Shiva and Vishnu is depicted often as sleeping on a seven-headed snake or within the coils of a serpent
Snake|snake|There are also several temples in India solely for cobras sometimes called Nagraj (King of Snakes) and it is believed that snakes are symbols of fertility
Snake|snake|There is a Hindu festival called Nag Panchami each year on which day snakes are venerated and prayed to
Snake|snake|See also Nāga.In India there is another mythology about snakes
Snake|snake|"Commonly known in Hindi as ""Ichchhadhari"" snakes"
Snake|snake|Such snakes can take the form of any living creature, but prefer human form
Snake|snake|"These mythical snakes possess a valuable gem called ""Mani"", which is more brilliant than diamond"
Snake|snake|There are many stories in India about greedy people trying to possess this gem and ending up getting killed.The snake is one of the 12 celestial animals of Chinese zodiac, in the Chinese calendar.Many ancient Peruvian cultures worshipped nature
Snake|snake|They emphasized animals and often depicted snakes in their art.
Snake|snake|Snakes are used in Hinduism as a part of ritual worship
Snake|snake|In the annual Nag Panchami festival, participants worship either live cobras or images of Nāgas
Snake|snake|Lord Shiva is depicted in most images with a snake coiled around his neck
Snake|snake|Puranic literature includes various stories associated with snakes, for example Shesha is said to hold all the planets of the Universe on his hoods and to constantly sing the glories of Vishnu from all his mouths
Snake|snake|Other notable snakes in Hinduism are Vasuki, Takshaka, Karkotaka, and Pingala
Snake|snake|The term Nāga is used to refer to entities that take the form of large snakes in Hinduism and Buddhism.Snakes have been widely revered in many cultures, such as in ancient Greece where the serpent was seen as a healer
Snake|snake|Asclepius carried a serpent wound around his wand, a symbol seen today on many ambulances
Snake|snake|In Judaism, the snake of brass is also a symbol of healing, of one's life being saved from imminent death.In religious terms, the snake and jaguar were arguably the most important animals in ancient Mesoamerica
Snake|snake|"""In states of ecstasy, lords dance a serpent dance; great descending snakes adorn and support buildings from Chichen Itza to Tenochtitlan, and the Nahuatl word coatl meaning serpent or twin, forms part of primary deities such as Mixcoatl, Quetzalcoatl, and Coatlicue."" In the Maya and Aztec calendars, the fifth day of the week was known as Snake Day."
Snake|snake|In some parts of Christianity, the redemptive work of Jesus Christ is compared to saving one's life through beholding the Nehushtan (serpent of brass)
Snake|snake|Snake handlers use snakes as an integral part of church worship, to demonstrate their faith in divine protection
Snake|snake|However, more commonly in Christianity, the serpent has been depicted as a representative of evil and sly plotting, as seen in the description in Genesis of a snake tempting Eve in the Garden of Eden
Snake|snake|Saint Patrick is purported to have expelled all snakes from Ireland while converting the country to Christianity in the 5th century, thus explaining the absence of snakes there.In Christianity and Judaism, the snake makes its infamous appearance in the first book of the Bible when a serpent appears before Adam and Eve and tempts them with the forbidden fruit from the Tree of Knowledge
Snake|snake|The snake returns in the Book of Exodus when Moses turns his staff into a snake as a sign of God's power, and later when he makes the Nehushtan, a bronze snake on a pole that when looked at cured the people of bites from the snakes that plagued them in the desert
Snake|snake|The serpent makes its final appearance symbolizing Satan in the Book of Revelation
Snake|snake|"""And he laid hold on the dragon the old serpent, which is the devil and Satan, and bound him for a thousand years.""In Neo-Paganism and Wicca, the snake is seen as a symbol of wisdom and knowledge."
Snake|snake|Several compounds from snake venoms are being researched as potential treatments or preventatives for pain, cancers, arthritis, stroke, heart disease, hemophilia, and hypertension, and to control bleeding (e.g
Snake|snake|during surgery).

Reptile|snake|Reptiles, as most commonly defined, are the animals in the class Reptilia , a paraphyletic grouping comprising all amniotes except synapsids (mammals and their extinct relatives) and Aves (birds)
Reptile|snake|Living reptiles comprise turtles, crocodilians, squamates (lizards & snakes) and rhynchocephalians (tuatara)
Reptile|snake|In the traditional Linnaean classification system, birds are considered a separate class to reptiles
Reptile|snake|However, crocodilians are more closely related to birds than they are to other living reptiles, and so modern cladistic classification systems include birds within Reptilia, redefining the term as a clade
Reptile|snake|Other cladistic definitions abandon the term reptile altogether in favor of the clade Sauropsida, which refers to all animals more closely related to modern reptiles than to mammals
Reptile|snake|The study of the traditional reptile orders, historically combined with that of modern amphibians, is called herpetology.
Reptile|snake|The earliest known proto-reptiles originated around 312 million years ago during the Carboniferous period, having evolved from advanced reptiliomorph tetrapods which became increasingly adapted to life on dry land
Reptile|snake|"The earliest known eureptile (""true reptile"") was Hylonomus, a small and superficially lizard-like animal"
Reptile|snake|Genetic and fossil data argues that the two largest lineages of reptiles, Archosauromorpha (crocodilians, birds and kin) and Lepidosauromorpha (lizards and kin), diverged near the end of the Permian period
Reptile|snake|In addition to the living reptiles, there are many diverse groups that are now extinct, in some cases due to mass extinction events
Reptile|snake|In particular, the Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event wiped out the pterosaurs, plesiosaurs, and all non-avian dinosaurs alongside many species of crocodyliforms, and squamates (e.g., mosasaurs)
Reptile|snake|Modern non-bird reptiles inhabit all the continents except Antarctica
Reptile|snake|Reptiles are tetrapod vertebrates, creatures that either have four limbs or, like snakes, are descended from four-limbed ancestors
Reptile|snake|Unlike amphibians, reptiles do not have an aquatic larval stage
Reptile|snake|Most reptiles are oviparous, although several species of squamates are viviparous, as were some extinct aquatic clades – the fetus develops within the mother, using a (non-mammalian) placenta rather than contained in an eggshell
Reptile|snake|As amniotes, reptile eggs are surrounded by membranes for protection and transport, which adapt them to reproduction on dry land
Reptile|snake|Many of the viviparous species feed their fetuses through various forms of placenta analogous to those of mammals, with some providing initial care for their hatchlings
Reptile|snake|Extant reptiles range in size from a tiny gecko, Sphaerodactylus ariasae, which can grow up to 17 mm (0.7 in) to the saltwater crocodile, Crocodylus porosus, which can reach 6 m (19.7 ft) in length and weigh over 1,000 kg (2,200 lb).
Reptile|snake|In the 18th century, the reptiles were, from the outset of classification, grouped with the amphibians
Reptile|snake|"Linnaeus, working from species-poor Sweden, where the common adder and grass snake are often found hunting in water, included all reptiles and amphibians in class ""III – Amphibia"" in his Systema Naturæ."
Reptile|snake|The terms reptile and amphibian were largely interchangeable, reptile (from Latin repere, 'to creep') being preferred by the French
Reptile|snake|Josephus Nicolaus Laurenti was the first to formally use the term Reptilia for an expanded selection of reptiles and amphibians basically similar to that of Linnaeus
Reptile|snake|Today, the two groups are still commonly treated under the single heading herpetology.
Reptile|snake|It was not until the beginning of the 19th century that it became clear that reptiles and amphibians are, in fact, quite different animals, and Pierre André Latreille erected the class Batracia (1825) for the latter, dividing the tetrapods into the four familiar classes of reptiles, amphibians, birds, and mammals
Reptile|snake|"The British anatomist Thomas Henry Huxley made Latreille's definition popular and, together with Richard Owen, expanded Reptilia to include the various fossil ""antediluvian monsters"", including dinosaurs and the mammal-like (synapsid) Dicynodon he helped describe"
Reptile|snake|This was not the only possible classification scheme
Reptile|snake|In the Hunterian lectures delivered at the Royal College of Surgeons in 1863, Huxley grouped the vertebrates into mammals, sauroids, and ichthyoids (the latter containing the fishes and amphibians)
Reptile|snake|He subsequently proposed the names of Sauropsida and Ichthyopsida for the latter two groups
Reptile|snake|In 1866, Haeckel demonstrated that vertebrates could be divided based on their reproductive strategies, and that reptiles, birds, and mammals were united by the amniotic egg.
Reptile|snake|The terms Sauropsida ('lizard faces') and Theropsida ('beast faces') were used again in 1916 by E.S
Reptile|snake|Goodrich to distinguish between lizards, birds, and their relatives on the one hand (Sauropsida) and mammals and their extinct relatives (Theropsida) on the other
Reptile|snake|Goodrich supported this division by the nature of the hearts and blood vessels in each group, and other features, such as the structure of the forebrain
Reptile|snake|"According to Goodrich, both lineages evolved from an earlier stem group, Protosauria (""first lizards"") in which he included some animals today considered reptile-like amphibians, as well as early reptiles.In 1956, D.M.S"
Reptile|snake|Watson observed that the first two groups diverged very early in reptilian history, so he divided Goodrich's Protosauria between them
Reptile|snake|He also reinterpreted Sauropsida and Theropsida to exclude birds and mammals, respectively
Reptile|snake|"Thus his Sauropsida included Procolophonia, Eosuchia, Millerosauria, Chelonia (turtles), Squamata (lizards and snakes), Rhynchocephalia, Crocodilia, ""thecodonts"" (paraphyletic basal Archosauria), non-avian dinosaurs, pterosaurs, ichthyosaurs, and sauropterygians.In the late 19th century, a number of definitions of Reptilia were offered"
Reptile|snake|The traits listed by Lydekker in 1896, for example, include a single occipital condyle, a jaw joint formed by the quadrate and articular bones, and certain characteristics of the vertebrae
Reptile|snake|The animals singled out by these formulations, the amniotes other than the mammals and the birds, are still those considered reptiles today.
Reptile|snake|The synapsid/sauropsid division supplemented another approach, one that split the reptiles into four subclasses based on the number and position of temporal fenestrae, openings in the sides of the skull behind the eyes
Reptile|snake|This classification was initiated by Henry Fairfield Osborn and elaborated and made popular by Romer's classic Vertebrate Paleontology
Reptile|snake|Those four subclasses were:
Reptile|snake|The composition of Euryapsida was uncertain
Reptile|snake|Ichthyosaurs were, at times, considered to have arisen independently of the other euryapsids, and given the older name Parapsida
Reptile|snake|Parapsida was later discarded as a group for the most part (ichthyosaurs being classified as incertae sedis or with Euryapsida)
Reptile|snake|However, four (or three if Euryapsida is merged into Diapsida) subclasses remained more or less universal for non-specialist work throughout the 20th century
Reptile|snake|It has largely been abandoned by recent researchers
Reptile|snake|In particular, the anapsid condition has been found to occur so variably among unrelated groups that it is not now considered a useful distinction.
Reptile|snake|By the early 21st century, vertebrate paleontologists were beginning to adopt phylogenetic taxonomy, in which all groups are defined in such a way as to be monophyletic; that is, groups which include all descendants of a particular ancestor
Reptile|snake|The reptiles as historically defined are paraphyletic, since they exclude both birds and mammals
Reptile|snake|These respectively evolved from dinosaurs and from early therapsids, which were both traditionally called reptiles
Reptile|snake|Birds are more closely related to crocodilians than the latter are to the rest of extant reptiles
Reptile|snake|Colin Tudge wrote:
Reptile|snake|Mammals are a clade, and therefore the cladists are happy to acknowledge the traditional taxon Mammalia; and birds, too, are a clade, universally ascribed to the formal taxon Aves
Reptile|snake|Mammalia and Aves are, in fact, subclades within the grand clade of the Amniota
Reptile|snake|But the traditional class Reptilia is not a clade
Reptile|snake|It is just a section of the clade Amniota
Reptile|snake|the section that is left after the Mammalia and Aves have been hived off
Reptile|snake|It cannot be defined by synapomorphies, as is the proper way
Reptile|snake|Instead, it is defined by a combination of the features it has and the features it lacks
Reptile|snake|reptiles are the amniotes that lack fur or feathers
Reptile|snake|At best, the cladists suggest, we could say that the traditional Reptilia are 'non-avian, non-mammalian amniotes'.
Reptile|snake|When Sauropsida was used, it often had the same content or even the same definition as Reptilia
Reptile|snake|In 1988, Jacques Gauthier proposed a cladistic definition of Reptilia as a monophyletic node-based crown group containing turtles, lizards and snakes, crocodilians, and birds, their common ancestor and all its descendants
Reptile|snake|While Gauthier's definition was close to the modern consensus, nonetheless, it became considered inadequate because the actual relationship of turtles to other reptiles was not yet well understood at this time
Reptile|snake|Major revisions since have included the reassignment of synapsids as non-reptiles, and classification of turtles as diapsids.A variety of other definitions were proposed by other scientists in the years following Gauthier's paper
Reptile|snake|The first such new definition, which attempted to adhere to the standards of the PhyloCode, was published by Modesto and Anderson in 2004
Reptile|snake|Modesto and Anderson reviewed the many previous definitions and proposed a modified definition, which they intended to retain most traditional content of the group while keeping it stable and monophyletic
Reptile|snake|They defined Reptilia as all amniotes closer to Lacerta agilis and Crocodylus niloticus than to Homo sapiens
Reptile|snake|This stem-based definition is equivalent to the more common definition of Sauropsida, which Modesto and Anderson synonymized with Reptilia, since the latter is better known and more frequently used
Reptile|snake|Unlike most previous definitions of Reptilia, however, Modesto and Anderson's definition includes birds, as they are within the clade that includes both lizards and crocodiles.
Reptile|snake|"The cladogram presented here illustrates the ""family tree"" of reptiles, and follows a simplified version of the relationships found by M.S"
Reptile|snake|Lee, in 2013
Reptile|snake|All genetic studies have supported the hypothesis that turtles are diapsids; some have placed turtles within Archosauromorpha, though a few have recovered turtles as Lepidosauromorpha instead
Reptile|snake|The cladogram below used a combination of genetic (molecular) and fossil (morphological) data to obtain its results.
Reptile|snake|The placement of turtles has historically been highly variable
Reptile|snake|Classically, turtles were considered to be related to the primitive anapsid reptiles
Reptile|snake|Molecular work has usually placed turtles within the diapsids
Reptile|snake|As of 2013, three turtle genomes have been sequenced
Reptile|snake|The results place turtles as a sister clade to the archosaurs, the group that includes crocodiles, dinosaurs, and birds
Reptile|snake|However, in their comparative analysis of the timing of organogenesis, Werneburg and Sánchez-Villagra (2009) found support for the hypothesis that turtles belong to a separate clade within Sauropsida, outside the saurian clade altogether.
Reptile|snake|The origin of the reptiles lies about 310–320 million years ago, in the steaming swamps of the late Carboniferous period, when the first reptiles evolved from advanced reptiliomorphs.The oldest known animal that may have been an amniote is Casineria (though it may have been a temnospondyl)
Reptile|snake|A series of footprints from the fossil strata of Nova Scotia dated to 315 Ma show typical reptilian toes and imprints of scales
Reptile|snake|These tracks are attributed to Hylonomus, the oldest unquestionable reptile known.
Reptile|snake|It was a small, lizard-like animal, about 20 to 30 centimetres (7.9 to 11.8 in) long, with numerous sharp teeth indicating an insectivorous diet
Reptile|snake|Other examples include Westlothiana (for the moment considered a reptiliomorph rather than a true amniote) and Paleothyris, both of similar build and presumably similar habit.
Reptile|snake|The earliest amniotes, including stem-reptiles (those amniotes closer to modern reptiles than to mammals), were largely overshadowed by larger stem-tetrapods, such as Cochleosaurus, and remained a small, inconspicuous part of the fauna until the Carboniferous Rainforest Collapse
Reptile|snake|This sudden collapse affected several large groups
Reptile|snake|Primitive tetrapods were particularly devastated, while stem-reptiles fared better, being ecologically adapted to the drier conditions that followed
Reptile|snake|Primitive tetrapods, like modern amphibians, need to return to water to lay eggs; in contrast, amniotes, like modern reptiles – whose eggs possess a shell that allows them to be laid on land – were better adapted to the new conditions
Reptile|snake|Amniotes acquired new niches at a faster rate than before the collapse and at a much faster rate than primitive tetrapods
Reptile|snake|They acquired new feeding strategies including herbivory and carnivory, previously only having been insectivores and piscivores
Reptile|snake|From this point forward, reptiles dominated communities and had a greater diversity than primitive tetrapods, setting the stage for the Mesozoic (known as the Age of Reptiles)
Reptile|snake|One of the best known early stem-reptiles is Mesosaurus, a genus from the Early Permian that had returned to water, feeding on fish.
Reptile|snake|A 2021 examination of reptile diversity in the Carboniferous and Permian suggests a much higher degree of diversity than previously thought, comparable or even exceeding that of synapsids
Reptile|snake|"Thus, the ""First Age of Reptiles"" was proposed."
Reptile|snake|It was traditionally assumed that the first reptiles retained an anapsid skull inherited from their ancestors
Reptile|snake|This type of skull has a skull roof with only holes for the nostrils, eyes and a pineal eye
Reptile|snake|"The discoveries of synapsid-like openings (see below) in the skull roof of the skulls of several members of Parareptilia (the clade containing most of the amniotes traditionally referred to as ""anapsids""), including lanthanosuchoids, millerettids, bolosaurids, some nycteroleterids, some procolophonoids and at least some mesosaurs made it more ambiguous and it's currently uncertain whether the ancestral amniote had an anapsid-like or synapsid-like skull"
Reptile|snake|"These animals are traditionally referred to as ""anapsids"", and form a paraphyletic basic stock from which other groups evolved"
Reptile|snake|Very shortly after the first amniotes appeared, a lineage called Synapsida split off; this group was characterized by a temporal opening in the skull behind each eye to give room for the jaw muscle to move
Reptile|snake|"These are the ""mammal-like amniotes"", or stem-mammals, that later gave rise to the true mammals"
Reptile|snake|"Soon after, another group evolved a similar trait, this time with a double opening behind each eye, earning them the name Diapsida (""two arches"")"
Reptile|snake|The function of the holes in these groups was to lighten the skull and give room for the jaw muscles to move, allowing for a more powerful bite.Turtles have been traditionally believed to be surviving parareptiles, on the basis of their anapsid skull structure, which was assumed to be primitive trait
Reptile|snake|The rationale for this classification has been disputed, with some arguing that turtles are diapsids that evolved anapsid skulls in order to improve their armor
Reptile|snake|Later morphological phylogenetic studies with this in mind placed turtles firmly within Diapsida
Reptile|snake|All molecular studies have strongly upheld the placement of turtles within diapsids, most commonly as a sister group to extant archosaurs.
Reptile|snake|With the close of the Carboniferous, the amniotes became the dominant tetrapod fauna
Reptile|snake|While primitive, terrestrial reptiliomorphs still existed, the synapsid amniotes evolved the first truly terrestrial megafauna (giant animals) in the form of pelycosaurs, such as Edaphosaurus and the carnivorous Dimetrodon
Reptile|snake|In the mid-Permian period, the climate became drier, resulting in a change of fauna
Reptile|snake|The pelycosaurs were replaced by the therapsids.The parareptiles, whose massive skull roofs had no postorbital holes, continued and flourished throughout the Permian
Reptile|snake|The pareiasaurian parareptiles reached giant proportions in the late Permian, eventually disappearing at the close of the period (the turtles being possible survivors).Early in the period, the modern reptiles, or crown-group reptiles, evolved and split into two main lineages
Reptile|snake|the Archosauromorpha (forebears of turtles, crocodiles, and dinosaurs) and the Lepidosauromorpha (predecessors of modern lizards and tuataras)
Reptile|snake|Both groups remained lizard-like and relatively small and inconspicuous during the Permian.
Reptile|snake|The close of the Permian saw the greatest mass extinction known (see the Permian–Triassic extinction event), an event prolonged by the combination of two or more distinct extinction pulses
Reptile|snake|Most of the earlier parareptile and synapsid megafauna disappeared, being replaced by the true reptiles, particularly archosauromorphs
Reptile|snake|These were characterized by elongated hind legs and an erect pose, the early forms looking somewhat like long-legged crocodiles
Reptile|snake|The archosaurs became the dominant group during the Triassic period, though it took 30 million years before their diversity was as great as the animals that lived in the Permian
Reptile|snake|Archosaurs developed into the well-known dinosaurs and pterosaurs, as well as the ancestors of crocodiles
Reptile|snake|"Since reptiles, first rauisuchians and then dinosaurs, dominated the Mesozoic era, the interval is popularly known as the ""Age of Reptiles"""
Reptile|snake|The dinosaurs also developed smaller forms, including the feather-bearing smaller theropods
Reptile|snake|In the Cretaceous period, these gave rise to the first true birds.The sister group to Archosauromorpha is Lepidosauromorpha, containing lizards and tuataras, as well as their fossil relatives
Reptile|snake|Lepidosauromorpha contained at least one major group of the Mesozoic sea reptiles
Reptile|snake|the mosasaurs, which lived during the Cretaceous period
Reptile|snake|The phylogenetic placement of other main groups of fossil sea reptiles – the ichthyopterygians (including ichthyosaurs) and the sauropterygians, which evolved in the early Triassic – is more controversial
Reptile|snake|Different authors linked these groups either to lepidosauromorphs or to archosauromorphs, and ichthyopterygians were also argued to be diapsids that did not belong to the least inclusive clade containing lepidosauromorphs and archosauromorphs.
Reptile|snake|The close of the Cretaceous period saw the demise of the Mesozoic era reptilian megafauna (see the Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event, also known as K-T extinction event)
Reptile|snake|Of the large marine reptiles, only sea turtles were left; and of the non-marine large reptiles, only the semi-aquatic crocodiles and broadly similar choristoderes survived the extinction, with last members of the latter, the lizard-like Lazarussuchus, becoming extinct in the Miocene
Reptile|snake|Of the great host of dinosaurs dominating the Mesozoic, only the small beaked birds survived
Reptile|snake|This dramatic extinction pattern at the end of the Mesozoic led into the Cenozoic
Reptile|snake|Mammals and birds filled the empty niches left behind by the reptilian megafauna and, while reptile diversification slowed, bird and mammal diversification took an exponential turn
Reptile|snake|However, reptiles were still important components of the megafauna, particularly in the form of large and giant tortoises.After the extinction of most archosaur and marine reptile lines by the end of the Cretaceous, reptile diversification continued throughout the Cenozoic
Reptile|snake|Squamates took a massive hit during the K–Pg event, only recovering ten million years after it, but they underwent a great radiation event once they recovered, and today squamates make up the majority of living reptiles (> 95%)
Reptile|snake|Approximately 10,000 extant species of traditional reptiles are known, with birds adding about 10,000 more, almost twice the number of mammals, represented by about 5,700 living species (excluding domesticated species).
Reptile|snake|All lepidosaurs and turtles have a three-chambered heart consisting of two atria, one variably partitioned ventricle, and two aortas that lead to the systemic circulation
Reptile|snake|The degree of mixing of oxygenated and deoxygenated blood in the three-chambered heart varies depending on the species and physiological state
Reptile|snake|Under different conditions, deoxygenated blood can be shunted back to the body or oxygenated blood can be shunted back to the lungs
Reptile|snake|This variation in blood flow has been hypothesized to allow more effective thermoregulation and longer diving times for aquatic species, but has not been shown to be a fitness advantage.
Reptile|snake|For example, Iguana hearts, like the majority of the squamates hearts, are composed of three chambers with two aorta and one ventricle, cardiac involuntary muscles
Reptile|snake|The main structures of the heart are the sinus venosus, the pacemaker, the left atrium, the right atrium, the atrioventricular valve, the cavum venosum, cavum arteriosum, the cavum pulmonale, the muscular ridge, the ventricular ridge, pulmonary veins, and paired aortic arches.Some squamate species (e.g., pythons and monitor lizards) have three-chambered hearts that become functionally four-chambered hearts during contraction
Reptile|snake|This is made possible by a muscular ridge that subdivides the ventricle during ventricular diastole and completely divides it during ventricular systole
Reptile|snake|Because of this ridge, some of these squamates are capable of producing ventricular pressure differentials that are equivalent to those seen in mammalian and avian hearts.Crocodilians have an anatomically four-chambered heart, similar to birds, but also have two systemic aortas and are therefore capable of bypassing their pulmonary circulation.
Reptile|snake|Modern non-avian reptiles exhibit some form of cold-bloodedness (i.e
Reptile|snake|some mix of poikilothermy, ectothermy, and bradymetabolism) so that they have limited physiological means of keeping the body temperature constant and often rely on external sources of heat
Reptile|snake|Due to a less stable core temperature than birds and mammals, reptilian biochemistry requires enzymes capable of maintaining efficiency over a greater range of temperatures than in the case for warm-blooded animals
Reptile|snake|The optimum body temperature range varies with species, but is typically below that of warm-blooded animals; for many lizards, it falls in the 24°–35 °C (75°–95 °F) range, while extreme heat-adapted species, like the American desert iguana Dipsosaurus dorsalis, can have optimal physiological temperatures in the mammalian range, between 35° and 40 °C (95° and 104 °F)
Reptile|snake|While the optimum temperature is often encountered when the animal is active, the low basal metabolism makes body temperature drop rapidly when the animal is inactive.
Reptile|snake|As in all animals, reptilian muscle action produces heat
Reptile|snake|In large reptiles, like leatherback turtles, the low surface-to-volume ratio allows this metabolically produced heat to keep the animals warmer than their environment even though they do not have a warm-blooded metabolism
Reptile|snake|This form of homeothermy is called gigantothermy; it has been suggested as having been common in large dinosaurs and other extinct large-bodied reptiles.The benefit of a low resting metabolism is that it requires far less fuel to sustain bodily functions
Reptile|snake|By using temperature variations in their surroundings, or by remaining cold when they do not need to move, reptiles can save considerable amounts of energy compared to endothermic animals of the same size
Reptile|snake|A crocodile needs from a tenth to a fifth of the food necessary for a lion of the same weight and can live half a year without eating
Reptile|snake|Lower food requirements and adaptive metabolisms allow reptiles to dominate the animal life in regions where net calorie availability is too low to sustain large-bodied mammals and birds.
Reptile|snake|It is generally assumed that reptiles are unable to produce the sustained high energy output necessary for long distance chases or flying
Reptile|snake|Higher energetic capacity might have been responsible for the evolution of warm-bloodedness in birds and mammals
Reptile|snake|However, investigation of correlations between active capacity and thermophysiology show a weak relationship
Reptile|snake|Most extant reptiles are carnivores with a sit-and-wait feeding strategy; whether reptiles are cold blooded due to their ecology  is not clear
Reptile|snake|Energetic studies on some reptiles have shown active capacities equal to or greater than similar sized warm-blooded animals.
Reptile|snake|All reptiles breathe using lungs
Reptile|snake|Aquatic turtles have developed more permeable skin, and some species have modified their cloaca to increase the area for gas exchange
Reptile|snake|Even with these adaptations, breathing is never fully accomplished without lungs
Reptile|snake|Lung ventilation is accomplished differently in each main reptile group
Reptile|snake|In squamates, the lungs are ventilated almost exclusively by the axial musculature
Reptile|snake|This is also the same musculature that is used during locomotion
Reptile|snake|Because of this constraint, most squamates are forced to hold their breath during intense runs
Reptile|snake|Some, however, have found a way around it
Reptile|snake|"Varanids, and a few other lizard species, employ buccal pumping as a complement to their normal ""axial breathing"""
Reptile|snake|This allows the animals to completely fill their lungs during intense locomotion, and thus remain aerobically active for a long time
Reptile|snake|Tegu lizards are known to possess a proto-diaphragm, which separates the pulmonary cavity from the visceral cavity
Reptile|snake|While not actually capable of movement, it does allow for greater lung inflation, by taking the weight of the viscera off the lungs.Crocodilians actually have a muscular diaphragm that is analogous to the mammalian diaphragm
Reptile|snake|The difference is that the muscles for the crocodilian diaphragm pull the pubis (part of the pelvis, which is movable in crocodilians) back, which brings the liver down, thus freeing space for the lungs to expand
Reptile|snake|"This type of diaphragmatic setup has been referred to as the ""hepatic piston"""
Reptile|snake|The airways form a number of double tubular chambers within each lung
Reptile|snake|On inhalation and exhalation air moves through the airways in the same direction, thus creating a unidirectional airflow through the lungs
Reptile|snake|A similar system is found in birds, monitor lizards and iguanas.Most reptiles lack a secondary palate, meaning that they must hold their breath while swallowing
Reptile|snake|Crocodilians have evolved a bony secondary palate that allows them to continue breathing while remaining submerged (and protect their brains against damage by struggling prey)
Reptile|snake|Skinks (family Scincidae) also have evolved a bony secondary palate, to varying degrees
Reptile|snake|Snakes took a different approach and extended their trachea instead
Reptile|snake|Their tracheal extension sticks out like a fleshy straw, and allows these animals to swallow large prey without suffering from asphyxiation.
Reptile|snake|How turtles and tortoises breathe has been the subject of much study
Reptile|snake|To date, only a few species have been studied thoroughly enough to get an idea of how those turtles breathe
Reptile|snake|The varied results indicate that turtles and tortoises have found a variety of solutions to this problem.
Reptile|snake|The difficulty is that most turtle shells are rigid and do not allow for the type of expansion and contraction that other amniotes use to ventilate their lungs
Reptile|snake|Some turtles, such as the Indian flapshell (Lissemys punctata), have a sheet of muscle that envelops the lungs
Reptile|snake|When it contracts, the turtle can exhale
Reptile|snake|When at rest, the turtle can retract the limbs into the body cavity and force air out of the lungs
Reptile|snake|When the turtle protracts its limbs, the pressure inside the lungs is reduced, and the turtle can suck air in
Reptile|snake|Turtle lungs are attached to the inside of the top of the shell (carapace), with the bottom of the lungs attached (via connective tissue) to the rest of the viscera
Reptile|snake|By using a series of special muscles (roughly equivalent to a diaphragm), turtles are capable of pushing their viscera up and down, resulting in effective respiration, since many of these muscles have attachment points in conjunction with their forelimbs (indeed, many of the muscles expand into the limb pockets during contraction).Breathing during locomotion has been studied in three species, and they show different patterns
Reptile|snake|Adult female green sea turtles do not breathe as they crutch along their nesting beaches
Reptile|snake|They hold their breath during terrestrial locomotion and breathe in bouts as they rest
Reptile|snake|North American box turtles breathe continuously during locomotion, and the ventilation cycle is not coordinated with the limb movements
Reptile|snake|This is because they use their abdominal muscles to breathe during locomotion
Reptile|snake|The last species to have been studied is the red-eared slider, which also breathes during locomotion, but takes smaller breaths during locomotion than during small pauses between locomotor bouts, indicating that there may be mechanical interference between the limb movements and the breathing apparatus
Reptile|snake|Box turtles have also been observed to breathe while completely sealed up inside their shells.
Reptile|snake|Compared to frogs, birds and mammals, reptiles are less vocal
Reptile|snake|Sound production is usually limited to hissing, which is produced merely by forcing air though a partly closed glottis and is not considered to be a true vocalization
Reptile|snake|The ability to vocalize exists in crocodilians, and some lizards and turtles; and typically involves vibrating fold-like structures in the larynx or glottis
Reptile|snake|Some geckos and turtles possess true vocal cords, which have elastin-rich connective tissue.
Reptile|snake|Reptilian skin is covered in a horny epidermis, making it watertight and enabling reptiles to live on dry land, in contrast to amphibians
Reptile|snake|Compared to mammalian skin, that of reptiles is rather thin and lacks the thick dermal layer that produces leather in mammals.
Reptile|snake|Exposed parts of reptiles are protected by scales or scutes, sometimes with a bony base (osteoderms), forming armor
Reptile|snake|In lepidosaurians, such as lizards and snakes, the whole skin is covered in overlapping epidermal scales
Reptile|snake|Such scales were once thought to be typical of the class Reptilia as a whole, but are now known to occur only in lepidosaurians
Reptile|snake|The scales found in turtles and crocodiles are of dermal, rather than epidermal, origin and are properly termed scutes
Reptile|snake|In turtles, the body is hidden inside a hard shell composed of fused scutes.
Reptile|snake|Lacking a thick dermis, reptilian leather is not as strong as mammalian leather
Reptile|snake|It is used in leather-wares for decorative purposes for shoes, belts and handbags, particularly crocodile skin.
Reptile|snake|Reptiles shed their skin through a process called ecdysis which occurs continuously throughout their lifetime
Reptile|snake|In particular, younger reptiles tend to shed once every 5–6 weeks while adults shed 3–4 times a year
Reptile|snake|Younger reptiles shed more because of their rapid growth rate
Reptile|snake|Once full size, the frequency of shedding drastically decreases
Reptile|snake|The process of ecdysis involves forming a new layer of skin under the old one
Reptile|snake|Proteolytic enzymes and lymphatic fluid is secreted between the old and new layers of skin
Reptile|snake|Consequently, this lifts the old skin from the new one allowing shedding to occur
Reptile|snake|"Snakes will shed from the head to the tail while lizards shed in a ""patchy pattern"""
Reptile|snake|Dysecdysis, a common skin disease in snakes and lizards, will occur when ecdysis, or shedding, fails
Reptile|snake|There are numerous reasons why shedding fails and can be related to inadequate humidity and temperature, nutritional deficiencies, dehydration and traumatic injuries
Reptile|snake|Nutritional deficiencies decrease proteolytic enzymes while dehydration reduces lymphatic fluids to separate the skin layers
Reptile|snake|Traumatic injuries on the other hand, form scars that will not allow new scales to form and disrupt the process of ecdysis.
Reptile|snake|Excretion is performed mainly by two small kidneys
Reptile|snake|In diapsids, uric acid is the main nitrogenous waste product; turtles, like mammals, excrete mainly urea
Reptile|snake|Unlike the kidneys of mammals and birds, reptile kidneys are unable to produce liquid urine more concentrated than their body fluid
Reptile|snake|This is because they lack a specialized structure called a loop of Henle, which is present in the nephrons of birds and mammals
Reptile|snake|Because of this, many reptiles use the colon to aid in the reabsorption of water
Reptile|snake|Some are also able to take up water stored in the bladder
Reptile|snake|Excess salts are also excreted by nasal and lingual salt glands in some reptiles.
Reptile|snake|In all reptiles the urinogenital ducts and the anus both empty into an organ called a cloaca
Reptile|snake|In some reptiles, a midventral wall in the cloaca may open into a urinary bladder, but not all
Reptile|snake|It is present in all turtles and tortoises as well as most lizards, but is lacking in the monitor lizard, the legless lizards
Reptile|snake|It is absent in the snakes, alligators, and crocodiles.Many turtles, tortoises, and lizards have proportionally very large bladders
Reptile|snake|Charles Darwin noted that the Galapagos tortoise had a bladder which could store up to 20% of its body weight
Reptile|snake|Such adaptations are the result of environments such as remote islands and deserts where water is very scarce.
Reptile|snake|143  Other desert-dwelling reptiles have large bladders that can store a long-term reservoir of water for up to several months and aid in osmoregulation.Turtles have two or more accessory urinary bladders, located lateral to the neck of the urinary bladder and dorsal to the pubis, occupying a significant portion of their body cavity
Reptile|snake|Their bladder is also usually bilobed with a left and right section
Reptile|snake|The right section is located under the liver, which prevents large stones from remaining in that side while the left section is more likely to have calculi.
Reptile|snake|Most reptiles are insectivorous or carnivorous and have simple and comparatively short digestive tracts due to meat being fairly simple to break down and digest
Reptile|snake|Digestion is slower than in mammals, reflecting their lower resting metabolism and their inability to divide and masticate their food
Reptile|snake|Their poikilotherm metabolism has very low energy requirements, allowing large reptiles like crocodiles and large constrictors to live from a single large meal for months, digesting it slowly.While modern reptiles are predominantly carnivorous, during the early history of reptiles several groups produced some herbivorous megafauna
Reptile|snake|in the Paleozoic, the pareiasaurs; and in the Mesozoic several lines of dinosaurs
Reptile|snake|Today, turtles are the only predominantly herbivorous reptile group, but several lines of agamas and iguanas have evolved to live wholly or partly on plants.Herbivorous reptiles face the same problems of mastication as herbivorous mammals but, lacking the complex teeth of mammals, many species swallow rocks and pebbles (so called gastroliths) to aid in digestion
Reptile|snake|The rocks are washed around in the stomach, helping to grind up plant matter
Reptile|snake|Fossil gastroliths have been found associated with both ornithopods and sauropods, though whether they actually functioned as a gastric mill in the latter is disputed
Reptile|snake|Salt water crocodiles also use gastroliths as ballast, stabilizing them in the water or helping them to dive
Reptile|snake|A dual function as both stabilizing ballast and digestion aid has been suggested for gastroliths found in plesiosaurs.
Reptile|snake|The reptilian nervous system contains the same basic part of the amphibian brain, but the reptile cerebrum and cerebellum are slightly larger
Reptile|snake|Most typical sense organs are well developed with certain exceptions, most notably the snake's lack of external ears (middle and inner ears are present)
Reptile|snake|There are twelve pairs of cranial nerves
Reptile|snake|Due to their short cochlea, reptiles use electrical tuning to expand their range of audible frequencies.
Reptile|snake|Reptiles are generally considered less intelligent than mammals and birds
Reptile|snake|The size of their brain relative to their body is much less than that of mammals, the encephalization quotient being about one tenth of that of mammals, though larger reptiles can show more complex brain development
Reptile|snake|Larger lizards, like the monitors, are known to exhibit complex behavior, including cooperation and cognitive abilities allowing them to optimize their foraging and territoriality over time
Reptile|snake|Crocodiles have relatively larger brains and show a fairly complex social structure
Reptile|snake|The Komodo dragon is even known to engage in play, as are turtles, which are also considered to be social creatures, and sometimes switch between monogamy and promiscuity in their sexual behavior
Reptile|snake|One study found that wood turtles were better than white rats at learning to navigate mazes
Reptile|snake|Another study found that giant tortoises are capable of learning through operant conditioning, visual discrimination and retained learned behaviors with long-term memory
Reptile|snake|Sea turtles have been regarded as having simple brains, but their flippers are used for a variety of foraging tasks (holding, bracing, corralling) in common with marine mammals.
Reptile|snake|Most reptiles are diurnal animals
Reptile|snake|The vision is typically adapted to daylight conditions, with color vision and more advanced visual depth perception than in amphibians and most mammals.
Reptile|snake|Reptiles usually have excellent vision, allowing them to detect shapes and motions at long distances
Reptile|snake|They often have only a few Rod cells and have poor vision in low-light conditions
Reptile|snake|"At the same time they have cells called ""double cones"" which give them sharp color vision and enable them to see ultraviolet wavelengths"
Reptile|snake|In some species, such as blind snakes, vision is reduced.
Reptile|snake|Many lepidosaurs have a photosensory organ on the top of their heads called the parietal eye, which are also called third eye, pineal eye or pineal gland
Reptile|snake|"This ""eye"" does not work the same way as a normal eye does as it has only a rudimentary retina and lens and thus, cannot form images"
Reptile|snake|It is however sensitive to changes in light and dark and can detect movement.Some snakes have extra sets of visual organs (in the loosest sense of the word) in the form of pits sensitive to infrared radiation (heat)
Reptile|snake|Such heat-sensitive pits are particularly well developed in the pit vipers, but are also found in boas and pythons
Reptile|snake|These pits allow the snakes to sense the body heat of birds and mammals, enabling pit vipers to hunt rodents in the dark.Most reptiles including birds possess a nictitating membrane, a translucent third eyelid which is drawn over the eye from the inner corner
Reptile|snake|Notably, it protects a crocodilian's eyeball surface while allowing a degree of vision underwater
Reptile|snake|However, many squamates, geckos and snakes in particular, lack eyelids, which are replaced by a transparent scale
Reptile|snake|This is called the brille, spectacle, or eyecap
Reptile|snake|The brille is usually not visible, except for when the snake molts, and it protects the eyes from dust and dirt.
Reptile|snake|Reptiles generally reproduce sexually, though some are capable of asexual reproduction
Reptile|snake|All reproductive activity occurs through the cloaca, the single exit/entrance at the base of the tail where waste is also eliminated
Reptile|snake|Most reptiles have copulatory organs, which are usually retracted or inverted and stored inside the body
Reptile|snake|In turtles and crocodilians, the male has a single median penis, while squamates, including snakes and lizards, possess a pair of hemipenes, only one of which is typically used in each session
Reptile|snake|Tuatara, however, lack copulatory organs, and so the male and female simply press their cloacas together as the male discharges sperm.Most reptiles lay amniotic eggs covered with leathery or calcareous shells
Reptile|snake|An amnion, chorion, and allantois are present during embryonic life
Reptile|snake|The eggshell (1) protects the crocodile embryo (11) and keeps it from drying out, but it is flexible to allow gas exchange
Reptile|snake|The chorion (6) aids in gas exchange between the inside and outside of the egg
Reptile|snake|It allows carbon dioxide to exit the egg and oxygen gas to enter the egg
Reptile|snake|The albumin (9) further protects the embryo and serves as a reservoir for water and protein
Reptile|snake|The allantois (8) is a sac that collects the metabolic waste produced by the embryo
Reptile|snake|The amniotic sac (10) contains amniotic fluid (12) which protects and cushions the embryo
Reptile|snake|The amnion (5) aids in osmoregulation and serves as a saltwater reservoir
Reptile|snake|The yolk sac (2) surrounding the yolk (3) contains protein and fat rich nutrients that are absorbed by the embryo via vessels (4) that allow the embryo to grow and metabolize
Reptile|snake|The air space (7) provides the embryo with oxygen while it is hatching
Reptile|snake|This ensures that the embryo will not suffocate while it is hatching
Reptile|snake|There are no larval stages of development
Reptile|snake|Viviparity and ovoviviparity have evolved in many extinct clades of reptiles and in squamates
Reptile|snake|In the latter group, many species, including all boas and most vipers, utilize this mode of reproduction
Reptile|snake|The degree of viviparity varies; some species simply retain the eggs until just before hatching, others provide maternal nourishment to supplement the yolk, and yet others lack any yolk and provide all nutrients via a structure similar to the mammalian placenta
Reptile|snake|The earliest documented case of viviparity in reptiles is the Early Permian mesosaurs, although some individuals or taxa in that clade may also have been oviparous because a putative isolated egg has also been found
Reptile|snake|Several groups of Mesozoic marine reptiles also exhibited viviparity, such as mosasaurs, ichthyosaurs, and Sauropterygia, a group that include pachypleurosaurs and Plesiosauria.Asexual reproduction has been identified in squamates in six families of lizards and one snake
Reptile|snake|In some species of squamates, a population of females is able to produce a unisexual diploid clone of the mother
Reptile|snake|This form of asexual reproduction, called parthenogenesis, occurs in several species of gecko, and is particularly widespread in the teiids (especially Aspidocelis) and lacertids (Lacerta)
Reptile|snake|In captivity, Komodo dragons (Varanidae) have reproduced by parthenogenesis.
Reptile|snake|Some reptiles exhibit temperature-dependent sex determination (TDSD), in which the incubation temperature determines whether a particular egg hatches as male or female
Reptile|snake|TDSD is most common in turtles and crocodiles, but also occurs in lizards and tuatara
Reptile|snake|To date, there has been no confirmation of whether TDSD occurs in snakes.
Reptile|snake|Many small reptiles, such as snakes and lizards that live on the ground or in the water, are vulnerable to being preyed on by all kinds of carnivorous animals
Reptile|snake|Thus avoidance is the most common form of defense in reptiles
Reptile|snake|At the first sign of danger, most snakes and lizards crawl away into the undergrowth, and turtles and crocodiles will plunge into water and sink out of sight.
Reptile|snake|Reptiles tend to avoid confrontation through camouflage
Reptile|snake|Two major groups of reptile predators are birds and other reptiles, both of which have well developed color vision
Reptile|snake|Thus the skins of many reptiles have cryptic coloration of plain or mottled gray, green, and brown to allow them to blend into the background of their natural environment
Reptile|snake|Aided by the reptiles' capacity for remaining motionless for long periods, the camouflage of many snakes is so effective that people or domestic animals are most typically bitten because they accidentally step on them.When camouflage fails to protect them, blue-tongued skinks will try to ward off attackers by displaying their blue tongues, and the frill-necked lizard will display its brightly colored frill
Reptile|snake|These same displays are used in territorial disputes and during courtship
Reptile|snake|If danger arises so suddenly that flight is useless, crocodiles, turtles, some lizards, and some snakes hiss loudly when confronted by an enemy
Reptile|snake|Rattlesnakes rapidly vibrate the tip of the tail, which is composed of a series of nested, hollow beads to ward off approaching danger.
Reptile|snake|In contrast to the normal drab coloration of most reptiles, the lizards of the genus Heloderma (the Gila monster and the beaded lizard) and many of the coral snakes have high-contrast warning coloration, warning potential predators they are venomous
Reptile|snake|A number of non-venomous North American snake species have colorful markings similar to those of the coral snake, an oft cited example of Batesian mimicry.
Reptile|snake|Camouflage does not always fool a predator
Reptile|snake|When caught out, snake species adopt different defensive tactics and use a complicated set of behaviors when attacked
Reptile|snake|Some first elevate their head and spread out the skin of their neck in an effort to look large and threatening
Reptile|snake|Failure of this strategy may lead to other measures practiced particularly by cobras, vipers, and closely related species, which use venom to attack
Reptile|snake|The venom is modified saliva, delivered through fangs from a venom gland
Reptile|snake|Some non-venomous snakes, such as American hognose snakes or European grass snake, play dead when in danger; some, including the grass snake, exude a foul-smelling liquid to deter attackers.
Reptile|snake|When a crocodilian is concerned about its safety, it will gape to expose the teeth and yellow tongue
Reptile|snake|If this doesn't work, the crocodilian gets a little more agitated and typically begins to make hissing sounds
Reptile|snake|After this, the crocodilian will start to change its posture dramatically to make itself look more intimidating
Reptile|snake|The body is inflated to increase apparent size
Reptile|snake|If absolutely necessary it may decide to attack an enemy.
Reptile|snake|Some species try to bite immediately
Reptile|snake|Some will use their heads as sledgehammers and literally smash an opponent, some will rush or swim toward the threat from a distance, even chasing the opponent onto land or galloping after it
Reptile|snake|The main weapon in all crocodiles is the bite, which can generate very high bite force
Reptile|snake|Many species also possess canine-like teeth
Reptile|snake|These are used primarily for seizing prey, but are also used in fighting and display.
Reptile|snake|Geckos, skinks, and other lizards that are captured by the tail will shed part of the tail structure through a process called autotomy and thus be able to flee
Reptile|snake|The detached tail will continue to wiggle, creating a deceptive sense of continued struggle and distracting the predator's attention from the fleeing prey animal
Reptile|snake|The detached tails of leopard geckos can wiggle for up to 20 minutes
Reptile|snake|In many species the tails are of a separate and dramatically more intense color than the rest of the body so as to encourage potential predators to strike for the tail first
Reptile|snake|In the shingleback skink and some species of geckos, the tail is short and broad and resembles the head, so that the predators may attack it rather than the more vulnerable front part.Reptiles that are capable of shedding their tails can partially regenerate them over a period of weeks
Reptile|snake|The new section will however contain cartilage rather than bone, and will never grow to the same length as the original tail
Reptile|snake|It is often also distinctly discolored compared to the rest of the body and may lack some of the external sculpting features seen in the original tail.
Reptile|snake|Dinosaurs have been widely depicted in culture since the English palaeontologist Richard Owen coined the name dinosaur in 1842
Reptile|snake|As soon as 1854, the Crystal Palace Dinosaurs were on display to the public in south London
Reptile|snake|One dinosaur appeared in literature even earlier, as Charles Dickens placed a Megalosaurus in the first chapter of his novel Bleak House in 1852
Reptile|snake|The dinosaurs featured in books, films, television programs, artwork, and other media have been used for both education and entertainment
Reptile|snake|The depictions range from the realistic, as in the television documentaries of the 1990s and first decade of the 21st century, or the fantastic, as in the monster movies of the 1950s and 1960s.The snake or serpent has played a powerful symbolic role in different cultures
Reptile|snake|In Egyptian history, the Nile cobra adorned the crown of the pharaoh
Reptile|snake|It was worshipped as one of the gods and was also used for sinister purposes
Reptile|snake|murder of an adversary and ritual suicide (Cleopatra)
Reptile|snake|In Greek mythology snakes are associated with deadly antagonists, as a chthonic symbol, roughly translated as earthbound
Reptile|snake|The nine-headed Lernaean Hydra that Hercules defeated and the three Gorgon sisters are children of Gaia, the earth
Reptile|snake|Medusa was one of the three Gorgon sisters who Perseus defeated
Reptile|snake|Medusa is described as a hideous mortal, with snakes instead of hair and the power to turn men to stone with her gaze
Reptile|snake|After killing her, Perseus gave her head to Athena who fixed it to her shield called the Aegis
Reptile|snake|The Titans are depicted in art with their legs replaced by bodies of snakes for the same reason
Reptile|snake|They are children of Gaia, so they are bound to the earth
Reptile|snake|In Hinduism, snakes are worshipped as gods, with many women pouring milk on snake pits
Reptile|snake|The cobra is seen on the neck of Shiva, while Vishnu is depicted often as sleeping on a seven-headed snake or within the coils of a serpent
Reptile|snake|There are temples in India solely for cobras sometimes called Nagraj (King of Snakes), and it is believed that snakes are symbols of fertility
Reptile|snake|In the annual Hindu festival of Nag Panchami, snakes are venerated and prayed to
Reptile|snake|In religious terms, the snake and jaguar are arguably the most important animals in ancient Mesoamerica
Reptile|snake|"""In states of ecstasy, lords dance a serpent dance; great descending snakes adorn and support buildings from Chichen Itza to Tenochtitlan, and the Nahuatl word coatl meaning serpent or twin, forms part of primary deities such as Mixcoatl, Quetzalcoatl, and Coatlicue."" In Christianity and Judaism, a serpent appears in Genesis to tempt Adam and Eve with the forbidden fruit from the Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil.The turtle has a prominent position as a symbol of steadfastness and tranquility in religion, mythology, and folklore from around the world"
Reptile|snake|A tortoise's longevity is suggested by its long lifespan and its shell, which was thought to protect it from any foe
Reptile|snake|In the cosmological myths of several cultures a World Turtle carries the world upon its back or supports the heavens.
Reptile|snake|Deaths from snakebites are uncommon in many parts of the world, but are still counted in tens of thousands per year in India
Reptile|snake|Snakebite can be treated with antivenom made from the venom of the snake
Reptile|snake|To produce antivenom, a mixture of the venoms of different species of snake is injected into the body of a horse in ever-increasing dosages until the horse is immunized
Reptile|snake|Blood is then extracted; the serum is separated, purified and freeze-dried
Reptile|snake|The cytotoxic effect of snake venom is being researched as a potential treatment for cancers.Lizards such as the Gila monster produce toxins with medical applications
Reptile|snake|Gila toxin reduces plasma glucose; the substance is now synthesised for use in the anti-diabetes drug exenatide (Byetta)
Reptile|snake|Another toxin from Gila monster saliva has been studied for use as an anti-Alzheimer's drug.Geckos have also been used as medicine, especially in China
Reptile|snake|Turtles have been used in Chinese traditional medicine for thousands of years, with every part of the turtle believed to have medical benefits
Reptile|snake|There is a lack of scientific evidence that would correlate claimed medical benefits to turtle consumption
Reptile|snake|Growing demand for turtle meat has placed pressure on vulnerable wild populations of turtles.
Reptile|snake|Crocodiles are protected in many parts of the world, and are farmed commercially
Reptile|snake|Their hides are tanned and used to make leather goods such as shoes and handbags; crocodile meat is also considered a delicacy
Reptile|snake|The most commonly farmed species are the saltwater and Nile crocodiles
Reptile|snake|Farming has resulted in an increase in the saltwater crocodile population in Australia, as eggs are usually harvested from the wild, so landowners have an incentive to conserve their habitat
Reptile|snake|Crocodile leather is made into wallets, briefcases, purses, handbags, belts, hats, and shoes
Reptile|snake|Crocodile oil has been used for various purposes.Snakes are also farmed, primarily in East and Southeast Asia, and their production has become more intensive in the last decade
Reptile|snake|Snake farming has been troubling for conservation in the past as it can lead to overexploitation of wild snakes and their natural prey to supply the farms
Reptile|snake|However,  farming snakes can limit the hunting of wild snakes, while reducing the slaughter of higher-order vertebrates like cows
Reptile|snake|The energy efficiency of snakes is higher than expected for carnivores, due to their ectothermy and low metabolism
Reptile|snake|Waste protein from the poultry and pig industries is used as feed in snake farms
Reptile|snake|Snake farms produce meat, snake skin, and antivenom.
Reptile|snake|Turtle farming is another known but controversial practice
Reptile|snake|Turtles have been farmed for a variety of reasons, ranging from food to traditional medicine, the pet trade, and scientific conservation
Reptile|snake|Demand for turtle meat and medicinal products is one of the main threats to turtle conservation in Asia
Reptile|snake|Though commercial breeding would seem to insulate wild populations, it can stoke the demand for them and increase wild captures
Reptile|snake|Even the potentially appealing concept of raising turtles at a farm to release into the wild is questioned by some veterinarians who have had some experience with farm operations
Reptile|snake|They caution that this may introduce into the wild populations infectious diseases that occur on the farm, but have not (yet) been occurring in the wild.
Reptile|snake|In the Western world, some snakes (especially docile species such as the ball python and corn snake) are kept as pets
Reptile|snake|Numerous species of lizard are kept as pets, including bearded dragons, iguanas, anoles, and geckos (such as the popular leopard gecko and the crested gecko).Turtles and tortoises are an increasingly popular pet, but keeping them can be challenging due to particular requirements, such as temperature control and a varied diet, as well as the long lifespans of turtles, who can potentially outlive their owners
Reptile|snake|Good hygiene and significant maintenance is necessary when keeping reptiles, due to the risks of Salmonella and other pathogens.A herpetarium is a zoological exhibition space for reptiles or amphibians.

Sheep|sheep|Sheep (Ovis aries) are quadrupedal, ruminant mammals typically kept as livestock
Sheep|sheep|Like all ruminants, sheep are members of the order Artiodactyla, the even-toed ungulates
Sheep|sheep|Although the name sheep applies to many species in the genus Ovis, in everyday usage it almost always refers to Ovis aries
Sheep|sheep|Numbering a little over one billion, domestic sheep are also the most numerous species of sheep
Sheep|sheep|An adult female is referred to as a ewe (), an intact male as a ram, occasionally a tup, a castrated male as a wether, and a young sheep as a lamb.
Sheep|sheep|Sheep are most likely descended from the wild mouflon of Europe and Asia, with Iran being a geographic envelope of the domestication center
Sheep|sheep|One of the earliest animals to be domesticated for agricultural purposes, sheep are raised for fleeces, meat (lamb, hogget or mutton) and milk
Sheep|sheep|A sheep's wool is the most widely used animal fiber, and is usually harvested by shearing
Sheep|sheep|Ovine meat is called lamb when from younger animals and mutton when from older ones in Commonwealth countries, and lamb in the United States (including from adults)
Sheep|sheep|Sheep continue to be important for wool and meat today, and are also occasionally raised for pelts, as dairy animals, or as model organisms for science.
Sheep|sheep|Sheep husbandry is practised throughout the majority of the inhabited world, and has been fundamental to many civilizations
Sheep|sheep|In the modern era, Australia, New Zealand, the southern and central South American nations, and the British Isles are most closely associated with sheep production.
Sheep|sheep|There is a large lexicon of unique terms for sheep husbandry which vary considerably by region and dialect
Sheep|sheep|Use of the word sheep began in Middle English as a derivation of the Old English word scēap; it is both the singular and plural name for the animal
Sheep|sheep|A group of sheep is called a flock
Sheep|sheep|Many other specific terms for the various life stages of sheep exist, generally related to lambing, shearing, and age.
Sheep|sheep|Being a key animal in the history of farming, sheep have a deeply entrenched place in human culture, and find representation in much modern language and symbology
Sheep|sheep|As livestock, sheep are most often associated with pastoral, Arcadian imagery
Sheep|sheep|Sheep figure in many mythologies—such as the Golden Fleece—and major religions, especially the Abrahamic traditions
Sheep|sheep|In both ancient and modern religious ritual, sheep are used as sacrificial animals.
Sheep|sheep|The exact line of descent between domestic sheep and their wild ancestors is unclear
Sheep|sheep|The most common hypothesis states that Ovis aries is descended from the Asiatic (O
Sheep|sheep|gmelini) species of mouflon; the European mouflon (Ovis aries musimon) is a direct descendant of this popuation
Sheep|sheep|Sheep were among the first animals to be domesticated by humankind (although the domestication of dogs may have taken place more than 20,000 years earlier); the domestication date is estimated to fall between 11,000 and 9,000 B.C in Mesopotamia and possibly around 7,000 B.C
Sheep|sheep|in Mehrgarh in the Indus Valley
Sheep|sheep|The rearing of sheep for secondary products, and the resulting breed development, began in either southwest Asia or western Europe
Sheep|sheep|Initially, sheep were kept solely for meat, milk and skins
Sheep|sheep|Archaeological evidence from statuary found at sites in Iran suggests that selection for woolly sheep may have begun around 6000 BC, and the earliest woven wool garments have been dated to two to three thousand years later.Sheep husbandry spread quickly in  Europe
Sheep|sheep|Excavations show that in about 6000 BC, during the Neolithic period of prehistory, the Castelnovien people, living around Châteauneuf-les-Martigues near present-day Marseille in the south of France, were among the first in Europe to keep domestic sheep
Sheep|sheep|Practically from its inception, ancient Greek civilization relied on sheep as primary livestock, and were even said to name individual animals
Sheep|sheep|Ancient Romans kept sheep on a wide scale, and were an important agent in the spread of sheep raising
Sheep|sheep|Pliny the Elder, in his Natural History (Naturalis Historia), speaks at length about sheep and wool
Sheep|sheep|European colonists spread the practice to the New World from 1493 onwards.
Sheep|sheep|Domestic sheep are relatively small ruminants, usually with a crimped hair called wool and often with horns forming a lateral spiral
Sheep|sheep|Domestic sheep differ from their wild relatives and ancestors in several respects, having become uniquely neotenic as a result of selective breeding by humans
Sheep|sheep|A few primitive breeds of sheep retain some of the characteristics of their wild cousins, such as short tails
Sheep|sheep|Depending on breed, domestic sheep may have no horns at all (i.e
Sheep|sheep|polled), or horns in both sexes, or in males only
Sheep|sheep|Most horned breeds have a single pair, but a few breeds may have several.
Sheep|sheep|Another trait unique to domestic sheep as compared to wild ovines is their wide variation in color
Sheep|sheep|Wild sheep are largely variations of brown hues, and variation within species is extremely limited
Sheep|sheep|Colors of domestic sheep range from pure white to dark chocolate brown, and even spotted or piebald
Sheep|sheep|Selection for easily dyeable white fleeces began early in sheep domestication, and as white wool is a dominant trait it spread quickly
Sheep|sheep|However, colored sheep do appear in many modern breeds, and may even appear as a recessive trait in white flocks
Sheep|sheep|While white wool is desirable for large commercial markets, there is a niche market for colored fleeces, mostly for handspinning
Sheep|sheep|The nature of the fleece varies widely among the breeds, from dense and highly crimped, to long and hairlike
Sheep|sheep|There is variation of wool type and quality even among members of the same flock, so wool classing is a step in the commercial processing of the fibre.
Sheep|sheep|Depending on breed, sheep show a range of heights and weights
Sheep|sheep|Their rate of growth and mature weight is a heritable trait that is often selected for in breeding
Sheep|sheep|Ewes typically weigh between 45 and 100 kilograms (100 and 220 lb), and rams between 45 and 160 kilograms (100 and 350 lb)
Sheep|sheep|When all deciduous teeth have erupted, the sheep has 20 teeth
Sheep|sheep|Mature sheep have 32 teeth
Sheep|sheep|As with other ruminants, the front teeth in the lower jaw bite against a hard, toothless pad in the upper jaw
Sheep|sheep|These are used to pick off vegetation, then the rear teeth grind it before it is swallowed
Sheep|sheep|There are eight lower front teeth in ruminants, but there is some disagreement as to whether these are eight incisors, or six incisors and two incisor-shaped canines
Sheep|sheep|This means that the dental formula for sheep is either 0.0.3.34.0.3.3 or 0.0.3.33.1.3.3  There is a large diastema between the incisors and the molars.
Sheep|sheep|In the first few years of life one can calculate the age of sheep from their front teeth, as a pair of milk teeth is replaced by larger adult teeth each year, the full set of eight adult front teeth being complete at about four years of age
Sheep|sheep|The front teeth are then gradually lost as sheep age, making it harder for them to feed and hindering the health and productivity of the animal
Sheep|sheep|For this reason, domestic sheep on normal pasture begin to slowly decline from four years on, and the life expectancy of a sheep is 10 to 12 years, though some sheep may live as long as 20 years
Sheep|sheep|Sheep have good hearing, and are sensitive to noise when being handled
Sheep|sheep|Sheep have horizontal slit-shaped pupils, with excellent peripheral vision; with visual fields of about 270° to 320°, sheep can see behind themselves without turning their heads
Sheep|sheep|Many breeds have only short hair on the face, and some have facial wool (if any) confined to the poll and or the area of the mandibular angle; the wide angles of peripheral vision apply to these breeds
Sheep|sheep|"A few breeds tend to have considerable wool on the face; for some individuals of these breeds, peripheral vision may be greatly reduced by ""wool blindness"", unless recently shorn about the face"
Sheep|sheep|Sheep have poor depth perception; shadows and dips in the ground may cause sheep to baulk
Sheep|sheep|In general, sheep have a tendency to move out of the dark and into well-lit areas, and prefer to move uphill when disturbed
Sheep|sheep|Sheep also have an excellent sense of smell, and, like all species of their genus, have scent glands just in front of the eyes, and interdigitally on the feet
Sheep|sheep|The purpose of these glands is uncertain, but those on the face may be used in breeding behaviors
Sheep|sheep|The foot glands might also be related to reproduction, but alternative functions, such as secretion of a waste product or a scent marker to help lost sheep find their flock, have also been proposed.
Sheep|sheep|Sheep and goats are closely related
Sheep|sheep|both are in the subfamily Caprinae
Sheep|sheep|However, they are separate species, so hybrids rarely occur and are always infertile
Sheep|sheep|A hybrid of a ewe and a buck (a male goat) is called a sheep-goat hybrid, and is not to be confused with the sheep-goat chimera, though both are known as geep
Sheep|sheep|Visual differences between sheep and goats include the beard of goats and divided upper lip of sheep
Sheep|sheep|Sheep tails also hang down, even when short or docked, while the short tails of goats are held upwards
Sheep|sheep|Also, sheep breeds are often naturally polled (either in both sexes or just in the female), while naturally polled goats are rare (though many are polled artificially)
Sheep|sheep|Males of the two species differ in that buck goats acquire a unique and strong odor during the rut, whereas rams do not.
Sheep|sheep|The domestic sheep is a multi-purpose animal, and the more than 200 breeds now in existence were created to serve these diverse purposes
Sheep|sheep|Some sources give a count of a thousand or more breeds, but these numbers cannot be verified, according to some sources
Sheep|sheep|However, several hundred breeds of sheep have been identified by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the UN (FAO), with the estimated number varying somewhat from time to time
Sheep|sheep|e.g
Sheep|sheep|863 breeds as of 1993, 1314 breeds as of 1995 and 1229 breeds as of 2006
Sheep|sheep|"(These numbers exclude extinct breeds, which are also tallied by the FAO.) For the purpose of such tallies, the FAO definition of a breed is ""either a subspecific group of domestic livestock with definable and identifiable external characteristics that enable it to be separated by visual appraisal from other similarly defined groups within the same species or a group for which geographical and/or cultural separation from phenotypically similar groups has led to acceptance of its separate identity."" Almost all sheep are classified as being best suited to furnishing a certain product"
Sheep|sheep|wool, meat, milk, hides, or a combination in a dual-purpose breed
Sheep|sheep|Other features used when classifying sheep include face color (generally white or black), tail length, presence or lack of horns, and the topography for which the breed has been developed
Sheep|sheep|This last point is especially stressed in the UK, where breeds are described as either upland (hill or mountain) or lowland breeds
Sheep|sheep|A sheep may also be of a fat-tailed type, which is a dual-purpose sheep common in Africa and Asia with larger deposits of fat within and around its tail.
Sheep|sheep|Breeds are often categorized by the type of their wool
Sheep|sheep|Fine wool breeds are those that have wool of great crimp and density, which are preferred for textiles
Sheep|sheep|Most of these were derived from Merino sheep, and the breed continues to dominate the world sheep industry
Sheep|sheep|Downs breeds have wool between the extremes, and are typically fast-growing meat and ram breeds with dark faces
Sheep|sheep|Some major medium wool breeds, such as the Corriedale, are dual-purpose crosses of long and fine-wooled breeds and were created for high-production commercial flocks
Sheep|sheep|Long wool breeds are the largest of sheep, with long wool and a slow rate of growth
Sheep|sheep|Long wool sheep are most valued for crossbreeding to improve the attributes of other sheep types
Sheep|sheep|For example
Sheep|sheep|the American Columbia breed was developed by crossing Lincoln rams (a long wool breed) with fine-wooled Rambouillet ewes.
Sheep|sheep|Coarse or carpet wool sheep are those with a medium to long length wool of characteristic coarseness
Sheep|sheep|Breeds traditionally used for carpet wool show great variability, but the chief requirement is a wool that will not break down under heavy use (as would that of the finer breeds)
Sheep|sheep|As the demand for carpet-quality wool declines, some breeders of this type of sheep are attempting to use a few of these traditional breeds for alternative purposes
Sheep|sheep|Others have always been primarily meat-class sheep.
Sheep|sheep|A minor class of sheep are the dairy breeds
Sheep|sheep|Dual-purpose breeds that may primarily be meat or wool sheep are often used secondarily as milking animals, but there are a few breeds that are predominantly used for milking
Sheep|sheep|These sheep produce a higher quantity of milk and have slightly longer lactation curves
Sheep|sheep|In the quality of their milk, the fat and protein content percentages of dairy sheep vary from non-dairy breeds, but lactose content does not.A last group of sheep breeds is that of fur or hair sheep, which do not grow wool at all
Sheep|sheep|Hair sheep are similar to the early domesticated sheep kept before woolly breeds were developed, and are raised for meat and pelts
Sheep|sheep|Some modern breeds of hair sheep, such as the Dorper, result from crosses between wool and hair breeds
Sheep|sheep|For meat and hide producers, hair sheep are cheaper to keep, as they do not need shearing
Sheep|sheep|Hair sheep are also more resistant to parasites and hot weather.With the modern rise of corporate agribusiness and the decline of localized family farms, many breeds of sheep are in danger of extinction
Sheep|sheep|"The Rare Breeds Survival Trust of the UK lists 22 native breeds as having only 3,000 registered animals (each), and The Livestock Conservancy lists 14 as either ""critical"" or ""threatened"""
Sheep|sheep|Preferences for breeds with uniform characteristics and fast growth have pushed heritage (or heirloom) breeds to the margins of the sheep industry
Sheep|sheep|Those that remain are maintained through the efforts of conservation organizations, breed registries, and individual farmers dedicated to their preservation.
Sheep|sheep|Sheep are herbivorous mammals
Sheep|sheep|Most breeds prefer to graze on grass and other short roughage, avoiding the taller woody parts of plants that goats readily consume
Sheep|sheep|Both sheep and goats use their lips and tongues to select parts of the plant that are easier to digest or higher in nutrition
Sheep|sheep|Sheep, however, graze well in monoculture pastures where most goats fare poorly.
Sheep|sheep|Like all ruminants, sheep have a complex digestive system composed of four chambers, allowing them to break down cellulose from stems, leaves, and seed hulls into simpler carbohydrates
Sheep|sheep|When sheep graze, vegetation is chewed into a mass called a bolus, which is then passed into the rumen, via the reticulum
Sheep|sheep|The rumen is a 19- to 38-liter (5 to 10 gallon) organ in which feed is fermented
Sheep|sheep|The fermenting organisms include bacteria, fungi, and protozoa
Sheep|sheep|(Other important rumen organisms include some archaea, which produce methane from carbon dioxide.) The bolus is periodically regurgitated back to the mouth as cud for additional chewing and salivation
Sheep|sheep|After fermentation in the rumen, feed passes into the reticulum and the omasum; special feeds such as grains may bypass the rumen altogether
Sheep|sheep|After the first three chambers, food moves into the abomasum for final digestion before processing by the intestines
Sheep|sheep|"The abomasum is the only one of the four chambers analogous to the human stomach, and is sometimes called the ""true stomach"".Other than forage, the other staple feed for sheep is hay, often during the winter months"
Sheep|sheep|The ability to thrive solely on pasture (even without hay) varies with breed, but all sheep can survive on this diet
Sheep|sheep|Also included in some sheep's diets are minerals, either in a trace mix or in licks
Sheep|sheep|Feed provided to sheep must be specially formulated, as most cattle, poultry, pig, and even some goat feeds contain levels of copper that are lethal to sheep
Sheep|sheep|The same danger applies to mineral supplements such as salt licks.
Sheep|sheep|Sheep follow a diurnal pattern of activity, feeding from dawn to dusk, stopping sporadically to rest and chew their cud
Sheep|sheep|Ideal pasture for sheep is not lawnlike grass, but an array of grasses, legumes and forbs
Sheep|sheep|Types of land where sheep are raised vary widely, from pastures that are seeded and improved intentionally to rough, native lands
Sheep|sheep|Common plants toxic to sheep are present in most of the world, and include (but are not limited to) cherry, some oaks and acorns, tomato, yew, rhubarb, potato, and rhododendron.
Sheep|sheep|Sheep are largely grazing herbivores, unlike browsing animals such as goats and deer that prefer taller foliage
Sheep|sheep|With a much narrower face, sheep crop plants very close to the ground and can overgraze a pasture much faster than cattle
Sheep|sheep|For this reason, many shepherds use managed intensive rotational grazing, where a flock is rotated through multiple pastures, giving plants time to recover
Sheep|sheep|Paradoxically, sheep can both cause and solve the spread of invasive plant species
Sheep|sheep|By disturbing the natural state of pasture, sheep and other livestock can pave the way for invasive plants
Sheep|sheep|However, sheep also prefer to eat invasives such as cheatgrass, leafy spurge, kudzu and spotted knapweed over native species such as sagebrush, making grazing sheep effective for conservation grazing
Sheep|sheep|Research conducted in Imperial County, California compared lamb grazing with herbicides for weed control in seedling alfalfa fields
Sheep|sheep|Three trials demonstrated that grazing lambs were just as effective as herbicides in controlling winter weeds
Sheep|sheep|Entomologists also compared grazing lambs to insecticides for insect control in winter alfalfa
Sheep|sheep|In this trial, lambs provided insect control as effectively as insecticides.
Sheep|sheep|Sheep are flock animals and strongly gregarious; much sheep behavior can be understood on the basis of these tendencies
Sheep|sheep|The dominance hierarchy of sheep and their natural inclination to follow a leader to new pastures were the pivotal factors in sheep being one of the first domesticated livestock species
Sheep|sheep|Furthermore, in contrast to the red deer and gazelle (two other ungulates of primary importance to meat production in prehistoric times), sheep do not defend territories although they do form home ranges
Sheep|sheep|All sheep have a tendency to congregate close to other members of a flock, although this behavior varies with breed, and sheep can become stressed when separated from their flock members
Sheep|sheep|During flocking, sheep have a strong tendency to follow, and a leader may simply be the first individual to move
Sheep|sheep|Relationships in flocks tend to be closest among related sheep
Sheep|sheep|in mixed-breed flocks, subgroups of the same breed tend to form, and a ewe and her direct descendants often move as a unit within large flocks
Sheep|sheep|Sheep can become hefted to one particular local pasture (heft) so they do not roam freely in unfenced landscapes
Sheep|sheep|Lambs learn the heft from ewes and if whole flocks are culled it must be retaught to the replacement animals.Flock behaviour in sheep is generally only exhibited in groups of four or more sheep; fewer sheep may not react as expected when alone or with few other sheep
Sheep|sheep|Being a prey species, the primary defense mechanism of sheep is to flee from danger when their flight zone is entered
Sheep|sheep|Cornered sheep may charge and butt, or threaten by hoof stamping and adopting an aggressive posture
Sheep|sheep|This is particularly true for ewes with newborn lambs.In regions where sheep have no natural predators, none of the native breeds of sheep exhibit a strong flocking behavior.
Sheep|sheep|Farmers exploit flocking behavior to keep sheep together on unfenced pastures such as hill farming, and to move them more easily
Sheep|sheep|For this purpose shepherds may use herding dogs in this effort, with a highly bred herding ability
Sheep|sheep|Sheep are food-oriented, and association of humans with regular feeding often results in sheep soliciting people for food
Sheep|sheep|Those who are moving sheep may exploit this behavior by leading sheep with buckets of feed.
Sheep|sheep|Sheep establish a dominance hierarchy through fighting, threats and competitiveness
Sheep|sheep|Dominant animals are inclined to be more aggressive with other sheep, and usually feed first at troughs
Sheep|sheep|Primarily among rams, horn size is a factor in the flock hierarchy
Sheep|sheep|Rams with different size horns may be less inclined to fight to establish the dominance order, while rams with similarly sized horns are more so
Sheep|sheep|Merinos have an almost linear hierarchy whereas there is a less rigid structure in Border Leicesters when a competitive feeding situation arises.In sheep, position in a moving flock is highly correlated with social dominance, but there is no definitive study to show consistent voluntary leadership by an individual sheep.
Sheep|sheep|Sheep are frequently thought of as unintelligent animals
Sheep|sheep|Their flocking behavior and quickness to flee and panic can make shepherding a difficult endeavor for the uninitiated
Sheep|sheep|Despite these perceptions, a University of Illinois monograph on sheep reported their intelligence to be just below that of pigs and on par with that of cattle.
Sheep|sheep|Sheep can recognize individual human and ovine faces and remember them for years
Sheep|sheep|In addition to long-term facial recognition of individuals, sheep can also differentiate emotional states through facial characteristics
Sheep|sheep|If worked with patiently, sheep may learn their names, and many sheep are trained to be led by halter for showing and other purposes
Sheep|sheep|Sheep have also responded well to clicker training
Sheep|sheep|Sheep have been used as pack animals; Tibetan nomads distribute baggage equally throughout a flock as it is herded between living sites.It has been reported that some sheep have apparently shown problem-solving abilities; a flock in West Yorkshire, England allegedly found a way to get over cattle grids by rolling on their backs, although documentation of this has relied on anecdotal accounts.
Sheep|sheep|Sounds made by domestic sheep include bleats, grunts, rumbles and snorts
Sheep|sheep|"Bleating (""baaing"") is used mostly for contact communication, especially between dam and lambs, but also at times between other flock members"
Sheep|sheep|The bleats of individual sheep are distinctive, enabling the ewe and her lambs to recognize each other's vocalizations
Sheep|sheep|Vocal communication between lambs and their dam declines to a very low level within several weeks after parturition
Sheep|sheep|A variety of bleats may be heard, depending on sheep age and circumstances
Sheep|sheep|Apart from contact communication, bleating may signal distress, frustration or impatience; however, sheep are usually silent when in pain
Sheep|sheep|Isolation commonly prompts bleating by sheep
Sheep|sheep|Pregnant ewes may grunt when in labor
Sheep|sheep|Rumbling sounds are made by the ram during courting; somewhat similar rumbling sounds may be made by the ewe, especially when with her neonate lambs
Sheep|sheep|A snort (explosive exhalation through the nostrils) may signal aggression or a warning, and is often elicited from startled sheep.
Sheep|sheep|In sheep breeds lacking facial wool, the visual field is wide
Sheep|sheep|In 10 sheep (Cambridge, Lleyn and Welsh Mountain breeds, which lack facial wool), the visual field ranged from 298° to 325°, averaging 313.1°, with binocular overlap ranging from 44.5° to 74°, averaging 61.7°
Sheep|sheep|"In some breeds, unshorn facial wool can limit the visual field; in some individuals, this may be enough to cause ""wool blindness"""
Sheep|sheep|In 60 Merinos, visual fields ranged from 219.1° to 303.0°, averaging 269.9°, and the binocular field ranged from 8.9° to 77.7°, averaging 47.5°; 36% of the measurements were limited by wool, although photographs of the experiments indicate that only limited facial wool regrowth had occurred since shearing
Sheep|sheep|In addition to facial wool (in some breeds), visual field limitations can include ears and (in some breeds) horns, so the visual field can be extended by tilting the head
Sheep|sheep|Sheep eyes exhibit very low hyperopia and little astigmatism
Sheep|sheep|Such visual characteristics are likely to produce a well-focused retinal image of objects in both the middle and long distance
Sheep|sheep|Because sheep eyes have no accommodation, one might expect the image of very near objects to be blurred, but a rather clear near image could be provided by the tapetum and large retinal image of the sheep's eye, and adequate close vision may occur at muzzle length
Sheep|sheep|"Good depth perception, inferred from the sheep's sure-footedness, was confirmed in ""visual cliff"" experiments; behavioral responses indicating depth perception are seen in lambs at one day old"
Sheep|sheep|Sheep are thought to have colour vision, and can distinguish between a variety of colours
Sheep|sheep|black, red, brown, green, yellow and white
Sheep|sheep|Sight is a vital part of sheep communication, and when grazing, they maintain visual contact with each other
Sheep|sheep|Each sheep lifts its head upwards to check the position of other sheep in the flock
Sheep|sheep|This constant monitoring is probably what keeps the sheep in a flock as they move along grazing
Sheep|sheep|Sheep become stressed when isolated; this stress is reduced if they are provided with a mirror, indicating that the sight of other sheep reduces stress.Taste is the most important sense in sheep, establishing forage preferences, with sweet and sour plants being preferred and bitter plants being more commonly rejected
Sheep|sheep|Touch and sight are also important in relation to specific plant characteristics, such as succulence and growth form.The ram uses his vomeronasal organ (sometimes called the Jacobson's organ) to sense the pheromones of ewes and detect when they are in estrus
Sheep|sheep|The ewe uses her vomeronasal organ for early recognition of her neonate lamb.
Sheep|sheep|Sheep follow a similar reproductive strategy to other herd animals
Sheep|sheep|A group of ewes is generally mated by a single ram, who has either been chosen by a breeder or (in feral populations) has established dominance through physical contest with other rams
Sheep|sheep|Most sheep are seasonal breeders, although some are able to breed year-round
Sheep|sheep|Ewes generally reach sexual maturity at six to eight months old, and rams generally at four to six months
Sheep|sheep|However, there are exceptions
Sheep|sheep|For example, Finnsheep ewe lambs may reach puberty as early as 3 to 4 months, and Merino ewes sometimes reach puberty at 18 to 20 months
Sheep|sheep|Ewes have estrus cycles about every 17 days, during which they emit a scent and indicate readiness through physical displays towards rams
Sheep|sheep|A minority of rams (8% on average) display a preference for homosexuality and a small number of the females that were accompanied by a male fetus in utero are freemartins (female animals that are behaviorally masculine and lack functioning ovaries).In feral sheep, rams may fight during the rut to determine which individuals may mate with ewes
Sheep|sheep|Rams, especially unfamiliar ones, will also fight outside the breeding period to establish dominance; rams can kill one another if allowed to mix freely
Sheep|sheep|During the rut, even usually friendly rams may become aggressive towards humans due to increases in their hormone levels.After mating, sheep have a gestation period of about five months, and normal labor takes one to three hours
Sheep|sheep|Although some breeds regularly throw larger litters of lambs, most produce single or twin lambs
Sheep|sheep|During or soon after labor, ewes and lambs may be confined to small lambing jugs, small pens designed to aid both careful observation of ewes and to cement the bond between them and their lambs.
Sheep|sheep|Ovine obstetrics can be problematic
Sheep|sheep|By selectively breeding ewes that produce multiple offspring with higher birth weights for generations, sheep producers have inadvertently caused some domestic sheep to have difficulty lambing; balancing ease of lambing with high productivity is one of the dilemmas of sheep breeding
Sheep|sheep|In the case of any such problems, those present at lambing may assist the ewe by extracting or repositioning lambs
Sheep|sheep|After the birth, ewes ideally break the amniotic sac (if it is not broken during labor), and begin licking clean the lamb
Sheep|sheep|Most lambs will begin standing within an hour of birth
Sheep|sheep|In normal situations, lambs nurse after standing, receiving vital colostrum milk
Sheep|sheep|Lambs that either fail to nurse or are rejected by the ewe require help to survive, such as bottle-feeding or fostering by another ewe.Most lambs begin life being born outdoors
Sheep|sheep|After lambs are several weeks old, lamb marking (ear tagging, docking, mulesing, and castrating) is carried out
Sheep|sheep|Vaccinations are usually carried out at this point as well
Sheep|sheep|Ear tags with numbers are attached, or ear marks are applied, for ease of later identification of sheep
Sheep|sheep|Docking and castration are commonly done after 24 hours (to avoid interference with maternal bonding and consumption of colostrum) and are often done not later than one week after birth, to minimize pain, stress, recovery time and complications
Sheep|sheep|The first course of vaccinations (commonly anti-clostridial) is commonly given at an age of about 10 to 12 weeks; i.e
Sheep|sheep|when the concentration of maternal antibodies passively acquired via colostrum is expected to have fallen low enough to permit development of active immunity
Sheep|sheep|Ewes are often revaccinated annually about 3 weeks before lambing, to provide high antibody concentrations in colostrum during the first several hours after lambing
Sheep|sheep|Ram lambs that will either be slaughtered or separated from ewes before sexual maturity are not usually castrated
Sheep|sheep|Objections to all these procedures have been raised by animal rights groups, but farmers defend them by saying they save money, and inflict only temporary pain.
Sheep|sheep|Sheep may fall victim to poisons, infectious diseases, and physical injuries
Sheep|sheep|As a prey species, a sheep's system is adapted to hide the obvious signs of illness, to prevent being targeted by predators
Sheep|sheep|However, some signs of ill health are obvious, with sick sheep eating little, vocalizing excessively, and being generally listless
Sheep|sheep|Throughout history, much of the money and labor of sheep husbandry has aimed to prevent sheep ailments
Sheep|sheep|Historically, shepherds often created remedies by experimentation on the farm
Sheep|sheep|In some developed countries, including the United States, sheep lack the economic importance for drug companies to perform expensive clinical trials required to approve more than a relatively limited number of drugs for ovine use
Sheep|sheep|However, extra-label drug use in sheep production is permitted in many jurisdictions, subject to certain restrictions
Sheep|sheep|In the US, for example, regulations governing extra-label drug use in animals are found in 21 CFR (Code of Federal Regulations) Part 530
Sheep|sheep|In the 20th and 21st centuries, a minority of sheep owners have turned to alternative treatments such as homeopathy, herbalism and even traditional Chinese medicine to treat sheep veterinary problems
Sheep|sheep|Despite some favorable anecdotal evidence, the effectiveness of alternative veterinary medicine has been met with skepticism in scientific journals
Sheep|sheep|The need for traditional anti-parasite drugs and antibiotics is widespread, and is the main impediment to certified organic farming with sheep.Many breeders take a variety of preventive measures to ward off problems
Sheep|sheep|The first is to ensure all sheep are healthy when purchased
Sheep|sheep|Many buyers avoid outlets known to be clearing houses for animals culled from healthy flocks as either sick or simply inferior
Sheep|sheep|This can also mean maintaining a closed flock, and quarantining new sheep for a month
Sheep|sheep|Two fundamental preventive programs are maintaining good nutrition and reducing stress in the sheep
Sheep|sheep|Restraint, isolation, loud noises, novel situations, pain, heat, extreme cold, fatigue and other stressors can lead to secretion of cortisol, a stress hormone, in amounts that may indicate welfare problems
Sheep|sheep|Excessive stress can compromise the immune system
Sheep|sheep|"""Shipping fever"" (pneumonic mannheimiosis, formerly called pasteurellosis) is a disease of particular concern, that can occur as a result of stress, notably during transport and (or) handling"
Sheep|sheep|Pain, fear and several other stressors can cause secretion of epinephrine (adrenaline)
Sheep|sheep|Considerable epinephrine secretion in the final days before slaughter can adversely affect meat quality (by causing glycogenolysis, removing the substrate for normal post-slaughter acidification of meat) and result in meat becoming more susceptible to colonization by spoilage bacteria
Sheep|sheep|Because of such issues, low-stress handling is essential in sheep management
Sheep|sheep|Avoiding poisoning is also important; common poisons are pesticide sprays, inorganic fertilizer, motor oil, as well as radiator coolant containing ethylene glycol.
Sheep|sheep|Common forms of preventive medication for sheep are vaccinations and treatments for parasites
Sheep|sheep|Both external and internal parasites are the most prevalent malady in sheep, and are either fatal, or reduce the productivity of flocks
Sheep|sheep|Worms are the most common internal parasites
Sheep|sheep|They are ingested during grazing, incubate within the sheep, and are expelled through the digestive system (beginning the cycle again)
Sheep|sheep|Oral anti-parasitic medicines, known as drenches, are given to a flock to treat worms, sometimes after worm eggs in the feces has been counted to assess infestation levels
Sheep|sheep|Afterwards, sheep may be moved to a new pasture to avoid ingesting the same parasites
Sheep|sheep|External sheep parasites include
Sheep|sheep|lice (for different parts of the body), sheep keds, nose bots, sheep itch mites, and maggots
Sheep|sheep|Keds are blood-sucking parasites that cause general malnutrition and decreased productivity, but are not fatal
Sheep|sheep|Maggots are those of the bot fly and the blow-fly, commonly Lucilia sericata or its relative L
Sheep|sheep|cuprina
Sheep|sheep|Fly maggots cause the extremely destructive condition of flystrike
Sheep|sheep|Flies lay their eggs in wounds or wet, manure-soiled wool; when the maggots hatch they burrow into a sheep's flesh, eventually causing death if untreated
Sheep|sheep|In addition to other treatments, crutching (shearing wool from a sheep's rump) is a common preventive method
Sheep|sheep|Some countries allow mulesing, a practice that involves stripping away the skin on the rump to prevent fly-strike, normally performed when the sheep is a lamb
Sheep|sheep|Nose bots are fly larvae that inhabit a sheep's sinuses, causing breathing difficulties and discomfort
Sheep|sheep|Common signs are a discharge from the nasal passage, sneezing, and frantic movement such as head shaking
Sheep|sheep|External parasites may be controlled through the use of backliners, sprays or immersive sheep dips.A wide array of bacterial and viral diseases affect sheep
Sheep|sheep|Diseases of the hoof, such as foot rot and foot scald may occur, and are treated with footbaths and other remedies
Sheep|sheep|Foot rot is present in over 97% of flocks in the UK
Sheep|sheep|These painful conditions cause lameness and hinder feeding
Sheep|sheep|Ovine Johne's disease is a wasting disease that affects young sheep
Sheep|sheep|Bluetongue disease is an insect-borne illness causing fever and inflammation of the mucous membranes
Sheep|sheep|Ovine rinderpest (or peste des petits ruminants) is a highly contagious and often fatal viral disease affecting sheep and goats
Sheep|sheep|Sheep may also be affected by primary or secondary photosensitization
Sheep|sheep|Tetanus can also afflict sheep through wounds from shearing, docking, castration, or vaccination
Sheep|sheep|The organism also can be introduced into the reproductive tract by unsanitary humans who assist ewes during lambing.A few sheep conditions are transmissible to humans
Sheep|sheep|Orf (also known as scabby mouth, contagious ecthyma or soremouth) is a skin disease leaving lesions that is transmitted through skin-to-skin contact
Sheep|sheep|Cutaneous anthrax is also called woolsorter's disease, as the spores can be transmitted in unwashed wool
Sheep|sheep|More seriously, the organisms that can cause spontaneous enzootic abortion in sheep are easily transmitted to pregnant women
Sheep|sheep|Also of concern are the prion disease scrapie and the virus that causes foot-and-mouth disease (FMD), as both can devastate flocks
Sheep|sheep|The latter poses a slight risk to humans
Sheep|sheep|During the 2001 FMD pandemic in the UK, hundreds of sheep were culled and some rare British breeds were at risk of extinction due to this.Of the 600,300 sheep lost to the US economy in 2004, 37.3% were lost to predators, while 26.5% were lost to some form of disease
Sheep|sheep|Poisoning accounted for 1.7% of non-productive deaths.
Sheep|sheep|Other than parasites and disease, predation is a threat to sheep and the profitability of sheep raising
Sheep|sheep|Sheep have little ability to defend themselves, compared with other species kept as livestock
Sheep|sheep|Even if sheep survive an attack, they may die from their injuries or simply from panic
Sheep|sheep|However, the impact of predation varies dramatically with region
Sheep|sheep|In Africa, Australia, the Americas, and parts of Europe and Asia predators are a serious problem
Sheep|sheep|In the United States, for instance, over one third of sheep deaths in 2004 were caused by predation
Sheep|sheep|In contrast, other nations are virtually devoid of sheep predators, particularly islands known for extensive sheep husbandry
Sheep|sheep|Worldwide, canids—including the domestic dog—are responsible for most sheep deaths
Sheep|sheep|Other animals that occasionally prey on sheep include
Sheep|sheep|felines, bears, birds of prey, ravens and feral hogs.Sheep producers have used a wide variety of measures to combat predation
Sheep|sheep|Pre-modern shepherds used their own presence, livestock guardian dogs, and protective structures such as barns and fencing
Sheep|sheep|Fencing (both regular and electric), penning sheep at night and lambing indoors all continue to be widely used
Sheep|sheep|More modern shepherds used guns, traps, and poisons to kill predators, causing significant decreases in predator populations
Sheep|sheep|In the wake of the environmental and conservation movements, the use of these methods now usually falls under the purview of specially designated government agencies in most developed countries.The 1970s saw a resurgence in the use of livestock guardian dogs and the development of new methods of predator control by sheep producers, many of them non-lethal
Sheep|sheep|Donkeys and guard llamas have been used since the 1980s in sheep operations, using the same basic principle as livestock guardian dogs
Sheep|sheep|Interspecific pasturing, usually with larger livestock such as cattle or horses, may help to deter predators, even if such species do not actively guard sheep
Sheep|sheep|In addition to animal guardians, contemporary sheep operations may use non-lethal predator deterrents such as motion-activated lights and noisy alarms.
Sheep|sheep|Sheep are an important part of the global agricultural economy
Sheep|sheep|However, their once vital status has been largely replaced by other livestock species, especially the pig, chicken, and cow
Sheep|sheep|China, Australia, India, and Iran have the largest modern flocks, and serve both local and exportation needs for wool and mutton
Sheep|sheep|Other countries such as New Zealand have smaller flocks but retain a large international economic impact due to their export of sheep products
Sheep|sheep|Sheep also play a major role in many local economies, which may be niche markets focused on organic or sustainable agriculture and local food customers
Sheep|sheep|Especially in developing countries, such flocks may be a part of subsistence agriculture rather than a system of trade
Sheep|sheep|Sheep themselves may be a medium of trade in barter economies.
Sheep|sheep|Domestic sheep provide a wide array of raw materials
Sheep|sheep|Wool was one of the first textiles, although in the late 20th century wool prices began to fall dramatically as the result of the popularity and cheap prices for synthetic fabrics
Sheep|sheep|For many sheep owners, the cost of shearing is greater than the possible profit from the fleece, making subsisting on wool production alone practically impossible without farm subsidies
Sheep|sheep|Fleeces are used as material in making alternative products such as wool insulation
Sheep|sheep|In the 21st century, the sale of meat is the most profitable enterprise in the sheep industry, even though far less sheep meat is consumed than chicken, pork or beef.Sheepskin is likewise used for making clothes, footwear, rugs, and other products
Sheep|sheep|Byproducts from the slaughter of sheep are also of value
Sheep|sheep|sheep tallow can be used in candle and soap making, sheep bone and cartilage has been used to furnish carved items such as dice and buttons as well as rendered glue and gelatin
Sheep|sheep|Sheep intestine can be formed into sausage casings, and lamb intestine has been formed into surgical sutures, as well as strings for musical instruments and tennis rackets
Sheep|sheep|Sheep droppings, which are high in cellulose, have even been sterilized and mixed with traditional pulp materials to make paper
Sheep|sheep|Of all sheep byproducts, perhaps the most valuable is lanolin
Sheep|sheep|the waterproof, fatty substance found naturally in sheep's wool and used as a base for innumerable cosmetics and other products.
Sheep|sheep|Some farmers who keep sheep also make a profit from live sheep
Sheep|sheep|Providing lambs for youth programs such as 4-H and competition at agricultural shows is often a dependable avenue for the sale of sheep
Sheep|sheep|Farmers may also choose to focus on a particular breed of sheep in order to sell registered purebred animals, as well as provide a ram rental service for breeding
Sheep|sheep|"A new option for deriving profit from live sheep is the rental of flocks for grazing; these ""mowing services"" are hired in order to keep unwanted vegetation down in public spaces and to lessen fire hazard.Despite the falling demand and price for sheep products in many markets, sheep have distinct economic advantages when compared with other livestock"
Sheep|sheep|They do not require expensive housing, such as that used in the intensive farming of chickens or pigs
Sheep|sheep|They are an efficient use of land; roughly six sheep can be kept on the amount that would suffice for a single cow or horse
Sheep|sheep|Sheep can also consume plants, such as noxious weeds, that most other animals will not touch, and produce more young at a faster rate
Sheep|sheep|Also, in contrast to most livestock species, the cost of raising sheep is not necessarily tied to the price of feed crops such as grain, soybeans and corn
Sheep|sheep|Combined with the  lower cost of quality sheep, all these factors combine to equal a lower overhead for sheep producers, thus entailing a higher profitability potential for the small farmer
Sheep|sheep|Sheep are especially beneficial for independent producers, including family farms with limited resources, as the sheep industry is one of the few types of animal agriculture that has not been vertically integrated by agribusiness
Sheep|sheep|However, small flocks, from 10 to 50 ewes, often are not profitable because they tend to be poorly managed
Sheep|sheep|The primary reason is that mechanization is not feasible, so return per hour of labor is not maximized
Sheep|sheep|Small farm flocks generally are used simply to control weeds on irrigation ditches or maintained as a hobby.
Sheep|sheep|Sheep meat and milk were one of the earliest staple proteins consumed by human civilization after the transition from hunting and gathering to agriculture
Sheep|sheep|Sheep meat prepared for food is known as either mutton or lamb, and approximately 540 million sheep are slaughtered each year for meat worldwide
Sheep|sheep|"""Mutton"" is derived from the Old French moton, which was the word for sheep used by the Anglo-Norman rulers of much of the British Isles in the Middle Ages"
Sheep|sheep|This became the name for sheep meat in English, while the Old English word sceap was kept for the live animal
Sheep|sheep|"Throughout modern history, ""mutton"" has been limited to the meat of mature sheep usually at least two years of age; ""lamb"" is used for that of immature sheep less than a year.In the 21st century, the nations with the highest consumption of sheep meat are the Arab States of the Persian Gulf, New Zealand, Australia, Greece, Uruguay, the United Kingdom and Ireland"
Sheep|sheep|These countries eat 14–40 lbs (3–18 kg) of sheep meat per capita, per annum
Sheep|sheep|Sheep meat is also popular in France, Africa (especially the Arab World), the Caribbean, the rest of the Middle East, India, and parts of China
Sheep|sheep|This often reflects a history of sheep production
Sheep|sheep|In these countries in particular, dishes comprising alternative cuts and offal may be popular or traditional
Sheep|sheep|Sheep testicles—called animelles or lamb fries—are considered a delicacy in many parts of the world
Sheep|sheep|Perhaps the most unusual dish of sheep meat is the Scottish haggis, composed of various sheep innards cooked along with oatmeal and chopped onions inside its stomach
Sheep|sheep|In comparison, countries such as the U.S
Sheep|sheep|consume only a pound or less (under 0.5 kg), with Americans eating 50 pounds (22 kg) of pork and 65 pounds (29 kg) of beef
Sheep|sheep|In addition, such countries rarely eat mutton, and may favor the more expensive cuts of lamb
Sheep|sheep|mostly lamb chops and leg of lamb.Though sheep's milk may be drunk rarely in fresh form, today it is used predominantly in cheese and yogurt making
Sheep|sheep|Sheep have only two teats, and produce a far smaller volume of milk than cows
Sheep|sheep|However, as sheep's milk contains far more fat, solids, and minerals than cow's milk, it is ideal for the cheese-making process
Sheep|sheep|It also resists contamination during cooling better because of its much higher calcium content
Sheep|sheep|Well-known cheeses made from sheep milk include the Feta of Bulgaria and Greece, Roquefort of France, Manchego from Spain, the Pecorino Romano (the Italian word for sheep is pecore) and Ricotta of Italy
Sheep|sheep|Yogurts, especially some forms of strained yogurt, may also be made from sheep milk
Sheep|sheep|Many of these products are now often made with cow's milk, especially when produced outside their country of origin
Sheep|sheep|Sheep milk contains 4.8% lactose, which may affect those who are intolerant.As with other domestic animals, the meat of uncastrated males is inferior in quality, especially as they grow
Sheep|sheep|"A ""bucky"" lamb is a lamb which was not castrated early enough, or which was castrated improperly (resulting in one testicle being retained)"
Sheep|sheep|These lambs are worth less at market.
Sheep|sheep|Sheep are generally too large and reproduce too slowly to make ideal research subjects, and thus are not a common model organism
Sheep|sheep|They have, however, played an influential role in some fields of science
Sheep|sheep|In particular, the Roslin Institute of Edinburgh, Scotland used sheep for genetics research that produced groundbreaking results
Sheep|sheep|In 1995, two ewes named Megan and Morag were the first mammals cloned from differentiated cells
Sheep|sheep|"A year later, a Finnish Dorset sheep named Dolly, dubbed ""the world's most famous sheep"" in Scientific American, was the first mammal to be cloned from an adult somatic cell"
Sheep|sheep|Following this, Polly and Molly were the first mammals to be simultaneously cloned and transgenic.
Sheep|sheep|As of 2008, the sheep genome has not been fully sequenced, although a detailed genetic map has been published, and a draft version of the complete genome produced by assembling sheep DNA sequences using information given by the genomes of other mammals
Sheep|sheep|"In 2012, a transgenic sheep named ""Peng Peng"" was cloned by Chinese scientists, who spliced his genes with that of a roundworm (C"
Sheep|sheep|elegans) in order to increase production of fats healthier for human consumption.In the study of natural selection, the population of Soay sheep that remain on the island of Hirta have been used to explore the relation of body size and coloration to reproductive success
Sheep|sheep|Soay sheep come in several colors, and researchers investigated why the larger, darker sheep were in decline; this occurrence contradicted the rule of thumb that larger members of a population tend to be more successful reproductively
Sheep|sheep|The feral Soays on Hirta are especially useful subjects because they are isolated.Sheep are one of the few animals where the molecular basis of the diversity of male sexual preferences has been examined
Sheep|sheep|However, this research has been controversial, and much publicity has been produced by a study at the Oregon Health and Science University that investigated the mechanisms that produce homosexuality in rams
Sheep|sheep|Organizations such as PETA campaigned against the study, accusing scientists of trying to cure homosexuality in the sheep
Sheep|sheep|OHSU and the involved scientists vehemently denied such accusations.Domestic sheep are sometimes used in medical research, particularly for researching cardiovascular physiology, in areas such as hypertension and heart failure
Sheep|sheep|Pregnant sheep are also a useful model for human pregnancy, and have been used to investigate the effects on fetal development of malnutrition and hypoxia
Sheep|sheep|In behavioral sciences, sheep have been used in isolated cases for the study of facial recognition, as their mental process of recognition is qualitatively similar to humans.
Sheep|sheep|Sheep have had a strong presence in many cultures, especially in areas where they form the most common type of livestock
Sheep|sheep|In the English language, to call someone a sheep or ovine may allude that they are timid and easily led
Sheep|sheep|In contradiction to this image, male sheep are often used as symbols of virility and power; the logos of the Los Angeles Rams football team and the Dodge Ram pickup truck allude to males of the bighorn sheep, Ovis canadensis.
Sheep|sheep|Counting sheep is popularly said to be an aid to sleep, and some ancient systems of counting sheep persist today
Sheep|sheep|"Sheep also enter in colloquial sayings and idiom frequently with such phrases as ""black sheep"""
Sheep|sheep|To call an individual a black sheep implies that they are an odd or disreputable member of a group
Sheep|sheep|This usage derives from the recessive trait that causes an occasional black lamb to be born into an entirely white flock
Sheep|sheep|These black sheep were considered undesirable by shepherds, as black wool is not as commercially viable as white wool
Sheep|sheep|Citizens who accept overbearing governments have been referred to by the Portmanteau neologism of sheeple
Sheep|sheep|"Somewhat differently, the adjective ""sheepish"" is also used to describe embarrassment."
Sheep|sheep|In British heraldry, sheep appear in the form of rams, sheep proper and lambs
Sheep|sheep|These are distinguished by the ram being depicted with horns and a tail, the sheep with neither and the lamb with its tail only
Sheep|sheep|A further variant of the lamb, termed the Paschal lamb, is depicted as carrying a Christian cross and with a halo over its head
Sheep|sheep|Rams' heads, portrayed without a neck and facing the viewer, are also found in British armories
Sheep|sheep|The fleece, depicted as an entire sheepskin carried by a ring around its midsection, originally became known through its use in the arms of the Order of the Golden Fleece and was later adopted by towns and individuals with connections to the wool industry.
Sheep|sheep|In antiquity, symbolism involving sheep cropped up in religions in the ancient Near East, the Mideast, and the Mediterranean area
Sheep|sheep|Çatalhöyük, ancient Egyptian religion, the Cana'anite and Phoenician tradition, Judaism, Greek religion, and others
Sheep|sheep|Religious symbolism and ritual involving sheep began with some of the first known faiths
Sheep|sheep|Skulls of rams (along with bulls) occupied central placement in shrines at the Çatalhöyük settlement in 8,000 BCE
Sheep|sheep|In Ancient Egyptian religion, the ram was the symbol of several gods
Sheep|sheep|Khnum, Heryshaf and Amun (in his incarnation as a god of fertility)
Sheep|sheep|Other deities occasionally shown with ram features include the goddess Ishtar, the Phoenician god Baal-Hamon, and the Babylonian god Ea-Oannes
Sheep|sheep|In Madagascar, sheep were not eaten as they were believed to be incarnations of the souls of ancestors.There are many ancient Greek references to sheep
Sheep|sheep|that of Chrysomallos, the golden-fleeced ram, continuing to be told through into the modern era
Sheep|sheep|Astrologically, Aries, the ram, is the first sign of the classical Greek zodiac, and the sheep is the eighth of the twelve animals associated with the 12-year cycle of in the Chinese zodiac, related to the Chinese calendar
Sheep|sheep|In Mongolia, shagai are an ancient form of dice made from the cuboid bones of sheep that are often used for fortunetelling purposes.
Sheep|sheep|Sheep play an important role in all the Abrahamic faiths; Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, Moses, King David and the Islamic prophet Muhammad were all shepherds
Sheep|sheep|According to the Biblical story of the Binding of Isaac, a ram is sacrificed as a substitute for Isaac after an angel stays Abraham's hand (in the Islamic tradition, Abraham was about to sacrifice Ishmael)
Sheep|sheep|Eid al-Adha is a major annual festival in Islam in which sheep (or other animals) are sacrificed in remembrance of this act
Sheep|sheep|Sheep are occasionally sacrificed to commemorate important secular events in Islamic cultures
Sheep|sheep|Greeks and Romans sacrificed sheep regularly in religious practice, and Judaism once sacrificed sheep as a Korban (sacrifice), such as the Passover lamb
Sheep|sheep|Ovine symbols—such as the ceremonial blowing of a shofar—still find a presence in modern Judaic traditions.
Sheep|sheep|Collectively, followers of Christianity are often referred to as a flock, with Christ as the Good Shepherd, and sheep are an element in the Christian iconography of the birth of Jesus
Sheep|sheep|Some Christian saints are considered patrons of shepherds, and even of sheep themselves
Sheep|sheep|Christ is also portrayed as the Sacrificial lamb of God (Agnus Dei) and Easter celebrations in Greece and Romania traditionally feature a meal of Paschal lamb
Sheep|sheep|A church leader is often called the pastor, which is derived from the Latin word for shepherd
Sheep|sheep|In many western Christian traditions bishops carry a staff, which also serves as a symbol of the episcopal office, known as a crosier, which is modeled on the shepherd's crook.

Chris (sheep)|sheep|Chris (July 2010 – 22 October 2019) was a Merino ram who gained international fame in September 2015 after being shorn of a record amount of wool in Canberra, Australia
Chris (sheep)|sheep|"Chris was named after a sheep character in the sitcom Father Ted (specifically from the episode ""Chirpy Burpy Cheap Sheep"") by local Bonner resident Sue Dowling, who spotted the sheep wandering in a paddock near the Bonner district in Canberra."
Chris (sheep)|sheep|Chris was found at Mulligan's Flat near the border of New South Wales and the Australian Capital Territory (ACT)
Chris (sheep)|sheep|His mobility had been impaired as a result of the weight of the fleece he had grown over more than five years
Chris (sheep)|sheep|Domestic sheep like Chris raised for their wool have been bred not to lose their coat and need to be shorn regularly, so leaving the sheep unshorn would have put the animal at great risk of infection and/or injury.Four-time Australian Shearing Championship winner Ian Elkins volunteered to shear the massive ram after being contacted by RSPCA Australia
Chris (sheep)|sheep|Chris had to be sedated throughout the procedure, during which the shearer removed up to 40.45 kilograms (89.2 lb) of thick wool after working about 42 minutes.Australian sheep are usually shorn annually and their fleeces usually weigh about 5 kilograms (11 lb)
Chris (sheep)|sheep|"Chris's fleece set a world record, beating previous records held by neglected sheep such as Shrek (27 kilograms (60 lb)) and ""Big Ben"""
Chris (sheep)|sheep|Chris's record fleece of 41.4 kilograms (91 lb) was confirmed by Guinness World Records, but the length of the fleece (42 centimetres (17 in)) meant it had no commercial value
Chris (sheep)|sheep|It was estimated that Chris's fleece was enough to make 30 jumpers.
Chris (sheep)|sheep|"Chris was put up for adoption by the RSPCA, who reported that the sheep needed to recover from his operation and adjust to a life without a ""cumbersome blanket of wool"", although his hind legs may have suffered some permanent imbalance from years of bearing the extra weight"
Chris (sheep)|sheep|Hundreds of people offered to adopt Chris but in September 2015 he was adopted by the Little Oak Sanctuary in New South Wales, where he gradually became more confident with people
Chris (sheep)|sheep|The co-founder of the sanctuary reported that he liked having his bulb rubbed.
Chris (sheep)|sheep|Chris died of natural causes aged 9 on 22 October 2019.In 2016, Chris's complete fleece, measuring 160 centimetres (63 in) long by 110 centimetres (43 in) wide, was acquired by the National Museum of Australia, where it was put on display and has become a popular exhibit.A children's picture book about Chris's life after he was separated from his flock and before he was rescued was written by the RSPCA and illustrated by Kylie Fogarty
Chris (sheep)|sheep|Entitled The Misadventures of Chris the Sheep, the story offered young readers a possible explanation for why he grew so big
Chris (sheep)|sheep|"The book was an effort ""to educate children about animal welfare"" and proceeds from its sale went to help the RSPCA in the ACT to continue its work protecting, rescuing, caring and advocating for animals in need."

Pen (enclosure)|sheep|A pen is an enclosure for holding livestock
Pen (enclosure)|sheep|It may also perhaps be used as a term for an enclosure for other animals such as pets that are unwanted inside the house
Pen (enclosure)|sheep|The term describes types of enclosures that may confine one or many animals
Pen (enclosure)|sheep|Construction and terminology vary depending on the region of the world, purpose, animal species to be confined, local materials used and tradition
Pen (enclosure)|sheep|Pen or penning as a verb refers to the act of confining animals in an enclosure.
Pen (enclosure)|sheep|Similar terms are kraal, boma, and corrals
Pen (enclosure)|sheep|"Encyclopædia Britannica notes usage of the term ""kraal"" for elephant corrals in India, Sri Lanka, and Thailand."
Pen (enclosure)|sheep|In Australia and New Zealand a pen is a small enclosure for livestock (especially sheep or cattle), which is part of a larger construction, e.g
Pen (enclosure)|sheep|calf pen, forcing pen (or yard) in sheep or cattle yards, or a sweating pen or catching pen in a shearing shed
Pen (enclosure)|sheep|In Australia, a paddock may encompass a large, fenced grazing area of many acres, not to be confused with the American English use of paddock as interchangeable with corral or pen, describing smaller, confined areas.
Pen (enclosure)|sheep|In British English, a sheep pen is also called a folding, sheepfold or sheepcote
Pen (enclosure)|sheep|Modern shepherds more commonly use terms such as closing or confinement pen for small sheep pens
Pen (enclosure)|sheep|Most structures today referred to as sheepfolds are ancient dry stone semicircles.
Pen (enclosure)|sheep|Panamure was an enclosure and associated town founded in 1896 within a forest owned by Francis Molamure, where 10 roundups of wild elephants occurred, the last in 1950
Pen (enclosure)|sheep|The term kraal referred to the enclosure and to a roundup/hunt.
Pen (enclosure)|sheep|The Elephant Kraal of Ayutthaya, in Ayutthaya, a provincial capital, dates from the 1500s
Pen (enclosure)|sheep|The last roundup of wild elephants was in 1903.
Pen (enclosure)|sheep|In the United States, the term pen usually describes outdoor small enclosures for holding animals
Pen (enclosure)|sheep|These may be for encasing livestock or pets that cannot be kept indoors
Pen (enclosure)|sheep|Pens may be named by their purpose, such as a holding pen, used for short-term confinement
Pen (enclosure)|sheep|A pen for cattle may also be called a corral, a term borrowed from the Spanish language
Pen (enclosure)|sheep|Groups of pens that are part of a larger complex may be called a stockyard, where a series of pens hold a large number of animals, or a feedlot, which is a type of stockyard used to confine animals that are being fattened
Pen (enclosure)|sheep|A large pen for horses is called a paddock (Eastern US) or a corral (Western US)
Pen (enclosure)|sheep|In some places, an exhibition arena may be called a show pen
Pen (enclosure)|sheep|A small pen for horses (no more than 15–20 feet on any side) is only known as a pen if it lacks any roof or shelter, otherwise, it is called a stall and is part of a stable
Pen (enclosure)|sheep|A large fenced grazing area of many acres is called a pasture, or, in some cases, rangeland.
Pen (enclosure)|sheep|Primitive pens in South Africa are called kraal
Pen (enclosure)|sheep|Keddah is the term used in India for the enclosure constructed to entrap elephants, in Ceylon the word employed in the same meaning is corral.In Indonesia it called kandang.
Pen (enclosure)|sheep|For pets, specialized folding fencing referred to as an exercise pen, x-pen, or ex-pen, is used to surround an area, usually outdoors but not always, in which the animals can freely move around
Pen (enclosure)|sheep|They are commonly used for dogs, such as to give puppies or adult dogs more space than dog crates, but can also be used for rabbits and other animals
Pen (enclosure)|sheep|Exercise pens are usually made of sturdy wire, but can also be plastic or wood.
Pen (enclosure)|sheep|Pen mating means that, ideally, a cohort of females is brought into the male's pen and he services them all while they are in the pen
Pen (enclosure)|sheep|This is the least labor-intensive mating system because the females are just left to mate at will
Pen (enclosure)|sheep|This mating is also the least efficient in terms of male power and efficiency as they do not need to do much in terms of exercising their power.
Sheep–goat chimera|sheep|A sheep–goat chimera (sometimes called a geep in popular media) is a chimera produced by combining the embryos of a goat and a sheep; the resulting animal has cells of both sheep and goat origin
Sheep–goat chimera|sheep|A sheep-goat chimera should not be confused with a sheep-goat hybrid, which can result when a goat mates with a sheep.
Sheep–goat chimera|sheep|The first sheep–goat chimeras were created by researchers at the Institute of Animal Physiology in Cambridge, England by combining sheep embryos with goat embryos
Sheep–goat chimera|sheep|They reported their results in 1984
Sheep–goat chimera|sheep|The successful chimeras were a mosaic of goat and sheep cells and tissues.
Sheep–goat chimera|sheep|In a chimera, each set of cells (germ line) keeps its own species' identity instead of being intermediate in type between the parental species
Sheep–goat chimera|sheep|Because the chimera contains cells from (at least) two genetically different embryos, and each of these arose by fertilization of an egg by a sperm cell, it has (at least) four genetic parents
Sheep–goat chimera|sheep|In contrast, a hybrid has only two.
Sheep–goat chimera|sheep|Although the individual cells in interspecies chimeras are entirely of one of the component species, their behaviour is influenced by the environment in which they find themselves
Sheep–goat chimera|sheep|The sheep-goat chimeras have yielded several demonstrations of this
Sheep–goat chimera|sheep|The most obvious was that the woolly areas of their fleece, tufts of goat wool (angora-type) grew intermingled with ordinary sheep wool, even though the goat breed used in the experiments did not exhibit any wool whatsoever.
Sheep–goat chimera|sheep|Sheep–goat chimeras as a general rule may be assumed to be fertile, with the reservations that apply to chimeras generally (which again reflect that the parent embryos may have been of different sex, so that the animal, apart from being a chimera, may also be intersex)
Sheep–goat chimera|sheep|But in accordance with the mosaic- (as opposed to hybrid-) nature of the interspecies chimera, any individual sperm or egg cell it produces must be of either the pure sheep or the pure goat variety
Sheep–goat chimera|sheep|Whether in fact viable germ cells of both species may be, or have been, produced within the same individual is unknown.
Sheep–goat hybrid|sheep|A sheep–goat hybrid (called a geep in popular media or sometimes a shoat) is the  offspring of a sheep and a goat
Sheep–goat hybrid|sheep|While sheep and goats seem similar and can be mated, they belong to different genera in the subfamily Caprinae of the family Bovidae
Sheep–goat hybrid|sheep|Sheep belong to the genus Ovis and have 54 chromosomes, while goats belong to the genus Capra and have 60 chromosomes
Sheep–goat hybrid|sheep|The offspring of a sheep-goat pairing is generally stillborn
Sheep–goat hybrid|sheep|Despite widespread shared pasturing of goats and sheep, hybrids are very rare, indicating the genetic distance between the two species
Sheep–goat hybrid|sheep|They are not to be confused with sheep–goat chimera, which are artificially created by combining the embryos of a goat and a sheep.
Sheep–goat hybrid|sheep|At the Botswana Ministry of Agriculture in 2000, a male sheep impregnated a female goat resulting in a live offspring
Sheep–goat hybrid|sheep|This hybrid had 57 chromosomes, intermediate between sheep (54) and goats (60) and was intermediate between the two parent species in type
Sheep–goat hybrid|sheep|It had a coarse outer coat, a woolly inner coat, long goat-like legs and a heavy sheep-like body
Sheep–goat hybrid|sheep|Although infertile, the hybrid had a very active libido, mounting both ewes and does even when they were not in heat
Sheep–goat hybrid|sheep|He was castrated when he was 10 months old, as were the other kids and lambs in the herd.A male sheep impregnated a female goat in New Zealand resulting in a mixed litter of kids and a female sheep-goat hybrid with 57 chromosomes
Sheep–goat hybrid|sheep|The hybrid was subsequently shown to be fertile when mated with a ram.In France natural mating of a doe with a ram produced a female hybrid carrying 57 chromosomes
Sheep–goat hybrid|sheep|This animal backcrossed in the veterinary college of Nantes to a ram delivered a stillborn and a living male offspring with 54 chromosomes.In March 2014 a buck-ewe hybrid was born on a farm close to Göttingen in Germany
Sheep–goat hybrid|sheep|Also in March 2014, a male buck-ewe hybrid was born in Ireland.There was a reported case of live births of twin geep on a farm in Ireland in 2018.There was reported case of a live birth of a sheep-goat hybrid on a farm in Tábor in Czech Republic in 2020
Sheep–goat hybrid|sheep|Her name was Barunka and she had health complications after being born
Sheep–goat hybrid|sheep|Her owners did not know if she was a goat or sheep, since neither goats nor sheep accepted her
Sheep–goat hybrid|sheep|Upon further inspection, it was discovered she was a sheep-goat hybrid.
Sheep–goat hybrid|sheep|There is a long-standing belief in sheep–goat hybrids, which is presumably due to the animals' resemblance to each other
Sheep–goat hybrid|sheep|Some primitive varieties of sheep may be misidentified as goats
Sheep–goat hybrid|sheep|In Darwinism – An Exposition of the Theory of Natural Selection with Some of Its Applications (1889), Alfred Russel Wallace wrote
Sheep–goat hybrid|sheep|[...] the following statement of Mr
Sheep–goat hybrid|sheep|Low
Sheep–goat hybrid|sheep|"""It has been long known to shepherds, though questioned by naturalists, that the progeny of the cross between the sheep and goat is fertile"
Sheep–goat hybrid|sheep|"Breeds of this mixed race are numerous in the north of Europe."" Nothing appears to be known of such hybrids either in Scandinavia or in Italy; but Professor Giglioli of Florence has kindly given me some useful references to works in which they are described"
Sheep–goat hybrid|sheep|The following extract from his letter is very interesting
Sheep–goat hybrid|sheep|"""I need not tell you that there being such hybrids is now generally accepted as a fact"

Sheep–goat hybrid|sheep|i
Sheep–goat hybrid|sheep|p
Sheep–goat hybrid|sheep|466, Agriculture, 1862)
Sheep–goat hybrid|sheep|Hybrids bred from goat and sheep are called 'chabin' in French, and 'cabruno' in Spanish
Sheep–goat hybrid|sheep|"In Chile such hybrids are called 'carneros lanudos'; their breeding inter se appears to be not always successful, and often the original cross has to be recommenced to obtain the proportion of three-eighths of he-goat and five-eighths of sheep, or of three-eighths of ram and five-eighths of she-goat; such being the reputed best hybrids."""
Sheep–goat hybrid|sheep|Supposedly, most sheep–goat hybrids die as embryos
Sheep–goat hybrid|sheep|Hybrid male mammals are often sterile, demonstrating a phenomenon known as Haldane's rule
Sheep–goat hybrid|sheep|The Haldane phenomenon may apply even when the parent species have the same number of chromosomes, as in most cat-species hybrids
Sheep–goat hybrid|sheep|It sometimes does not apply when the species chromosome number is different, as in wild horse (chromosome number = 66) with domestic horse (chromosome number = 64) hybrids
Sheep–goat hybrid|sheep|Hybrid female fertility tends to decrease with increasing divergence in chromosome similarity between parent species
Sheep–goat hybrid|sheep|Presumably, this is due to mismatch problems during meiosis and the resulting production of eggs with unbalanced genetic complements
Sheep–goat hybrid|sheep|However, a buck-ewe hybrid born in 2014 died of pregnancy related complications in 2018 raising the question if the parent-species combination has an influence on hybrid fertility
Sheep–goat hybrid|sheep|Blood transcriptome analysis of a buck-ewe hybrid and its parents revealed significant deviations from previously described imprinting schemes and a higher contribution from the goat genome to the genes expressed in the hybrid's blood
Sheep–goat hybrid|sheep|Due to the common genome, buck-ewe hybrid share 870 common genes with the maternal goat and 368 genes with the paternal sheep.
Shrek (sheep)|sheep|Shrek (27 November 1994 – 6 June 2011) was a Merino wether (castrated male sheep) belonging to Bendigo Station, a sheep station near Tarras, New Zealand, who gained international fame in 2004, after he avoided being caught and shorn for six years
Shrek (sheep)|sheep|Merinos are normally shorn annually, but Shrek apparently hid in caves, avoiding muster
Shrek (sheep)|sheep|He was named after the fictional ogre in books and films of the same name.After finally being caught on 15 April 2004, the wether was shorn by a professional in 20 minutes on 28 April
Shrek (sheep)|sheep|The shearing was broadcast on national television in New Zealand
Shrek (sheep)|sheep|His fleece contained enough wool to make 20 large men's suits, weighing 27 kg (60 lb) – an average Merino fleece weighs around 4.5 kg (10 lb), with exceptional weights up to around 15 kg (33 lb).Shrek became a national icon
Shrek (sheep)|sheep|He was taken to parliament to meet the then-New Zealand Prime Minister, Helen Clark, in May 2004, to celebrate his 10th birthday
Shrek (sheep)|sheep|In November 2006, 30 months after his initial shearing, Shrek was shorn again, on an iceberg floating off the coast of Dunedin, New Zealand.Shrek was euthanised on 6 June 2011 on a veterinarian's advice
Shrek (sheep)|sheep|He was 16.
Sonny Wool|sheep|Sonny Wool is a sheep from the North Island of New Zealand
Sonny Wool|sheep|Born in Dannevirke circa 2008, he is named after All Black Sonny Bill Williams
Sonny Wool|sheep|He became famous after his feeding behaviour was used to correctly predict the winner of each of the New Zealand national rugby union team's matches at the 2011 Rugby World Cup
Sonny Wool|sheep|His role at the 2011 Rugby World Cup has been compared to that of Paul the Octopus at the 2010 FIFA World Cup.Sonny Wool’s owner is Beverley Dowling
Sonny Wool|sheep|His agent is Dan Boyd, who also designed the sheep’s prediction process
Sonny Wool|sheep|The prediction process was designed so that Sonny Wool was presented with two boxes containing feed in the form of hay, each box marked on the outside with the flag of a national rugby union team in a forthcoming match
Sonny Wool|sheep|His choice of which hay to eat first was interpreted as indicating his prediction of a win for the country whose flag was on that box
Sonny Wool|sheep|Selections by the sheep have been correct in all of New Zealand’s matches in the 2011 Rugby World Cup, though predictions for the other three quarter-finals turned out to be incorrect.
Sonny Wool|sheep|Sonny Wool has his own website, Facebook and Twitter accounts
Sonny Wool|sheep|He was reported to be under 24-hour security watch after receiving death threats.
Sonny Wool|sheep|According to Dan Boyd, as a lamb, Sonny Wool predicted when it was going to rain
Sonny Wool|sheep|His manager describes him as “a bit socially inept” who prefers the company of humans and has “got a few fetishes for things – one is light at night and he really likes rugby balls”.
U.S. Sheep Experiment Station|sheep|The U.S
U.S. Sheep Experiment Station|sheep|Sheep Experiment Station (USSES) is an agricultural experiment station focusing on domestic sheep (Ovis aries) which is run by the United States Department of Agriculture's Agricultural Research Service
U.S. Sheep Experiment Station|sheep|"Its stated mission is ""...to develop integrated methods for increasing production efficiency of sheep and to simultaneously improve the sustainability of rangeland ecosystems""."
U.S. Sheep Experiment Station|sheep|The station is located roughly six miles north of Dubois, Idaho, and its lands span both Idaho and Montana
U.S. Sheep Experiment Station|sheep|Its headquarters are on 27,930 acres (113.0 km2) of land owned by the Agricultural Research Service, including research facilities, animal facilities (such as lambing pens and dry lots), as well as residential facilities
U.S. Sheep Experiment Station|sheep|The station is surrounded by the Caribou-Targhee National Forest, as well being within two hours of the Grand Teton  and Yellowstone National Parks.It also holds roughly 16,600 acres (67.2 km2) within Montana's Centennial Mountains and 1,200 acres (4.9 km2) near Kilgore, Idaho, both of which are used largely for seasonal grazing and rangeland research
U.S. Sheep Experiment Station|sheep|The USSES spans several diverse ecosystems, including subalpine meadow, foothill, sagebrush steppe, and desert shrubland
U.S. Sheep Experiment Station|sheep|The station is the second largest employer in Clark County, Idaho.

Venray sheep companies|sheep|With an area of almost 150 square kilometres, Venray, a municipality in the north of Limburg, is one of the largest municipalities in the Netherlands
Venray sheep companies|sheep|More than half of the land used to be part of the Peel, an area of vital importance for the local farmers
Venray sheep companies|sheep|The presence of wide areas of moorland led to the development of sheep farming and related cottage industries, such as the production of yarn, cloth and hats
Venray sheep companies|sheep|Sheep produced an average of 2,5 kilograms of wool each per annum, and were therefore a welcome source of secondary income, quite apart from the droppings that they left on the land
Venray sheep companies|sheep|At that time sheep were not reared for their meat.
Venray sheep companies|sheep|Around 1809 some of the sheep farmers had the idea of driving their sheep to Paris, at that time the capital city of the empire to which they belonged, and offering them for sale
Venray sheep companies|sheep|When it became known that this trade was profitable, others soon followed in the pioneers' footsteps
Venray sheep companies|sheep|"Five farmers pooled their interests and founded a partnership, ""De Grote Compagnie"" (The big company), which set up an organized trade route between Venray and Paris, with fixed staging posts along the way."
Venray sheep companies|sheep|The drive on foot to the markets of Paris took two weeks on average, and ran south of the Peel to Antwerp, and then through the lush pastures along the Schelde to northern France
Venray sheep companies|sheep|The herds were collected together in the border village of Warcoing before undertaking the last stage of their journey to Paris.
Venray sheep companies|sheep|Dutch sheep farmers were meanwhile unable to cope with the demand, so that ever increasing numbers of German sheep were being bought, and when even this source proved inadequate, representatives of the company travelled to the Ukraine, Denmark and Iceland in circa 1875, and in 1891 a trading office was opened in Buenos Aires, which arranged for the transport of not just live sheep, but also deep-frozen meat to Europe
Venray sheep companies|sheep|At the beginning of the 20th century, the meat trade in the slaughterhouses of Paris, London and Antwerp was dominated by Venray businesses, and until the outbreak of World War II they were the most important producers of bacon and tinned ham in Poland, Hungary, and Canada.
Venray sheep companies|sheep|"Although the smaller sheep companies folded one by one after 1900, ""De Grote Compagnie"" remained in existence until 1951, when representatives of the eleven participating families from a number of different countries held their final annual gathering in the high-class Swan Hotel in Venray, at the card table of which, 150 years earlier, their joint company had been founded"
Venray sheep companies|sheep|In the intervening time this initiative had given rise to a host of independent companies
Venray sheep companies|sheep|At this gathering the final collective bank balance, a sum of 5,000 guilders, was presented to the parochial church of Venray to finance a new choir stall, which since then serves as a reminder of a unique example of Limburg enterprise.
Wool|sheep|Wool is the textile fibre obtained from sheep and other animals, including cashmere and mohair from goats, qiviut from muskoxen, hide and fur clothing from bison, angora from rabbits, and other types of wool from camelids.Wool consists of protein together with a small percentage of lipids
Wool|sheep|In this regard it is chemically quite distinct from the another widely used textile, cotton, which is mainly cellulose.
Wool|sheep|Wool is produced by follicles which are small cells located in the skin
Wool|sheep|These follicles are located in the upper layer of the skin called the epidermis and push down into the second skin layer called the dermis as the wool fibers grow
Wool|sheep|Follicles can be classed as either primary or secondary follicles
Wool|sheep|Primary follicles produce three types of fiber
Wool|sheep|kemp, medullated fibers, and true wool fibers
Wool|sheep|Secondary follicles only produce true wool fibers
Wool|sheep|Medullated fibers share nearly identical characteristics to hair and are long but lack crimp and elasticity
Wool|sheep|Kemp fibers are very coarse and shed out
Wool|sheep|Wool's crimp, and to a lesser degree scales, make it easier to spin the fleece by helping the individual fibers attach to each other, so they stay together
Wool|sheep|Because of the crimp, wool fabrics have greater bulk than other textiles, and they hold air, which causes the fabric to retain heat
Wool|sheep|Wool has a high specific thermal resistance, so it impedes heat transfer in general
Wool|sheep|This effect has benefited desert peoples, as Bedouins and Tuaregs use wool clothes for insulation.
Wool|sheep|Felting of wool occurs upon hammering or other mechanical agitation as the microscopic barbs on the surface of wool fibers hook together
Wool|sheep|Felting generally comes under two main areas, dry felting or wet felting
Wool|sheep|Wet felting occurs when water and a lubricant (especially an alkali such as soap) are applied to the wool which is then agitated until the fibers mix and bond together
Wool|sheep|Temperature shock while damp or wet accentuates the felting process
Wool|sheep|Some natural felting can occur on the animals back.
Wool|sheep|Wool has several qualities that distinguish it from hair/fur
Wool|sheep|it is crimped and elastic.The amount of crimp corresponds to the fineness of the wool fibers
Wool|sheep|A fine wool like Merino may have up to 40 crimps per centimetre (100 crimps per inch), while coarser wool like karakul may have less than one (one or two crimps per inch)
Wool|sheep|In contrast, hair has little if any scale and no crimp, and little ability to bind into yarn
Wool|sheep|On sheep, the hair part of the fleece is called kemp
Wool|sheep|The relative amounts of kemp to wool vary from breed to breed and make some fleeces more desirable for spinning, felting, or carding into batts for quilts or other insulating products, including the famous tweed cloth of Scotland.
Wool|sheep|Wool fibers readily absorb moisture, but are not hollow
Wool|sheep|Wool can absorb almost one-third of its own weight in water.
Wool|sheep|Wool absorbs sound like many other fabrics
Wool|sheep|It is generally a creamy white color, although some breeds of sheep produce natural colors, such as black, brown, silver, and random mixes.
Wool|sheep|Wool ignites at a higher temperature than cotton and some synthetic fibers
Wool|sheep|It has a lower rate of flame spread, a lower rate of heat release, a lower heat of combustion, and does not melt or drip; it forms a char that is insulating and self-extinguishing, and it contributes less to toxic gases and smoke than other flooring products when used in carpets
Wool|sheep|Wool carpets are specified for high safety environments, such as trains and aircraft
Wool|sheep|Wool is usually specified for garments for firefighters, soldiers, and others in occupations where they are exposed to the likelihood of fire.Wool causes an allergic reaction in some people.
Wool|sheep|Sheep shearing is the process in which a worker (a shearer) cuts off the woolen fleece of a sheep
Wool|sheep|After shearing, wool-classers separate the wool into four main categories:
Wool|sheep|locksThe quality of fleeces is determined by a technique known as wool classing, whereby a qualified person, called a wool classer, groups wools of similar grading together to maximize the return for the farmer or sheep owner
Wool|sheep|In Australia, before being auctioned, all Merino fleece wool is objectively measured for average diameter (micron), yield (including the amount of vegetable matter), staple length, staple strength, and sometimes color and comfort factor.
Wool|sheep|"Wool straight off a sheep is known as ""raw wool”, “greasy wool"" or ""wool in the grease"""
Wool|sheep|This wool contains a high level of valuable lanolin, as well as the sheep's dead skin and sweat residue, and generally also contains pesticides and vegetable matter from the animal's environment
Wool|sheep|Before the wool can be used for commercial purposes, it must be scoured, a process of cleaning the greasy wool
Wool|sheep|Scouring may be as simple as a bath in warm water or as complicated as an industrial process using detergent and alkali in specialized equipment.
Wool|sheep|In less-processed wools, vegetable matter may be removed by hand and some of the lanolin left intact through the use of gentler detergents
Wool|sheep|This semigrease wool can be worked into yarn and knitted into particularly  water-resistant mittens or sweaters, such as those of the Aran Island fishermen
Wool|sheep|Lanolin removed from wool is widely used in cosmetic products such as hand creams.
Wool|sheep|Raw wool has many impurities; vegetable matter, sand, dirt and yolk which is a mixture of suint (sweat), grease, urine stains and dung locks
Wool|sheep|The sheep's body yields many types of wool with differing strengths, thicknesses, length of staple and impurities
Wool|sheep|The raw wool (greasy) is processed into 'top'
Wool|sheep|'Worsted top' requires strong straight and parallel fibres.
Wool|sheep|The quality of wool is determined by its fiber diameter, crimp, yield, color, and staple strength
Wool|sheep|Fiber diameter is the single most important wool characteristic determining quality and price.
Wool|sheep|Merino wool is typically 90–115 mm (3.5–4.5 in) in length and is very fine (between 12 and 24 microns)
Wool|sheep|The finest and most valuable wool comes from Merino hoggets
Wool|sheep|Wool taken from sheep produced for meat is typically coarser, and has fibers 40–150 mm (1.5–6 in) in length
Wool|sheep|Damage or breaks in the wool can occur if the sheep is stressed while it is growing its fleece, resulting in a thin spot where the fleece is likely to break.Wool is also separated into grades based on the measurement of the wool's diameter in microns and also its style
Wool|sheep|These grades may vary depending on the breed or purpose of the wool
Wool|sheep|For example:
Wool|sheep|Any wool finer than 25 microns can be used for garments, while coarser grades are used for outerwear or rugs
Wool|sheep|The finer the wool, the softer it is, while coarser grades are more durable and less prone to pilling.
Wool|sheep|The finest Australian and New Zealand Merino wools are known as 1PP, which is the industry benchmark of excellence for Merino wool 16.9 microns and finer
Wool|sheep|This style represents the top level of fineness, character, color, and style as determined on the basis of a series of parameters in accordance with the original dictates of British wool as applied by the Australian Wool Exchange (AWEX) Council
Wool|sheep|Only a few dozen of the millions of bales auctioned every year can be classified and marked 1PP.In the United States, three classifications of wool are named in the Wool Products Labeling Act of 1939
Wool|sheep|"Wool is ""the fiber from the fleece of the sheep or lamb or hair of the Angora or Cashmere goat (and may include the so-called specialty fibers from the hair of the camel, alpaca, llama, and vicuna) which has never been reclaimed from any woven or felted wool product"""
Wool|sheep|"""Virgin wool"" and ""new wool"" are also used to refer to such never used wool"
Wool|sheep|There are two categories of recycled wool (also called reclaimed or shoddy wool)
Wool|sheep|"""Reprocessed wool"" identifies ""wool which has been woven or felted into a wool product and subsequently reduced to a fibrous state without having been used by the ultimate consumer"""
Wool|sheep|"""Reused wool"" refers to such wool that has been used by the ultimate consumer."
Wool|sheep|Wild sheep were more hairy than woolly
Wool|sheep|Although sheep were domesticated some 9,000 to 11,000 years ago, archaeological evidence from statuary found at sites in Iran suggests selection for woolly sheep may have begun around 6000 BC, with the earliest woven wool garments having only been dated to two to three thousand years later
Wool|sheep|Woolly sheep were introduced into Europe from the Near East in the early part of the 4th millennium BC
Wool|sheep|The oldest known European wool textile, ca
Wool|sheep|1500 BC, was preserved in a Danish bog
Wool|sheep|Prior to invention of shears—probably in the Iron Age—the wool was plucked out by hand or by bronze combs
Wool|sheep|In Roman times, wool, linen, and leather clothed the European population; cotton from India was a curiosity of which only naturalists had heard, and silks, imported along the Silk Road from China, were extravagant luxury goods
Wool|sheep|Pliny the Elder records in his Natural History that the reputation for producing the finest wool was enjoyed by Tarentum, where selective breeding had produced sheep with superior fleeces, but which required special care.
Wool|sheep|In medieval times, as trade connections expanded, the Champagne fairs revolved around the production of wool cloth in small centers such as Provins
Wool|sheep|The network developed by the annual fairs meant the woolens of Provins might find their way to Naples, Sicily, Cyprus, Majorca, Spain, and even Constantinople
Wool|sheep|The wool trade developed into serious business, a generator of capital
Wool|sheep|In the 13th century, the wool trade became the economic engine of the Low Countries and central Italy
Wool|sheep|By the end of the 14th century, Italy predominated
Wool|sheep|The Florentine wool guild, Arte della Lana, sent the imported English wool to the San Martino convent for processing
Wool|sheep|Italian wool from Abruzzo and Spanish merino wools were processed at Garbo workshops
Wool|sheep|Abruzzo wool had once been the most accessible for the Florentine guild, until improved relations with merchants in Iberia made merino wool more available
Wool|sheep|"By the 16th century Italian wool exports to the Levant had declined, eventually replaced by silk production.Both industries, based on the export of English raw wool, were rivaled only by the 15th-century sheepwalks of Castile and were a significant source of income to the English crown, which in 1275 had imposed an export tax on wool called the ""Great Custom"""
Wool|sheep|"The importance of wool to the English economy can be seen in the fact that since the 14th century, the presiding officer of the House of Lords has sat on the ""Woolsack"", a chair stuffed with wool."
Wool|sheep|Economies of scale were instituted in the Cistercian houses, which had accumulated great tracts of land during the 12th and early 13th centuries, when land prices were low and labor still scarce
Wool|sheep|Raw wool was baled and shipped from North Sea ports to the textile cities of Flanders, notably Ypres and Ghent, where it was dyed and worked up as cloth
Wool|sheep|At the time of the Black Death, English textile industries accounted for about 10% of English wool production
Wool|sheep|The English textile trade grew during the 15th century, to the point where export of wool was discouraged
Wool|sheep|Over the centuries, various British laws controlled the wool trade or required the use of wool even in burials
Wool|sheep|The smuggling of wool out of the country, known as owling, was at one time punishable by the cutting off of a hand
Wool|sheep|After the Restoration, fine English woolens began to compete with silks in the international market, partly aided by the Navigation Acts; in 1699, the English crown forbade its American colonies to trade wool with anyone but England herself.
Wool|sheep|A great deal of the value of woolen textiles was in the dyeing and finishing of the woven product
Wool|sheep|"In each of the centers of the textile trade, the manufacturing process came to be subdivided into a collection of trades, overseen by an entrepreneur in a system called by the English the ""putting-out"" system, or ""cottage industry"", and the Verlagssystem by the Germans"
Wool|sheep|In this system of producing wool cloth, once perpetuated in the production of Harris tweeds, the entrepreneur provides the raw materials and an advance, the remainder being paid upon delivery of the product
Wool|sheep|Written contracts bound the artisans to specified terms
Wool|sheep|Fernand Braudel traces the appearance of the system in the 13th-century economic boom, quoting a document of 1275
Wool|sheep|The system effectively bypassed the guilds' restrictions.
Wool|sheep|Before the flowering of the Renaissance, the Medici and other great banking houses of Florence had built their wealth and banking system on their textile industry based on wool, overseen by the Arte della Lana, the wool guild
Wool|sheep|wool textile interests guided Florentine policies
Wool|sheep|"Francesco Datini, the ""merchant of Prato"", established in 1383 an Arte della Lana for that small Tuscan city"
Wool|sheep|The sheepwalks of Castile  were controlled by the Mesta union of sheep owners.
Wool|sheep|They shaped the landscape and the fortunes of the meseta that lies in the heart of the Iberian peninsula; in the 16th century, a unified Spain allowed export of Merino lambs only with royal permission
Wool|sheep|The German wool market – based on sheep of Spanish origin – did not overtake British wool until comparatively late
Wool|sheep|The Industrial Revolution introduced mass production technology into wool and wool cloth manufacturing
Wool|sheep|Australia's colonial economy was based on sheep raising, and the Australian wool trade eventually overtook that of the Germans by 1845, furnishing wool for Bradford, which developed as the heart of industrialized woolens production.
Wool|sheep|Due to decreasing demand with increased use of synthetic fibers, wool production is much less than what it was in the past
Wool|sheep|The collapse in the price of wool began in late 1966 with a 40% drop; with occasional interruptions, the price has tended down
Wool|sheep|The result has been sharply reduced production and movement of resources into production of other commodities, in the case of sheep growers, to production of meat.Superwash wool (or washable wool) technology first appeared in the early 1970s to produce wool that has been specially treated so it is machine washable and may be tumble-dried
Wool|sheep|"This wool is produced using an acid bath that removes the ""scales"" from the fiber, or by coating the fiber with a polymer that prevents the scales from attaching to each other and causing shrinkage"
Wool|sheep|This process results in a fiber that holds longevity and durability over synthetic materials, while retaining its shape.In December 2004, a bale of the then world's finest wool, averaging 11.8 microns, sold for AU$3,000 per kilogram at auction in Melbourne, Victoria
Wool|sheep|This fleece wool tested with an average yield of 74.5%, 68 mm (2.7 in) long, and had 40 newtons per kilotex strength
Wool|sheep|The result was A$279,000 for the bale.
Wool|sheep|The finest bale of wool ever auctioned was sold for a seasonal record of AU$2690 per kilo during June 2008
Wool|sheep|This bale was produced by the Hillcreston Pinehill Partnership and measured 11.6 microns, 72.1% yield, and had a 43 newtons per kilotex strength measurement
Wool|sheep|The bale realized $247,480 and was exported to India.In 2007, a new wool suit was developed and sold in Japan that can be washed in the shower, and which dries off ready to wear within hours with no ironing required
Wool|sheep|The suit was developed using Australian Merino wool, and it enables woven products made from wool, such as suits, trousers, and skirts, to be cleaned using a domestic shower at home.In December 2006, the General Assembly of the United Nations proclaimed 2009 to be the International Year of Natural Fibres, so as to raise the profile of wool and other natural fibers.
Wool|sheep|Global wool production is about 2 million tonnes (2.2 million short tons) per year, of which 60% goes into apparel
Wool|sheep|Wool comprises ca 3% of the global textile market, but its value is higher owing to dyeing and other modifications of the material
Wool|sheep|Australia is a leading producer of wool which is mostly from Merino sheep but has been eclipsed by China in terms of total weight
Wool|sheep|New Zealand (2016) is the third-largest producer of wool, and the largest producer of crossbred wool
Wool|sheep|Breeds such as Lincoln, Romney, Drysdale, and Elliotdale produce coarser fibers, and wool from these sheep is usually used for making carpets.
Wool|sheep|In the United States, Texas, New Mexico, and Colorado have large commercial sheep flocks and their mainstay is the Rambouillet (or French Merino)
Wool|sheep|Also, a thriving home-flock contingent of small-scale farmers raise small hobby flocks of specialty sheep for the hand-spinning market
Wool|sheep|These small-scale farmers offer a wide selection of fleece

Wool|sheep|This wool is very limited in supply and much of it comes from New Zealand and Australia
Wool|sheep|It is becoming easier to find in clothing and other products, but these products often carry a higher price
Wool|sheep|Wool is environmentally preferable (as compared to petroleum-based nylon or polypropylene) as a material for carpets, as well, in particular when combined with a natural binding and the use of formaldehyde-free glues.
Wool|sheep|Less than half of New Zealand's wool is sold at auction, while around 45% of farmers sell wool directly to private buyers and end-users.United States sheep producers market wool with private or cooperative wool warehouses, but wool pools are common in many states
Wool|sheep|In some cases, wool is pooled in a local market area, but sold through a wool warehouse
Wool|sheep|Wool offered with objective measurement test results is preferred
Wool|sheep|Imported apparel wool and carpet wool goes directly to central markets, where it is handled by the large merchants and manufacturers.
Wool|sheep|Shoddy or recycled wool is made by cutting or tearing apart existing wool fabric and respinning the resulting fibers
Wool|sheep|As this process makes the wool fibers shorter, the remanufactured fabric is inferior to the original
Wool|sheep|The recycled wool may be mixed with raw wool, wool noil, or another fiber such as cotton to increase the average fiber length
Wool|sheep|Such yarns are typically used as weft yarns with a cotton warp
Wool|sheep|This process was invented in the Heavy Woollen District of West Yorkshire and created a microeconomy in this area for many years.
Wool|sheep|Worsted is a strong, long-staple, combed wool yarn with a hard surface.Woolen is a soft, short-staple, carded wool yarn typically used for knitting
Wool|sheep|In traditional weaving, woolen weft yarn (for softness and warmth) is frequently combined with a worsted warp yarn for strength on the loom.
Wool|sheep|In addition to clothing, wool has been used for blankets, horse rugs, saddle cloths, carpeting, insulation and upholstery
Wool|sheep|Wool felt covers piano hammers, and it is used to absorb odors and noise in heavy machinery and stereo speakers
Wool|sheep|Ancient Greeks lined their helmets with felt, and Roman legionnaires used breastplates made of wool felt.
Wool|sheep|Wool as well as cotton has also been traditionally used for cloth diapers
Wool|sheep|Wool fiber exteriors are hydrophobic (repel water) and the interior of the wool fiber is hygroscopic (attracts water); this makes a wool garment suitable cover for a wet diaper by inhibiting wicking, so outer garments remain dry
Wool|sheep|Wool felted and treated with lanolin is water resistant, air permeable, and slightly antibacterial, so it resists the buildup of odor
Wool|sheep|Some modern cloth diapers use felted wool fabric for covers, and there are several modern commercial knitting patterns for wool diaper covers.
Wool|sheep|Researchers at the Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology school of fashion and textiles have discovered a blend of wool and Kevlar, the synthetic fiber widely used in body armor, was lighter, cheaper and worked better in damp conditions than Kevlar alone
Wool|sheep|Kevlar, when used alone, loses about 20% of its effectiveness when wet, so required an expensive waterproofing process
Wool|sheep|Wool increased friction in a vest with 28–30 layers of fabric, to provide the same level of bullet resistance as 36 layers of Kevlar alone.
Wool|sheep|A buyer of Merino wool, Ermenegildo Zegna, has offered awards for Australian wool producers
Wool|sheep|"In 1963, the first Ermenegildo Zegna Perpetual Trophy was presented in Tasmania for growers of ""Superfine skirted Merino fleece"""
Wool|sheep|In 1980, a national award, the Ermenegildo Zegna Trophy for Extrafine Wool Production, was launched
Wool|sheep|In 2004, this award became known as the Ermenegildo Zegna Unprotected Wool Trophy
Wool|sheep|In 1998, an Ermenegildo Zegna Protected Wool Trophy was launched for fleece from sheep coated for around nine months of the year.
Wool|sheep|In 2002, the Ermenegildo Zegna Vellus Aureum Trophy was launched for wool that is 13.9 microns or finer
Wool|sheep|Wool from Australia, New Zealand, Argentina, and South Africa may enter, and a winner is named from each country
Wool|sheep|In April 2008, New Zealand won the Ermenegildo Zegna Vellus Aureum Trophy for the first time with a fleece that measured 10.8 microns
Wool|sheep|This contest awards the winning fleece weight with the same weight in gold as a prize, hence the name.
Wool|sheep|In 2010, an ultrafine, 10-micron fleece, from Windradeen, near Pyramul, New South Wales, won the Ermenegildo Zegna Vellus Aureum International Trophy.Since 2000, Loro Piana has awarded a cup for the world's finest bale of wool that produces just enough fabric for 50 tailor-made suits
Wool|sheep|The prize is awarded to an Australian or New Zealand wool grower who produces the year's finest bale.The New England Merino Field days which display local studs, wool, and sheep are held during January, in even numbered years around the Walcha, New South Wales district
Wool|sheep|The Annual Wool Fashion Awards, which showcase the use of Merino wool by fashion designers, are hosted by the city of Armidale, New South Wales, in March each year
Wool|sheep|This event encourages young and established fashion designers to display their talents
Wool|sheep|During each May, Armidale hosts the annual New England Wool Expo to display wool fashions, handicrafts, demonstrations, shearing competitions, yard dog trials, and more.In July, the annual Australian Sheep and Wool Show is held in Bendigo, Victoria
Wool|sheep|This is the largest sheep and wool show in the world, with goats and alpacas, as well as woolcraft competitions and displays, fleece competitions, sheepdog trials, shearing, and wool handling
Wool|sheep|The largest competition in the world for objectively measured fleeces is the Australian Fleece Competition, which is held annually at Bendigo
Wool|sheep|In 2008, 475 entries came from all states of Australia, with first and second prizes going to the Northern Tablelands, New South Wales fleeces.

Monkey|monkey|Monkey is a common name that may refer to most mammals of the infraorder Simiiformes, also known as the simians
Monkey|monkey|Traditionally, all animals in the group now known as simians are counted as monkeys except the apes, a grouping known as paraphyletic; however in the broader sense based on cladistics, apes (Hominoidea) are also included, making the terms monkeys and simians synonyms in regard of their scope
Monkey|monkey|Monkeys are divided into the families of New World monkeys (Platyrrhini) and Old World monkeys (Cercopithecidae in the strict sense; Catarrhini in the broad sense, which again includes apes)
Monkey|monkey|Many monkey species are tree-dwelling (arboreal), although there are species that live primarily on the ground, such as baboons
Monkey|monkey|Most species are mainly active during the day (diurnal)
Monkey|monkey|Monkeys are generally considered to be intelligent, especially the Old World monkeys.
Monkey|monkey|Simians and tarsiers, the two members of the suborder Haplorhini, emerged some 60 million years ago
Monkey|monkey|New World monkeys and catarrhine monkeys emerged within the simians some 35 million years ago
Monkey|monkey|Old World monkeys and apes emerged within the catarrhine monkeys some 25 million years ago
Monkey|monkey|Extinct basal simians such as Aegyptopithecus or Parapithecus [35–32 million years ago] are also considered monkeys by primatologists.Lemurs, lorises, and galagos are not monkeys; instead they are strepsirrhine primates (suborder Strepsirrhini)
Monkey|monkey|The simians' sister group, the tarsiers are also haplorhine primates; however, they are also not monkeys.
Monkey|monkey|"Apes emerged within ""monkeys"" as sister of the Cercopithecidae in the Catarrhini, so cladistically they are monkeys as well"
Monkey|monkey|"There has been resistance to directly designate apes (and thus humans) as monkeys, so ""Old World monkey"" may be taken to mean either the Cercopithecoidea (not including apes) or the Catarrhini (including apes)"
Monkey|monkey|That apes are monkeys was already realized by Georges-Louis Leclerc, Comte de Buffon in the 18th century.Monkeys, including apes, can be distinguished from other primates by having only two pectoral nipples, a pendulous penis, and a lack of sensory whiskers.
Monkey|monkey|"According to the Online Etymology Dictionary, the word ""monkey"" may originate in a German version of the Reynard the Fox fable, published circa 1580"
Monkey|monkey|In this version of the fable, a character named Moneke is the son of Martin the Ape
Monkey|monkey|"In English, no clear distinction was originally made between ""ape"" and ""monkey""; thus the 1911 Encyclopædia Britannica entry for ""ape"" notes that it is either a synonym for ""monkey"" or is used to mean a tailless humanlike primate"
Monkey|monkey|"Colloquially, the terms ""monkey"" and ""ape"" are widely used interchangeably"
Monkey|monkey|"Also, a few monkey species have the word ""ape"" in their common name, such as the Barbary ape."
Monkey|monkey|"Later in the first half of the 20th century, the idea developed that there were trends in primate evolution and that the living members of the order could be arranged in a series, leading through ""monkeys"" and ""apes"" to humans"
Monkey|monkey|"Monkeys thus constituted a ""grade"" on the path to humans and were distinguished from ""apes""."
Monkey|monkey|Scientific classifications are now more often based on monophyletic groups, that is groups consisting of all the descendants of a common ancestor
Monkey|monkey|The New World monkeys and the Old World monkeys are each monophyletic groups, but their combination was not, since it excluded hominoids (apes and humans)
Monkey|monkey|"Thus the term ""monkey"" no longer referred to a recognized scientific taxon"
Monkey|monkey|The smallest accepted taxon which contains all the monkeys is the infraorder Simiiformes, or simians
Monkey|monkey|However this also contains the hominoids, so that monkeys are, in terms of currently recognized taxa, non-hominoid simians
Monkey|monkey|Colloquially and pop-culturally, the term is ambiguous and sometimes monkey includes non-human hominoids
Monkey|monkey|"In addition, frequent arguments are made for a monophyletic usage of the word ""monkey"" from the perspective that usage should reflect cladistics.A group of monkeys may be commonly referred to as a tribe or a troop.Two separate groups of primates are referred to as ""monkeys"""
Monkey|monkey|New World monkeys (platyrrhines) from South and Central America and Old World monkeys (catarrhines in the superfamily Cercopithecoidea) from Africa and Asia
Monkey|monkey|Apes (hominoids)—consisting of gibbons, orangutans, gorillas, chimpanzees, and humans—are also catarrhines but were classically distinguished from monkeys
Monkey|monkey|"Tailless monkeys may be called ""apes"", incorrectly according to modern usage; thus the tailless Barbary macaque is historically called the ""Barbary ape""."
Monkey|monkey|As apes have emerged in the monkey group as sister of the old world monkeys, characteristics that describe monkeys are generally shared by apes as well
Monkey|monkey|Williams et al outlined evolutionary features, including in stem groupings, contrasted against the other primates such as the tarsiers and the lemuriformes.Monkeys range in size from the pygmy marmoset, which can be as small as 117 millimetres (4.6 in) with a 172-millimetre (6.8 in) tail and just over 100 grams (3.5 oz) in weight, to the male mandrill, almost 1 metre (3.3 ft) long and weighing up to 36 kilograms (79 lb)
Monkey|monkey|Some are arboreal (living in trees) while others live on the savanna; diets differ among the various species but may contain any of the following
Monkey|monkey|fruit, leaves, seeds, nuts, flowers, eggs and small animals (including insects and spiders).Some characteristics are shared among the groups; most New World monkeys have prehensile tails while Old World monkeys have non-prehensile tails or no visible tail at all
Monkey|monkey|Old World monkeys have trichromatic color vision like that of humans, while New World monkeys may be trichromatic, dichromatic, or—as in the owl monkeys and greater galagos—monochromatic
Monkey|monkey|Although both the New and Old World monkeys, like the apes, have forward-facing eyes, the faces of Old World and New World monkeys look very different, though again, each group shares some features such as the types of noses, cheeks and rumps.

Monkey|monkey|Below is a cladogram with some extinct monkey families
Monkey|monkey|Generally, extinct non-hominoid simians, including early catarrhines are discussed as monkeys as well as simians or anthropoids, which cladistically means that Hominoidea are monkeys as well, restoring monkeys as a single grouping
Monkey|monkey|It is indicated approximately how many million years ago (Mya) the clades diverged into newer clades
Monkey|monkey|"It is thought the New World monkeys started as a drifted ""Old World monkey"" group from the Old World (probably Africa) to the New World (South America)."
Monkey|monkey|The many species of monkey have varied relationships with humans
Monkey|monkey|Some are kept as pets, others used as model organisms in laboratories or in space missions
Monkey|monkey|They may be killed in monkey drives (when they threaten agriculture) or used as service animals for the disabled.
Monkey|monkey|In some areas, some species of monkey are considered agricultural pests, and can cause extensive damage to commercial and subsistence crops
Monkey|monkey|This can have important implications for the conservation of endangered species, which may be subject to persecution
Monkey|monkey|In some instances farmers' perceptions of the damage may exceed the actual damage
Monkey|monkey|Monkeys that have become habituated to human presence in tourist locations may also be considered pests, attacking tourists.In popular culture monkeys are a symbol of playfulness, mischief and fun.
Monkey|monkey|Some organizations train capuchin monkeys as service animals to assist quadriplegics and other people with severe spinal cord injuries or mobility impairments
Monkey|monkey|After being socialized in a human home as infants, the monkeys undergo extensive training before being placed with disabled people
Monkey|monkey|Around the house, the monkeys assist with daily tasks such as feeding, fetching, manipulating objects, and personal care.Helper monkeys are usually trained in schools by private organizations, taking seven years to train, and are able to serve 25–30 years (two to three times longer than a guide dog).In 2010, the U.S
Monkey|monkey|federal government revised its definition of service animal under the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA)
Monkey|monkey|Non-human primates are no longer recognized as service animals under the ADA
Monkey|monkey|The American Veterinary Medical Association does not support the use of non-human primates as assistance animals because of animal welfare concerns, the potential for serious injury to people, and risks that primates may transfer dangerous diseases to humans.
Monkey|monkey|The most common monkey species found in animal research are the grivet, the rhesus macaque, and the crab-eating macaque, which are either wild-caught or purpose-bred
Monkey|monkey|They are used primarily because of their relative ease of handling, their fast reproductive cycle (compared to apes) and their psychological and physical similarity to humans
Monkey|monkey|Worldwide, it is thought that between 100,000 and 200,000 non-human primates are used in research each year, 64.7% of which are Old World monkeys,
Monkey|monkey|and 5.5% New World monkeys
Monkey|monkey|This number makes a very small fraction of all animals used in research
Monkey|monkey|Between 1994 and 2004 the United States has used an average of 54,000 non-human primates, while around 10,000 non-human primates were used in the European Union in 2002.
Monkey|monkey|A number of countries have used monkeys as part of their space exploration programmes, including the United States and France
Monkey|monkey|The first monkey in space was Albert II, who flew in the US-launched V-2 rocket on June 14, 1949.
Monkey|monkey|Monkey brains are eaten as a delicacy in parts of South Asia, Africa and China
Monkey|monkey|"Monkeys are sometimes eaten in parts of Africa, where they can be sold as ""bushmeat"""
Monkey|monkey|In traditional Islamic dietary laws, the eating of monkeys is forbidden.
Monkey|monkey|Monkeys are prevalent in numerous books, television programs, and movies
Monkey|monkey|The television series Monkey and the literary characters Monsieur Eek and Curious George are all examples.
Monkey|monkey|"Informally, ""monkey"" may refer to apes, particularly chimpanzees, gibbons, and gorillas"
Monkey|monkey|Author Terry Pratchett alludes to this difference in usage in his Discworld novels, in which the Librarian of the Unseen University is an orangutan who gets very violent if referred to as a monkey
Monkey|monkey|Another example is the use of Simians in Chinese poetry.
Monkey|monkey|The winged monkeys are prominent characters in L
Monkey|monkey|Frank Baum's Wizard of Oz books and in the 1939 film based on Baum's 1900 novel The Wonderful Wizard of Oz.
Monkey|monkey|In Buddhism, the monkey is an early incarnation of Buddha but may also represent trickery and ugliness
Monkey|monkey|"The Chinese Buddhist ""mind monkey"" metaphor refers to the unsettled, restless state of human mind"
Monkey|monkey|Monkey is also one of the Three Senseless Creatures, symbolizing greed, with the tiger representing anger and the deer lovesickness.
Monkey|monkey|"The Sanzaru, or three wise monkeys, are revered in Japanese folklore; together they embody the proverbial principle to ""see no evil, hear no evil, speak no evil"".The Moche people of ancient Peru worshipped nature"
Monkey|monkey|They placed emphasis on animals and often depicted monkeys in their art.The Tzeltal people of Mexico worshipped monkeys as incarnations of their dead ancestors.
Monkey|monkey|The Monkey (猴) is the ninth in the twelve-year cycle of animals which appear in the Chinese zodiac related to the Chinese calendar
Monkey|monkey|The next time that the monkey will appear as the zodiac sign will be in the year 2028.

Monkey Day|monkey|Monkey Day is an unofficial international holiday celebrated on December 14
Monkey Day|monkey|The holiday was created and popularized in 2000 by artists Casey Sorrow and Eric Millikin when they were art students at Michigan State University
Monkey Day|monkey|"Monkey Day celebrates monkeys and ""all things simian"", including other non-human primates such as apes, tarsiers, and lemurs"
Monkey Day|monkey|Monkey Day is celebrated worldwide and often also known as World Monkey Day and International Monkey Day.
Monkey Day|monkey|Michigan State University
Monkey Day|monkey|Sorrow jokingly scribbled Monkey Day on a friend's calendar, and then they first celebrated the holiday with other MSU art students
Monkey Day|monkey|The holiday gained notoriety when Sorrow and Millikin began including Monkey Day in their artwork and alternative comics that they published online and exhibited internationally along with other artists.Since then, Monkey Day has been widely celebrated across countries such as the United States, Canada, Italy, India, Pakistan, Estonia, the United Kingdom, Colombia, Thailand, and Turkey
Monkey Day|monkey|"Hallmark Cards describes the holiday as a ""day when monkey business is actually encouraged."" The Washington Post describes Monkey Day as a day to ""learn something about these adorable and highly intelligent primates"
Monkey Day|monkey|"Or you could use this day to act like a monkey.""Monkey Day is particularly popular among animal rights and environmental activists, and visual artists and art institutions"
Monkey Day|monkey|Monkey Day's celebrants and supporters include Jane Goodall, Greenpeace, National Geographic, the National Portrait Gallery in London, the Louvre Museum, the Metropolitan Museum of Art, and the Smithsonian Institution.
Monkey Day|monkey|Many zoos hold annual Monkey Day events
Monkey Day|monkey|For example, the Lahore Zoo in Pakistan holds an annual World Monkey Day celebration that includes art competitions and educational events about monkeys, including over a hundred children wearing monkey masks, poetry readings about monkeys, and performances to highlight the threats monkeys face as well as monkey evolution
Monkey Day|monkey|The Tallinn Zoo in Estonia celebrates Monkey Day by auctioning artwork created by chimpanzees and performing intelligence tests on Japanese macaques
Monkey Day|monkey|The Indira Gandhi Zoological Park in India organizes Monkey Day programs to educate children about wildlife issues and encourage people to adopt monkeys

Monkey Day|monkey|Since 2009, the Colombian Association Primatological APC (for its acronym in Spanish) has celebrated Monkey Day
Monkey Day|monkey|During the week of Monkey Day, the National Zoo & Aquarium in Australia holds a range of activities and educational talks, raising awareness for all primates and raising money for conserving critically endangered species like Cotton-top Tamarins in Columbia.
Monkey Day|monkey|"Prominent artists like Sorrow, Millikin, Rob Balder, and David Malki have created Monkey Day themed comics and artwork.For Monkey Day 2012, USA Weekend published The 12 Stars of Monkey Day, a series of paintings by Millikin that were ""in part inspired by the many pioneering space monkeys who rode into the stars on rockets, leading the way for human space flight."" In 2013, Eric Millikin created a mail art series where he mailed Monkey Day cards to strangers, including Koko the sign-language gorilla and President Barack Obama"
Monkey Day|monkey|For Monkey Day 2014, Millikin created a 3D monkey experience
Monkey Day|monkey|"Since 2016, Millikin has created the Danger Beast series of street art portraits of endangered animals created out of endangered plants, including a portrait of Harambe the gorilla made from Venus flytraps.In addition to his monkey-themed artwork, Sorrow also maintains a  comprehensive ""Monkeys in the News"" blog with stories on topics like monkey attacks, monkey smuggling, and monkey science"

New World monkey|monkey|New World monkeys are the five families of primates that are found in the tropical regions of Mexico, Central and South America
New World monkey|monkey|Callitrichidae, Cebidae, Aotidae, Pitheciidae, and Atelidae
New World monkey|monkey|The five families are ranked together as the Ceboidea , the only extant superfamily in the parvorder Platyrrhini .Platyrrhini means broad-nosed, and their noses are flatter than those of other simians, with sideways-facing nostrils
New World monkey|monkey|Monkeys in the family Atelidae, such as the spider monkey, are the only primates to have prehensile tails
New World monkey|monkey|"New World monkeys' closest relatives are the other simians, the Catarrhini (""down-nosed""), comprising Old World monkeys and apes"
New World monkey|monkey|New World monkeys descend from African simians that colonized South America, a line that split off about 40 million years ago.
New World monkey|monkey|About 40 million years ago, the Simiiformes infraorder split into the parvorders Platyrrhini (New World monkeys—in South America) and Catarrhini (apes and Old World monkeys—in Africa)
New World monkey|monkey|The individuals whose descendants would become Platyrrhini are currently conjectured to have migrated to South America either on a raft of vegetation or via a land bridge
New World monkey|monkey|There are two possible rafting routes, either across the Atlantic Ocean from Africa or across the Caribbean from North America; however, there is no fossil record to support the hypothesis of a migration from North America
New World monkey|monkey|The land bridge hypothesis relies on the existence of Atlantic Ocean ridges and a fall in the sea level in the Oligocene
New World monkey|monkey|This would have produced either a single land bridge or a series of mid-Atlantic islands to act as stepping stones for the migration
New World monkey|monkey|The latter is now the favoured land bridge hypothesis.At the time the New World monkeys split off, the Isthmus of Panama had not yet formed, ocean currents and climate were quite different, and the Atlantic Ocean was less than the present 2,800 km (1,700 mi) width by about a third; possibly 1,000 km (600 mi) less, based on the current estimate of the Atlantic mid-ocean ridge formation processes spreading rate of 25 millimetres per year (1 in/year).However, the Ucayalipithecus of Amazonian Peru who might have rafted across the Atlantic between ~35–32 million years ago, are nested within the Parapithecoidea from the Eocene of Afro-Arabia.The chromosomal content of the ancestor species appears to have been 2n = 54
New World monkey|monkey|In extant species, the 2n value varies from 16 in the titi monkey to 62 in the woolly monkey.

New World monkey|monkey|Old World monkeys, apes, and humans
New World monkey|monkey|New World monkeys are small to mid-sized primates, ranging from the pygmy marmoset (the world's smallest monkey), at 14 to 16 cm (5.5 to 6.5 in) and a weight of 120 to 190 g (4.2 to 6.7 oz), to the southern muriqui, at 55 to 70 cm (22 to 28 in) and a weight of 12 to 15 kg (26 to 33 lb)
New World monkey|monkey|New World monkeys differ slightly from Old World monkeys in several aspects
New World monkey|monkey|The most prominent phenotypic distinction is the nose, which is the feature used most commonly to distinguish between the two groups
New World monkey|monkey|"The clade for the New World monkeys, Platyrrhini, means ""flat nosed"""
New World monkey|monkey|The noses of New World monkeys are flatter than the narrow noses of the Old World monkeys, and have side-facing nostrils.
New World monkey|monkey|New World monkeys are the only monkeys with prehensile tails—in comparison with the shorter, non-grasping tails of the anthropoids of the Old World
New World monkey|monkey|Prehensility has evolved at least two distinct times in platyrrhines, in the Atelidae family (spider monkeys, wooly spider monkeys, howler monkeys, and wooly monkeys), and in capuchin monkeys (Cebus)
New World monkey|monkey|Although prehensility is present in all of these primate species, skeletal and muscular-based morphological differences between these two groups indicate that the trait evolved separately through convergent evolution
New World monkey|monkey|The fully prehensile tails that have evolved in Atelidae allow the primates to suspend their entire body weight by only their tails, with arms and legs free for other foraging and locomotive activities
New World monkey|monkey|Semi-prehensile tails in Cebus can be used for balance by wrapping the tail around branches and supporting a large portion of their weight.New World monkeys (except for the howler monkeys of genus Alouatta) also typically lack the trichromatic vision of Old World monkeys
New World monkey|monkey|Colour vision in New World primates relies on a single gene on the X-chromosome to produce pigments that absorb medium and long wavelength light, which contrasts with short wavelength light
New World monkey|monkey|As a result, males rely on a single medium/long pigment gene and are dichromatic, as are homozygous females
New World monkey|monkey|Heterozygous females may possess two alleles with different sensitivities within this range, and so can display trichromatic vision.Platyrrhines also differ from Old World monkeys in that they have twelve premolars instead of eight; having a dental formula of 2.1.3.32.1.3.3 or 2.1.3.22.1.3.2 (consisting of 2 incisors, 1 canine, 3 premolars, and 2 or 3 molars)
New World monkey|monkey|This is in contrast with Old World Anthropoids, including gorillas, chimpanzees, bonobos, siamangs, gibbons, orangutans, and most humans, which share a dental formula of 2.1.2.32.1.2.3
New World monkey|monkey|Many New World monkeys are small and almost all are arboreal, so knowledge of them is less comprehensive than that of the more easily observed Old World monkeys
New World monkey|monkey|Unlike most Old World monkeys, many New World monkeys form monogamous pair bonds, and show substantial paternal care of young
New World monkey|monkey|They eat fruits, nuts, insects, flowers, bird eggs, spiders, and small mammals
New World monkey|monkey|Unlike humans and most Old World monkeys, their thumbs are not opposable (except for some Cebids).

Old World monkey|monkey|Old World monkey is the common English name for a family of primates known taxonomically as the Cercopithecidae 
Old World monkey|monkey|Twenty-four genera and 138 species are recognized, making it the largest primate family
Old World monkey|monkey|Old World monkey genera include baboons (genus Papio), red colobus (genus Piliocolobus) and macaques (genus Macaca)
Old World monkey|monkey|Common names for other Old World monkeys include the talapoin, guenon, colobus, douc (douc langur, genus Pygathrix), vervet, gelada, mangabey (a group of genera), langur, mandrill, surili (Presbytis), patas, and proboscis monkey
Old World monkey|monkey|Phylogenetically, they are more closely related to apes than to New World monkeys
Old World monkey|monkey|They diverged from a common ancestor of New World monkeys around 45 to 55 million years ago.The smallest Old World monkey is the talapoin, with a head and body 34–37 cm in length, and weighing between 0.7 and 1.3 kg
Old World monkey|monkey|The largest is the male mandrill,  around 70 cm in length, and weighing up to 50 kg
Old World monkey|monkey|Old World monkeys have a variety of  facial features; some have snouts, some are flat nosed, and many exhibit coloration
Old World monkey|monkey|Most have tails, but they are not prehensile.
Old World monkey|monkey|Old World monkeys are native to Africa and Asia today, inhabiting numerous environments
Old World monkey|monkey|tropical rain forests,  savannas, shrublands, and mountainous terrain
Old World monkey|monkey|They inhabited much of Europe in the past; today, the only survivors in Europe are the Barbary macaques of Gibraltar
Old World monkey|monkey|Whether they are native to Gibraltar or were brought by humans is unknown
Old World monkey|monkey|Some Old World monkeys are arboreal, such as the colobus monkeys; others are terrestrial, such as the baboons
Old World monkey|monkey|Most are at least partially omnivorous, but all prefer plant matter, which forms the bulk of their diets
Old World monkey|monkey|Most are highly opportunistic, primarily eating fruit, but also consuming almost any food items available, such as flowers, leaves, bulbs and rhizomes, insects, snails, small mammals, and garbage and handouts from humans.
Old World monkey|monkey|Family Cercopithecidae
Old World monkey|monkey|Old World monkeys
Old World monkey|monkey|The distinction between apes and monkeys is complicated by the traditional paraphyly of monkeys
Old World monkey|monkey|Apes emerged as a sister group of Old World monkeys in the catarrhines, which are a sister group of New World monkeys
Old World monkey|monkey|"Therefore, cladistically, apes, catarrhines and related contemporary extinct groups, such as Parapithecidae, are monkeys as well, for any consistent definition of ""monkey""."
Old World monkey|monkey|Old World monkeys are medium to large in size, and range from arboreal forms, such as the colobus monkeys, to fully terrestrial forms, such as the baboons
Old World monkey|monkey|"The smallest is the talapoin, with a head and body 34–37 cm in length, and weighing between 0.7 and 1.3 kilograms, while the largest is the male mandrill (the females of the species being significantly smaller), at around 70 cm in length, and weighing up to 50 kilograms.Most Old World monkeys have tails (the family name means ""tailed ape""), unlike the tailless apes"
Old World monkey|monkey|The tails of Old World monkeys are not prehensile, as are those of the New World monkeys (platyrrhines).
Old World monkey|monkey|The distinction of catarrhines from platyrrhines depends on the structure of the rhinarium, and the distinction of Old World monkeys from apes depends on dentition (the number of teeth is the same in both, but they are shaped differently)
Old World monkey|monkey|In platyrrhines, the nostrils face sideways, while in catarrhines, they face downward
Old World monkey|monkey|Other distinctions include both a tubular ectotympanic (ear bone), and eight, not twelve, premolars in catarrhines, giving them a dental formula of
Old World monkey|monkey|2.1.2.32.1.2.3
Old World monkey|monkey|Several Old World monkeys have anatomical oddities
Old World monkey|monkey|For example, the colobus monkeys have stubs for thumbs to assist with their arboreal movement, the proboscis monkey has an extraordinary nose, while the snub-nosed monkeys have almost no nose at all.
Old World monkey|monkey|The penis of the male mandrill is red and the scrotum is lilac; the face is also brightly colored
Old World monkey|monkey|The coloration is more pronounced in dominant males.
Old World monkey|monkey|The Old World monkeys are native to Africa and Asia today, inhabiting numerous environments
Old World monkey|monkey|tropical rain forests,  savannas, shrublands, and mountainous terrain
Old World monkey|monkey|They inhabited much of Europe during the Neogene period; today the only survivors in Europe are the Barbary macaques of Gibraltar.
Old World monkey|monkey|Most Old World monkeys are at least partially omnivorous, but all prefer plant matter, which forms the bulk of their diet
Old World monkey|monkey|Leaf monkeys are the most vegetarian, subsisting primarily on leaves, and eating only a small number of insects, while the other species are highly opportunistic, primarily eating fruit, but also consuming almost any food items available, such as flowers, leaves, bulbs and rhizomes, insects, snails, and even small vertebrates
Old World monkey|monkey|The Barbary macaque's diet consists mostly of leaves and roots, though it will also eat insects and uses cedar trees as a water source.
Old World monkey|monkey|Gestation in the Old World monkeys lasts between five and seven months
Old World monkey|monkey|Births are usually single, although, as with humans, twins occur occasionally
Old World monkey|monkey|The young are born relatively well-developed, and are able to cling onto their mother's fur with their hands from birth
Old World monkey|monkey|Compared with most other mammals, they take a long time to reach sexual maturity, with four to six years being typical of most species.
Old World monkey|monkey|In most species, daughters remain with their mothers for life, so that the basic social group among Old World monkeys is a matrilineal troop
Old World monkey|monkey|Males leave the group on reaching adolescence, and find a new troop to join
Old World monkey|monkey|In many species, only a single adult male lives with each group, driving off all rivals, but others are more tolerant, establishing hierarchical relationships between dominant and subordinate males
Old World monkey|monkey|Group sizes are highly variable, even within species, depending on the availability of food and other resources.
Signifying monkey|monkey|The signifying monkey is a character of African-American folklore that derives from the trickster figure of Yoruba mythology, Esu Elegbara
Signifying monkey|monkey|This character was transported with Africans to the Americas under the names of Exu, Echu-Elegua, Papa Legba, and Papa Le Bas
Signifying monkey|monkey|Esu and his variants all serve as messengers who mediated between the gods and men by means of tricks
Signifying monkey|monkey|"The signifying monkey is ""distinctly Afro-American"" but is thought to derive from Yoruban mythology, which depicts Echu-Elegua with a monkey at his side.Numerous songs and narratives concern the signifying monkey and his interactions with his friends, the lion and the elephant"
Signifying monkey|monkey|In general, the stories depict the signifying monkey insulting the lion, but claiming that he is only repeating the elephant's words
Signifying monkey|monkey|The lion then confronts the elephant, who in turn physically assaults the lion
Signifying monkey|monkey|The lion later realizes that the monkey has been signifyin' and has duped the lion, and as a result the lion angrily returns to castrate the monkey and rendering him unable to reproduce.

Chicken|chicken|The chicken (Gallus gallus domesticus) is a domesticated subspecies of the red junglefowl originally from Southeastern Asia
Chicken|chicken|Rooster or cock is a term for an adult male bird, and a younger male may be called a cockerel
Chicken|chicken|A male that has been castrated is a capon
Chicken|chicken|An adult female bird is called a hen and a sexually immature female is called a pullet.
Chicken|chicken|Originally raised for cockfighting or for special ceremonies, chickens were not kept for food until the Hellenistic period (4th–2nd centuries BC)
Chicken|chicken|Humans now keep chickens primarily as a source of food (consuming both their meat and eggs) and as pets.
Chicken|chicken|Chickens are one of the most common and widespread domestic animals, with a total population of 23.7 billion as of 2018, up from more than 19 billion in 2011
Chicken|chicken|There are more chickens in the world than any other bird
Chicken|chicken|There are numerous cultural references to chickens – in myth, folklore and religion, and in language and literature.
Chicken|chicken|Genetic studies have pointed to multiple maternal origins in South Asia, Southeast Asia, and East Asia, but the clade found in the Americas, Europe, the Middle East and Africa originated from the Indian subcontinent
Chicken|chicken|From ancient India, the chicken spread to Lydia in western Asia Minor, and to Greece by the 5th century BC
Chicken|chicken|"Fowl have been known in Egypt since the mid-15th century BC, with the ""bird that gives birth every day"" having come from the land between Syria and Shinar, Babylonia, according to the annals of Thutmose III."

Chicken|chicken|a chicken (Australia, informal)
Chicken|chicken|'Pullet:' a young female chicken less than a year old
Chicken|chicken|In the poultry industry, a pullet is a sexually immature chicken less than 22 weeks of age.
Chicken|chicken|"'Yardbird:' a chicken (southern United States, dialectal)""Chicken"" was originally a term only for an immature, or at least young, bird"
Chicken|chicken|However, thanks to its usage on restaurant menus, it has now become the most common term for the subspecies in general, especially in American English
Chicken|chicken|In older sources, 'chicken' as a species were typically referred to as 'common fowl' or 'domestic fowl'.'Chicken' may also mean a 'chick' (see for example Hen and Chicken Islands).
Chicken|chicken|"According to Merriam-Webster, the term ""rooster"" (i.e"
Chicken|chicken|"a roosting bird) originated in the mid- or late 18th century as a euphemism to avoid the sexual connotation of the original English ""cock"", and is widely used throughout North America"
Chicken|chicken|"""Roosting"" is the action of perching aloft to sleep at night."
Chicken|chicken|Chickens are omnivores
Chicken|chicken|In the wild, they often scratch at the soil to search for seeds, insects and even animals as large as lizards, small snakes, or sometimes young mice.The average chicken may live for 5-10 years, depending on the breed
Chicken|chicken|The world's oldest known chicken lived 16 years according to Guinness World Records.
Chicken|chicken|Roosters can usually be differentiated from hens by their striking plumage of long flowing tails and shiny, pointed feathers on their necks ('hackles') and backs ('saddle'), which are typically of brighter, bolder colours than those of females of the same breed
Chicken|chicken|However, in some breeds, such as the Sebright chicken, the rooster has only slightly pointed neck feathers, the same colour as the hen's
Chicken|chicken|The identification can be made by looking at the comb, or eventually from the development of spurs on the male's legs (in a few breeds and in certain hybrids, the male and female chicks may be differentiated by colour)
Chicken|chicken|Adult chickens have a fleshy crest on their heads called a comb, or cockscomb, and hanging flaps of skin either side under their beaks called wattles
Chicken|chicken|Collectively, these and other fleshy protuberances on the head and throat are called caruncles
Chicken|chicken|Both the adult male and female have wattles and combs, but in most breeds these are more prominent in males.
Chicken|chicken|A 'muff' or 'beard' is a mutation found in several chicken breeds which causes extra feathering under the chicken's face, giving the appearance of a beard.Domestic chickens are not capable of long-distance flight, although lighter chickens are generally capable of flying for short distances, such as over fences or into trees (where they would naturally roost)
Chicken|chicken|Chickens may occasionally fly briefly to explore their surroundings, but generally do so only to flee perceived danger.
Chicken|chicken|Chickens are gregarious birds and live together in flocks
Chicken|chicken|They have a communal approach to the incubation of eggs and raising of young
Chicken|chicken|"Individual chickens in a flock will dominate others, establishing a ""pecking order"", with dominant individuals having priority for food access and nesting locations"
Chicken|chicken|Removing hens or roosters from a flock causes a temporary disruption to this social order until a new pecking order is established
Chicken|chicken|Adding hens, especially younger birds, to an existing flock can lead to fighting and injury.When a rooster finds food, he may call other chickens to eat first
Chicken|chicken|He does this by clucking in a high pitch as well as picking up and dropping the food
Chicken|chicken|This behaviour may also be observed in mother hens to call their chicks and encourage them to eat.
Chicken|chicken|A rooster's crowing is a loud and sometimes shrill call and sends a territorial signal to other roosters
Chicken|chicken|However, roosters may also crow in response to sudden disturbances within their surroundings
Chicken|chicken|Hens cluck loudly after laying an egg, and also to call their chicks
Chicken|chicken|Chickens also give different warning calls when they sense a predator approaching from the air or on the ground.
Chicken|chicken|Roosters almost always start crowing before four months of age
Chicken|chicken|Although it is possible for a hen to crow as well, crowing (together with hackles development) is one of the clearest signs of being a rooster.
Chicken|chicken|Rooster crowing contests, also known as crowing contests, are a traditional sport in several countries, such as Germany, the Netherlands, Belgium, the United States, Indonesia and Japan
Chicken|chicken|The oldest contests are held with longcrowers
Chicken|chicken|Depending on the breed, either the duration of the crowing or the times the rooster crows within a certain time is measured.
Chicken|chicken|"To initiate courting, some roosters may dance in a circle around or near a hen (""a circle dance""), often lowering the wing which is closest to the hen"
Chicken|chicken|"The dance triggers a response in the hen and when she responds to his ""call"", the rooster may mount the hen and proceed with the mating."
Chicken|chicken|Hens will often try to lay in nests that already contain eggs and have been known to move eggs from neighbouring nests into their own
Chicken|chicken|The result of this behaviour is that a flock will use only a few preferred locations, rather than having a different nest for every bird
Chicken|chicken|Hens will often express a preference to lay in the same location
Chicken|chicken|It is not unknown for two (or more) hens to try to share the same nest at the same time
Chicken|chicken|If the nest is small, or one of the hens is particularly determined, this may result in chickens trying to lay on top of each other
Chicken|chicken|There is evidence that individual hens prefer to be either solitary or gregarious nesters.
Chicken|chicken|Under natural conditions, most birds lay only until a clutch is complete, and they will then incubate all the eggs
Chicken|chicken|"Hens are then said to ""go broody"""
Chicken|chicken|The broody hen will stop laying and instead will focus on the incubation of the eggs (a full clutch is usually about 12 eggs)
Chicken|chicken|"She will ""sit"" or ""set"" on the nest, fluff up or pecking in defense if disturbed or removed"
Chicken|chicken|The hen will rarely leave the nest to eat, drink, or dust-bathe
Chicken|chicken|While brooding, the hen maintains the nest at a constant temperature and humidity, as well as turning the eggs regularly during the first part of the incubation
Chicken|chicken|To stimulate broodiness, owners may place several artificial eggs in the nest
Chicken|chicken|To discourage it, they may place the hen in an elevated cage with an open wire floor.
Chicken|chicken|Breeds artificially developed for egg production rarely go broody, and those that do often stop part-way through the incubation
Chicken|chicken|However, other breeds, such as the Cochin, Cornish and Silkie, do regularly go broody, and make excellent mothers, not only for chicken eggs but also for those of other species — even those with much smaller or larger eggs and different incubation periods, such as quail, pheasants, ducks, turkeys, or geese.
Chicken|chicken|Fertile chicken eggs hatch at the end of the incubation period, about 21 days
Chicken|chicken|Development of the chick starts only when incubation begins, so all chicks hatch within a day or two of each other, despite perhaps being laid over a period of two weeks or so
Chicken|chicken|Before hatching, the hen can hear the chicks peeping inside the eggs, and will gently cluck to stimulate them to break out of their shells
Chicken|chicken|"The chick begins by ""pipping""; pecking a breathing hole with its egg tooth towards the blunt end of the egg, usually on the upper side"
Chicken|chicken|The chick then rests for some hours, absorbing the remaining egg yolk and withdrawing the blood supply from the membrane beneath the shell (used earlier for breathing through the shell)
Chicken|chicken|The chick then enlarges the hole, gradually turning round as it goes, and eventually severing the blunt end of the shell completely to make a lid
Chicken|chicken|The chick crawls out of the remaining shell, and the wet down dries out in the warmth of the nest.
Chicken|chicken|Hens usually remain on the nest for about two days after the first chick hatches, and during this time the newly hatched chicks feed by absorbing the internal yolk sac
Chicken|chicken|Some breeds sometimes start eating cracked eggs, which can become habitual
Chicken|chicken|Hens fiercely guard their chicks, and brood them when necessary to keep them warm, at first often returning to the nest at night
Chicken|chicken|She leads them to food and water and will call them toward edible items, but seldom feeds them directly
Chicken|chicken|She continues to care for them until they are several weeks old.
Chicken|chicken|Chickens may occasionally gang up on a weak or inexperienced predator
Chicken|chicken|At least one credible report exists of a young fox killed by hens
Chicken|chicken|A group of hens have been recorded in attacking a hawk that had entered their coop.If a chicken is threatened by predators, stress, or is sick, there is a chance that they will puff up their feathers.
Chicken|chicken|"Sperm transfer occurs by cloacal contact between the male and female, in a maneuver known as the ""cloacal kiss"""
Chicken|chicken|As with birds in general, reproduction is controlled by a neuroendocrine system, the Gonadotropin-Releasing Hormone-I neurons in the hypothalamus
Chicken|chicken|Locally to the reproductive system itself, reproductive hormones such as estrogen, progesterone, gonadotropins (luteinizing hormone and follicle-stimulating hormone) initiate and maintain sexual maturation changes
Chicken|chicken|Over time there is reproductive decline, thought to be due to GnRH-I-N decline
Chicken|chicken|Because there is significant inter-individual variability in egg-producing duration, it is believed to be possible to breed for further extended useful lifetime in egg-layers.
Chicken|chicken|Chicken embryos have long been used as model systems to study developing embryos
Chicken|chicken|Large numbers of embryos can be provided by commercial chicken farmers who sell fertilized eggs which can be easily opened and used to observe the developing embryo
Chicken|chicken|Equally important, embryologists can carry out experiments on such embryos, close the egg again and study the effect later on
Chicken|chicken|For instance, many important discoveries in the area of limb development have been made using chicken embryos, such as the discovery of the apical ectodermal ridge (AER) and the zone of polarizing activity (ZPA) by John W
Chicken|chicken|"Saunders.In 2006, scientists researching the ancestry of birds ""turned on"" a chicken recessive gene, talpid2, and found that the embryo jaws initiated formation of teeth, like those found in ancient bird fossils"
Chicken|chicken|"John Fallon, the overseer of the project, stated that chickens have ""...retained the ability to make teeth, under certain conditions.."
Chicken|chicken|"."""
Chicken|chicken|Given its eminent role in farming, meat production, but also research, the house chicken was the first bird genome to be sequenced
Chicken|chicken|At 1.21 Gb, the chicken genome is considerably smaller than other vertebrate genomes, such as the human genome (3 Gb)
Chicken|chicken|The final gene set contained 26,640 genes (including noncoding genes and pseudogenes), with a total of 19,119 protein-coding genes in annotation release 103 (2017), a similar number of protein-coding genes as in the human genome.
Chicken|chicken|Populations of chickens from high altitude regions like Tibet have special physiological adaptations that result in a higher hatching rate in low oxygen environments
Chicken|chicken|When eggs are placed in a hypoxic environment, chicken embryos from these populations express much more hemoglobin than embryos from other chicken populations
Chicken|chicken|This hemoglobin also has a greater affinity for oxygen, allowing hemoglobin to bind to oxygen more readily.Pinopsins were originally discovered in the chicken pineal gland.
Chicken|chicken|Galliformes, the order of bird that chickens belong to, is directly linked to the survival of birds when all other dinosaurs went extinct
Chicken|chicken|Water or ground-dwelling fowl, similar to modern partridges, survived the Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event that killed all tree-dwelling birds and dinosaurs
Chicken|chicken|Some of these evolved into the modern galliformes, of which domesticated chickens are a main model
Chicken|chicken|They are descended primarily from the red junglefowl (Gallus gallus) and are scientifically classified as the same species
Chicken|chicken|As such, domesticated chickens can and do freely interbreed with populations of red junglefowl
Chicken|chicken|Subsequent hybridization of the domestic chicken with grey junglefowl, Sri Lankan junglefowl and green junglefowl occurred; a gene for yellow skin, for instance, was incorporated into domestic birds through hybridization with the grey junglefowl (G
Chicken|chicken|sonneratii)
Chicken|chicken|In a study published in 2020, it was found that chickens shared between 71% - 79% of their genome with red junglefowl, with the period of domestication dated to 8,000 years ago.
Chicken|chicken|The traditional view is that chickens were first domesticated for cockfighting in Asia, Africa, and Europe
Chicken|chicken|In the last decade, there have been a number of genetic studies to clarify the origins
Chicken|chicken|According to one early study, a single domestication event of the red junglefowl in what now is the country of Thailand gave rise to the modern chicken with minor transitions separating the modern breeds
Chicken|chicken|The red junglefowl, known as the bamboo fowl in many Southeast Asian languages, is well adapted to take advantage of the vast quantities of seed produced during the end of the multi-decade bamboo seeding cycle, to boost its own reproduction
Chicken|chicken|In domesticating the chicken, humans took advantage of this predisposition for prolific reproduction of the red junglefowl when exposed to large amounts of food.Exactly when and where the chicken was domesticated remains a controversial issue
Chicken|chicken|Genomic studies estimate that the chicken was domesticated 8,000 years ago in Southeast Asia and spread to China and India 2000–3000 years later
Chicken|chicken|Archaeological evidence supports domestic chickens in Southeast Asia well before 6000 BC, China by 6000 BC and India by 2000 BC
Chicken|chicken|A landmark 2020 Nature study that fully sequenced 863 chickens across the world suggests that all domestic chickens originate from a single domestication event of red junglefowl whose present-day distribution is predominantly in southwestern China, northern Thailand and Myanmar
Chicken|chicken|These domesticated chickens spread across Southeast and South Asia where they interbred with local wild species of junglefowl, forming genetically and geographically distinct groups
Chicken|chicken|Analysis of the most popular commercial breed shows that the White Leghorn breed possesses a mosaic of divergent ancestries inherited from subspecies of red junglefowl.Middle Eastern chicken remains go back to a little earlier than 2000 BC in Syria; chickens went southward only in the 1st millennium BC
Chicken|chicken|They reached Egypt for purposes of cockfighting about 1400 BC, and became widely bred only in Ptolemaic Egypt (about 300 BC)
Chicken|chicken|Phoenicians spread chickens along the Mediterranean coasts as far as Iberia
Chicken|chicken|During the Hellenistic period (4th-2nd centuries BC), in the Southern Levant, chickens began to be widely domesticated for food
Chicken|chicken|This change occurred at least 100 years before domestication of chickens spread to Europe.
Chicken|chicken|Chickens reached Europe circa 800 BC
Chicken|chicken|Breeding increased under the Roman Empire, and was reduced in the Middle Ages
Chicken|chicken|Genetic sequencing of chicken bones from archaeological sites in Europe revealed that in the High Middle Ages chickens became less aggressive and began to lay eggs earlier in the breeding season.Three possible routes of introduction into Africa around the early first millennium AD could have been through the Egyptian Nile Valley, the East Africa Roman-Greek or Indian trade, or from Carthage and the Berbers, across the Sahara
Chicken|chicken|The earliest known remains are from Mali, Nubia, East Coast, and South Africa and date back to the middle of the first millennium AD.Domestic chicken in the Americas before Western contact is still an ongoing discussion, but blue-egged chickens, found only in the Americas and Asia, suggest an Asian origin for early American chickens.A lack of data from Thailand, Russia, the Indian subcontinent, Southeast Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa makes it difficult to lay out a clear map of the spread of chickens in these areas; better description and genetic analysis of local breeds threatened by extinction may also help with research into this area.
Chicken|chicken|An unusual variety of chicken that has its origins in South America is the Araucana, bred in southern Chile by the Mapuche people
Chicken|chicken|Araucanas lay blue-green eggs
Chicken|chicken|Additionally, some Araucanas are tailless, and some have tufts of feathers around their ears
Chicken|chicken|It has long been suggested that they pre-date the arrival of European chickens brought by the Spanish and are evidence of pre-Columbian trans-Pacific contacts between Asian or Pacific Oceanic peoples, particularly the Polynesians, and South America
Chicken|chicken|In 2007, an international team of researchers reported the results of their analysis of chicken bones found on the Arauco Peninsula in south-central Chile
Chicken|chicken|Radiocarbon dating suggested that the chickens were pre-Columbian, and DNA analysis showed that they were related to prehistoric populations of chickens in Polynesia
Chicken|chicken|These results appeared to confirm that the chickens came from Polynesia and that there were transpacific contacts between Polynesia and South America before Columbus's arrival in the Americas.However, a later report looking at the same specimens concluded:
Chicken|chicken|A published, apparently pre-Columbian, Chilean specimen and six pre-European Polynesian specimens also cluster with the same European/Indian subcontinental/Southeast Asian sequences, providing no support for a Polynesian introduction of chickens to South America
Chicken|chicken|In contrast, sequences from two archaeological sites on Easter Island group with an uncommon haplogroup from Indonesia, Japan, and China and may represent a genetic signature of an early Polynesian dispersal
Chicken|chicken|Modeling of the potential marine carbon contribution to the Chilean archaeological specimen casts further doubt on claims for pre-Columbian chickens, and definitive proof will require further analyses of ancient DNA sequences and radiocarbon and stable isotope data from archaeological excavations within both Chile and Polynesia.
Chicken|chicken|More than 50 billion chickens are reared annually as a source of  meat and eggs
Chicken|chicken|In the United States alone, more than 8 billion chickens are slaughtered each year for meat, and more than 300 million chickens are reared for egg production.The vast majority of poultry are raised in factory farms
Chicken|chicken|According to the Worldwatch Institute, 74 percent of the world's poultry meat and 68 percent of eggs are produced this way
Chicken|chicken|An alternative to intensive poultry farming is free-range farming.
Chicken|chicken|Friction between these two main methods has led to long-term issues of ethical consumerism
Chicken|chicken|Opponents of intensive farming argue that it harms the environment, creates human health risks and is inhumane
Chicken|chicken|Advocates of intensive farming say that their highly efficient systems save land and food resources owing to increased productivity, and that the animals are looked after in state-of-the-art environmentally controlled facilities.
Chicken|chicken|Chickens farmed for meat are called broilers
Chicken|chicken|Chickens will naturally live for six or more years, but broiler breeds typically take less than six weeks to reach slaughter size
Chicken|chicken|A free range or organic broiler will usually be slaughtered at about 14 weeks of age.
Chicken|chicken|Chickens farmed primarily for eggs are called layer hens
Chicken|chicken|In total, the UK alone consumes more than 34 million eggs per day
Chicken|chicken|"Some hen breeds can produce over 300 eggs per year, with ""the highest authenticated rate of egg laying being 371 eggs in 364 days"""
Chicken|chicken|After 12 months of laying, the commercial hen's egg-laying ability starts to decline to the point where the flock is commercially unviable
Chicken|chicken|Hens, particularly from battery cage systems, are sometimes infirm or have lost a significant amount of their feathers, and their life expectancy has been reduced from around seven years to less than two years
Chicken|chicken|"In the UK and Europe, laying hens are then slaughtered and used in processed foods or sold as ""soup hens"""
Chicken|chicken|In some other countries, flocks are sometimes force moulted, rather than being slaughtered, to re-invigorate egg-laying
Chicken|chicken|This involves complete withdrawal of food (and sometimes water) for 7–14 days or sufficiently long to cause a body weight loss of 25 to 35%, or up to 28 days under experimental conditions
Chicken|chicken|This stimulates the hen to lose her feathers, but also re-invigorates egg-production
Chicken|chicken|Some flocks may be force-moulted several times
Chicken|chicken|In 2003, more than 75% of all flocks were moulted in the US.
Chicken|chicken|Keeping chickens as pets became increasingly popular in the 2000s among urban and suburban residents
Chicken|chicken|Many people obtain chickens for their egg production but often name them and treat them as any other pet like cats or dogs
Chicken|chicken|Chickens provide companionship and have individual personalities
Chicken|chicken|While many do not cuddle much, they will eat from one's hand, jump onto one's lap, respond to and follow their handlers, as well as show affection.Chickens are social, inquisitive, intelligent birds, and many find their behaviour entertaining
Chicken|chicken|Certain breeds, such as Silkies and many bantam varieties, are generally docile and are often recommended as good pets around children with disabilities
Chicken|chicken|Many people feed chickens in part with kitchen food scraps.
Chicken|chicken|A cockfight is a contest held in a ring called a cockpit between two cocks known as gamecocks
Chicken|chicken|"This term, denoting a cock kept for game, sport, pastime or entertainment, appears in 1646, after ""cock of the game"" used by George Wilson in the earliest known book on the secular sport, The Commendation of Cocks and Cock Fighting of 1607"
Chicken|chicken|Gamecocks are not typical farm chickens
Chicken|chicken|The cocks are specially bred and trained for increased stamina and strength
Chicken|chicken|The comb and wattle are removed from a young gamecock because, if left intact, they would be a disadvantage during a match
Chicken|chicken|This process is called dubbing
Chicken|chicken|Sometimes the cocks are given drugs to increase their stamina or thicken their blood, which increases their chances of winning
Chicken|chicken|Cockfighting is considered a traditional sporting event by some, and an example of animal cruelty by others and is therefore outlawed in most countries
Chicken|chicken|Usually wagers are made on the outcome of the match, with the survivor or last bird standing declared winner.
Chicken|chicken|"Chickens were originally used for cockfighting, a sport where 2 male chickens or ""cocks"" fight each other until one dies or becomes badly injured"
Chicken|chicken|Cocks possess congenital aggression toward all other cocks to contest with females
Chicken|chicken|Studies suggest that cockfights have existed even up to the Indus Valley Civilisation as a pastime
Chicken|chicken|Today it is commonly associated with religious worship, pastime, and gambling in Asian and some South American countries
Chicken|chicken|"While not all fights are to the death, most use metal spurs as a ""weapon"" attached above or below the chicken's own spur and with this typically results in death in one or both cocks"
Chicken|chicken|If chickens are in practice owners place gloves on the spurs to prevent injuries
Chicken|chicken|Cockfighting has been banned in most western countries and debated by animal rights activist for its brutality.
Chicken|chicken|Incubation can successfully occur artificially in machines that provide the correct, controlled environment for the developing chick
Chicken|chicken|The average incubation period for chickens is 21 days but may depend on the temperature and humidity in the incubator
Chicken|chicken|Temperature regulation is the most critical factor for a successful hatch
Chicken|chicken|Variations of more than 1 °C (1.8 °F) from the optimum temperature of 37.5 °C (99.5 °F) will reduce hatch rates
Chicken|chicken|Humidity is also important because the rate at which eggs lose water by evaporation depends on the ambient relative humidity
Chicken|chicken|Evaporation can be assessed by candling, to view the size of the air sac, or by measuring weight loss
Chicken|chicken|Relative humidity should be increased to around 70% in the last three days of incubation to keep the membrane around the hatching chick from drying out after the chick cracks the shell
Chicken|chicken|Lower humidity is usual in the first 18 days to ensure adequate evaporation
Chicken|chicken|The position of the eggs in the incubator can also influence hatch rates
Chicken|chicken|For best results, eggs should be placed with the pointed ends down and turned regularly (at least three times per day) until one to three days before hatching
Chicken|chicken|If the eggs aren't turned, the embryo inside may stick to the shell and may hatch with physical defects
Chicken|chicken|Adequate ventilation is necessary to provide the embryo with oxygen
Chicken|chicken|Older eggs require increased ventilation.
Chicken|chicken|Many commercial incubators are industrial-sized with shelves holding tens of thousands of eggs at a time, with rotation of the eggs a fully automated process
Chicken|chicken|Home incubators are boxes holding from 6 to 75 eggs; they are usually electrically powered, but in the past some were heated with an oil or paraffin lamp.
Chicken|chicken|Chickens are susceptible to several parasites, including lice, mites, ticks, fleas, and intestinal worms, as well as other diseases
Chicken|chicken|Despite the name, they are not affected by chickenpox, which is generally restricted to humans.Chickens can carry and transmit salmonella in their dander and feces
Chicken|chicken|In the United States, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention advise against bringing them indoors or letting small children handle them.Some of the diseases that can affect chickens are shown below:
Chicken|chicken|An early domestication of chickens in Southeast Asia is probable, since the word for domestic chicken (*manuk) is part of the reconstructed Proto-Austronesian language (see Austronesian languages)
Chicken|chicken|Chickens, together with dogs and pigs, were the domestic animals of the Lapita culture, the first Neolithic culture of Oceania.The first pictures of chickens in Europe are found on Corinthian pottery of the 7th century BC.Chickens were spread by Polynesian seafarers and reached Easter Island in the 12th century AD, where they were the only domestic animal, with the possible exception of the Polynesian rat (Rattus exulans)
Chicken|chicken|"They were housed in extremely solid chicken coops built from stone, which was first reported as such to Linton Palmer in 1868, who also ""expressed his doubts about this""."

Chicken|chicken|Chick hatching from egg
Pig|pig|The pig (Sus domesticus), often called swine, hog, or domestic pig when distinguishing from other members of the genus Sus, is an omnivorous, domesticated even-toed ungulate
Pig|pig|It is variously considered a subspecies of the Eurasian boar or a distinct species, but the American Society of Mammalogists considers it the latter
Pig|pig|The pig's head-plus-body length ranges from 0.9 to 1.8 m (3 to 6 ft), and adult pigs typically weigh between 50 and 350 kg (110 and 770 lb), with well-fed individuals even exceeding this range
Pig|pig|The size and weight of hogs largely depends on their breed
Pig|pig|Compared to other artiodactyls, a pig's head is relatively long and pointed
Pig|pig|Most even-toed ungulates are herbivorous, but pigs are omnivores, like their wild relative
Pig|pig|Pigs grunt and make snorting sounds.
Pig|pig|When used as livestock, pigs are farmed primarily for the production of meat, called pork
Pig|pig|A group of pigs is called a passel, a team, or a sounder
Pig|pig|The animal's bones, hide, and bristles are also used in products
Pig|pig|Pigs, especially miniature breeds, are kept as pets.
Pig|pig|The pig typically has a large head, with a long snout which is strengthened by a special prenasal bone and a disk of cartilage at the tip
Pig|pig|The snout is used to dig into the soil to find food and is a very acute sense organ
Pig|pig|The dental formula of adult pigs is 3.1.4.33.1.4.3, giving a total of 44 teeth
Pig|pig|The rear teeth are adapted for crushing
Pig|pig|In the male, the canine teeth can form tusks, which grow continuously and are sharpened by constantly being ground against each other.Four hoofed toes are on each foot, with the two larger central toes bearing most of the weight, but the outer two also being used in soft ground.Most pigs have rather a bristled sparse hair covering on their skin, although woolly-coated breeds such as the Mangalitsa exist.Pigs possess both apocrine and eccrine sweat glands, although the latter appear limited to the snout and dorsonasal areas
Pig|pig|"Pigs, however, like other ""hairless"" mammals (e.g"
Pig|pig|elephants, rhinos, and mole-rats), do not use thermal sweat glands in cooling
Pig|pig|Pigs are also less able than many other mammals to dissipate heat from wet mucous membranes in the mouth through panting
Pig|pig|Their thermoneutral zone is 16 to 22 °C (61 to 72 °F)
Pig|pig|At higher temperatures, pigs lose heat by wallowing in mud or water via evaporative cooling, although it has been suggested that wallowing may serve other functions, such as protection from sunburn, ecto-parasite control, and scent-marking.Pigs are one of four known mammalian species which possess mutations in the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor that protect against snake venom
Pig|pig|Mongooses, honey badgers, hedgehogs, and pigs all have modifications to the receptor pocket which prevents the snake venom α-neurotoxin from binding
Pig|pig|These represent four separate, independent mutations.Pigs have small lungs in relation to their body size, and are thus more susceptible than other domesticated animals to fatal bronchitis and pneumonia.
Pig|pig|The pig is most often considered to be a subspecies of the wild boar, which was given the name Sus scrofa by Carl Linnaeus in 1758; following from this, the formal name of the pig is Sus scrofa domesticus
Pig|pig|However, in 1777, Johann Christian Polycarp Erxleben classified the pig as a separate species from the wild boar
Pig|pig|He gave it the name Sus domesticus, which is still used by some taxonomists.
Pig|pig|Archaeological evidence suggests that pigs were domesticated from wild boar in the Near East in the Tigris Basin, Çayönü, Cafer Höyük, Nevalı Çori being managed in the wild in a way similar to the way they are managed by some modern New Guineans
Pig|pig|Remains of pigs have been dated to earlier than 11,400 years ago in Cyprus
Pig|pig|Those animals must have been introduced from the mainland, which suggests domestication in the adjacent mainland by then
Pig|pig|There was also a separate domestication in China which took place about 8,000 years ago.In the Near East, pig husbandry spread for the next few millennia
Pig|pig|It reduced gradually during the Bronze Age, as rural populations focused instead on commodity-producing livestock
Pig|pig|It was sustained urbanized regions, however.DNA evidence from subfossil remains of teeth and jawbones of Neolithic pigs shows that the first domestic pigs in Europe had been brought from the Near East
Pig|pig|This stimulated the domestication of local European wild boar, resulting in a third domestication event with the Near Eastern genes dying out in European pig stock
Pig|pig|Modern domesticated pigs have involved complex exchanges, with European domesticated lines being exported, in turn, to the ancient Near East
Pig|pig|Historical records indicate that Asian pigs were introduced into Europe during the 18th and early 19th centuries.In August 2015, a study looked at over 100 pig genome sequences to ascertain their process of domestication, which was assumed to have been initiated by humans, involved few individuals, and relied on reproductive isolation between wild and domestic forms
Pig|pig|The study found that the assumption of reproductive isolation with population bottlenecks was not supported
Pig|pig|The study indicated that pigs were domesticated separately in Western Asia and China, with Western Asian pigs introduced into Europe, where they crossed with wild boar
Pig|pig|A model that fit the data included a mixture with a now extinct ghost population of wild pigs during the Pleistocene
Pig|pig|The study also found that despite back-crossing with wild pigs, the genomes of domestic pigs have strong signatures of selection at DNA loci that affect behavior and morphology
Pig|pig|The study concluded that human selection for domestic traits likely counteracted the homogenizing effect of gene flow from wild boars and created domestication islands in the genome
Pig|pig|The same process may also apply to other domesticated animals
Pig|pig|In 2019, a study showed that the pig had arrived in Europe from the Near East 8,500 years ago
Pig|pig|Over the next 3,000 years they then admixed with the European wild boar until their genome showed less than 5% Near Eastern ancestry, yet retained their domesticated features.Among the animals that the Spanish introduced to the Chiloé Archipelago in the 16th century, pigs were the most successful to adapt
Pig|pig|The pigs benefited from abundant shellfish and algae exposed by the large tides of the archipelago
Pig|pig|Pigs were brought to southeastern North America from Europe by de Soto and other early Spanish explorers
Pig|pig|Escaped pigs became feral and caused a great deal of disruption to Native Americans.
Pig|pig|Feral pig populations in the southeastern United States have since migrated north and are a growing concern in the Midwest
Pig|pig|Considered an invasive species, many state agencies have programs to trap or hunt feral pigs as means of removal
Pig|pig|Domestic pigs have become feral in many other parts of the world (e.g
Pig|pig|New Zealand and northern Queensland) and have caused substantial environmental damage
Pig|pig|Feral hybrids of the European wild boar with the domestic pig are also very disruptive to both environment and agriculture (among the 100 most damaging animal species), especially in southeastern South America from Uruguay to Brazil's Mato Grosso do Sul and São Paulo.With around 1 billion individuals alive at any time, the domesticated pig is one of the most numerous large mammals on the planet.
Pig|pig|Female pigs reach sexual maturity at 3–12 months of age and come into estrus every 18–24 days if they are not successfully bred
Pig|pig|The variation in ovulation rate can be attributed to intrinsic factors such as age and genotype, as well as extrinsic factors like nutrition, environment, and the supplementation of exogenous hormones
Pig|pig|The gestation period averages 112–120 days.
Pig|pig|Estrus lasts two to three days, and the female's displayed receptiveness to mate is known as standing heat
Pig|pig|Standing heat is a reflexive response that is stimulated when the female is in contact with the saliva of a sexually mature boar
Pig|pig|Androstenol is one of the pheromones produced in the submaxillary salivary glands of boars that will trigger the female's response
Pig|pig|The female cervix contains a series of five interdigitating pads, or folds, that will hold the boar's corkscrew-shaped penis during copulation
Pig|pig|Females have bicornuate uteruses and two conceptuses must be present in both uterine horns for pregnancy to be established
Pig|pig|Maternal recognition of pregnancy in pigs occurs on days 11 to 12 of pregnancy and is marked by progesterone production from a functioning corpus luteum (CL)
Pig|pig|To avoid luteolysis by PGF2α, rescuing of the CL must occur via embryonic signaling of estradiol 17β and PGE2
Pig|pig|This signaling acts on both the endometrium and luteal tissue to prevent the regression of the CL by activation of genes that are responsible for CL maintenance
Pig|pig|During mid to late pregnancy, the CL relies primarily on luteinizing hormone (LH) for maintenance until parturition
Pig|pig|Animal nutrition is important prior to reproduction and during gestation to ensure optimum reproductive performance is achieved.
Pig|pig|In many ways, their behaviour appears to be intermediate between that of other artiodactyls and of carnivores
Pig|pig|Pigs seek out the company of other pigs and often huddle to maintain physical contact, although they do not naturally form large herds
Pig|pig|They typically live in groups of about 8–10 adult sows, some young individuals, and some single males.Because of their relative lack of sweat glands, pigs often control their body temperature using behavioural thermoregulation
Pig|pig|Wallowing, which often consists of coating the body with mud, is a behaviour frequently exhibited by pigs
Pig|pig|They do not submerge completely under the mud, but vary the depth and duration of wallowing depending on environmental conditions
Pig|pig|Typically, adult pigs start wallowing once the ambient temperature is around 17–21 °C (63–70 °F)
Pig|pig|They cover themselves from head to toe in mud
Pig|pig|Pigs may use mud as a sunscreen, or as a method of keeping parasites away
Pig|pig|"Most bristled pigs will ""blow their coat"", meaning that they shed most of the longer, coarser stiff hair once a year, usually in spring or early summer, to prepare for the warmer months ahead.If conditions permit, pigs feed continuously for many hours and then sleep for many hours, in contrast to ruminants which tend to feed for a short time and then sleep for a short time"
Pig|pig|Pigs are omnivorous, and are highly versatile in their feeding behaviour
Pig|pig|As they are foraging animals, they primarily eat leaves, stems, roots, fruits, and flowers
Pig|pig|Pigs play an important role in regions where pig toilets are employed
Pig|pig|"Pigs are highly intelligent animals, on par with dogs, and according to David DiSalvo's writing in Forbes, they are ""widely considered the smartest domesticated animal in the world"
Pig|pig|"Pigs can move a cursor on a video screen with their snouts and understand what is happening onscreen, and even learn to distinguish between the scribbles they knew from those they saw for the first time."""
Pig|pig|Rooting is an instinctual behavior in pigs that is characterized by a pig nudging its snout into something
Pig|pig|Similar to a cat's kneading, rooting is found comforting
Pig|pig|It first happens when piglets are born to obtain their mother's milk, and can become a habitual, obsessive behavior which is most prominent in animals weaned too early
Pig|pig|Often, pigs will root and dig into the ground to forage for food
Pig|pig|By means of rooting, pigs have been used to till farmland.
Pig|pig|Rooting is known to also be used as a means of communication
Pig|pig|Nose rings that pierce the septum of the nose discourage rooting because they make the behavior painful
Pig|pig|The breed known as the kunekune hardly ever roots, as it can sustain itself by feeding on nothing other than grass
Pig|pig|Not having to root around in the soil to find underground food (e.g
Pig|pig|tubers), it thus has evolved to, for the most part, not possess the instinct for rooting.
Pig|pig|A behavioural characteristic of pigs which they share with carnivores is nest-building
Pig|pig|Sows root in the ground to create depressions and then build nests in which to give birth
Pig|pig|First, the sow digs a depression about the size of her body
Pig|pig|She then collects twigs and leaves, and carries these in her mouth to the depression, building them into a mound
Pig|pig|She distributes the softer, finer material to the centre of the mound using her feet
Pig|pig|When the mound reaches the desired height, she places large branches, up to 2 metres in length, on the surface
Pig|pig|She enters into the mound and roots around to create a depression within the gathered material
Pig|pig|She then gives birth in a lying position, which, again, is different from other artiodactyls, which usually give birth in a standing position.Nest-building behaviour is an important part in the process of pre and post-partum maternal behaviour
Pig|pig|Nest-building will occur during the last 24 hours before the onset of farrowing and becomes most intense during 12 to 6 hours before farrowing
Pig|pig|Nest-building is divided into two phases
Pig|pig|one of which is the initial phase of rooting in the ground while the second phase is the collecting, carrying and arranging of the nest material
Pig|pig|The sow will separate from the group and seek a suitable nest site with some shelter from rain and wind that has well-drained soil
Pig|pig|This nest-building behaviour is performed to provide the offspring with shelter, comfort, and thermoregulation
Pig|pig|The nest will provide protection against weather and predators while keeping the piglets close to the sow and away from the rest of the herd
Pig|pig|This ensures they do not get trampled on and that other piglets are not stealing milk from the sow
Pig|pig|Nest-building can be influenced by internal and external stimuli
Pig|pig|Internal hormonal changes and the completion of one nesting phase are indicators of this maternal behaviour
Pig|pig|The onset is triggered by the rise in prolactin levels, which is caused by a decrease in progesterone and an increase in prostaglandin, while the gathering of the nest material seems to be regulated more by external stimuli such as temperature
Pig|pig|The longer time spent on nest-building will increase pre-partum oxytocin.
Pig|pig|Pigs display complex nursing and suckling behaviour
Pig|pig|Nursing occurs every 50–60 minutes, and the sow requires stimulation from piglets before milk let-down
Pig|pig|Sensory inputs (vocalisation, odours from mammary and birth fluids and hair patterns of the sow) are particularly important immediately post-birth to facilitate teat location by the piglets
Pig|pig|Initially, the piglets compete for position at the udder; then the piglets massage around their respective teats with their snouts, during which time the sow grunts at slow, regular intervals
Pig|pig|Each series of grunts varies in frequency, tone and magnitude, indicating the stages of nursing to the piglets.The phase of competition for teats and of nosing the udder lasts for about one minute and ends when milk flow begins
Pig|pig|In the third phase, the piglets hold the teats in their mouths and suck with slow mouth movements (one per second), and the rate of the sow's grunting increases for approximately 20 seconds
Pig|pig|The grunt peak in the third phase of suckling does not coincide with milk ejection, but rather the release of oxytocin from the pituitary into the bloodstream
Pig|pig|Phase four coincides with the period of main milk flow (10–20 seconds) when the piglets suddenly withdraw slightly from the udder and start sucking with rapid mouth movements of about three per second
Pig|pig|The sow grunts rapidly, lower in tone and often in quick runs of three or four, during this phase
Pig|pig|Finally, the flow stops and so does the grunting of the sow
Pig|pig|The piglets may then dart from teat to teat and recommence suckling with slow movements, or nosing the udder
Pig|pig|Piglets massage and suckle the sow's teats after milk flow ceases as a way of letting the sow know their nutritional status
Pig|pig|This helps her to regulate the amount of milk released from that teat in future sucklings
Pig|pig|The more intense the post-feed massaging of a teat, the greater the future milk release from that teat will be.
Pig|pig|In pigs, dominance hierarchies can be formed at a very early age
Pig|pig|Piglets are highly precocious and within minutes of being born, or sometimes seconds, will attempt to suckle
Pig|pig|The piglets are born with sharp teeth and fight to develop a teat order as the anterior teats produce a greater quantity of milk
Pig|pig|Once established, this teat order remains stable with each piglet tending to feed on a particular teat or group of teats
Pig|pig|Stimulation of the anterior teats appears to be important in causing milk letdown, so it might be advantageous to the entire litter to have these teats occupied by healthy piglets.
Pig|pig|Pigs have panoramic vision of approximately 310° and binocular vision of 35° to 50°
Pig|pig|It is thought they have no eye accommodation
Pig|pig|Other animals that have no accommodation, e.g
Pig|pig|sheep, lift their heads to see distant objects
Pig|pig|The extent to which pigs have colour vision is still a source of some debate; however, the presence of cone cells in the retina with two distinct wavelength sensitivities (blue and green) suggests that at least some colour vision is present.Pigs have a well-developed sense of smell, and use is made of this in Europe where they are trained to locate underground truffles
Pig|pig|Olfactory rather than visual stimuli are used in the identification of other pigs
Pig|pig|Hearing is also well developed, and localisation of sounds is made by moving the head
Pig|pig|Pigs use auditory stimuli extensively as a means of communication in all social activities
Pig|pig|Alarm or aversive stimuli are transmitted to other pigs not only by auditory cues but also by pheromones
Pig|pig|Similarly, recognition between the sow and her piglets is by olfactory and vocal cues.
Pig|pig|Many breeds of pig exist, with different colors, shapes, and sizes
Pig|pig|According to The Livestock Conservancy, as of 2016, three breeds of pig are critically rare (having a global population of fewer than 2000)
Pig|pig|They are the Choctaw hog, the Mulefoot, and the Ossabaw Island hog
Pig|pig|The smallest known pig breed in the world is the Göttingen minipig, typically weighing about 26 kilograms (57 lb) as a healthy, full-grown adult.
Pig|pig|When in use as livestock, the pig is mostly farmed for its meat, pork
Pig|pig|Other food products made from pigs include pork sausage (which includes casings that are made from the intestines), bacon, gammon, ham and pork rinds
Pig|pig|The head of a pig can be used to make a preserved jelly called head cheese, which is sometimes known as brawn
Pig|pig|Liver, chitterlings, blood (for black pudding), and other offal from pigs are also widely used for food
Pig|pig|In some religions, such as Judaism and Islam, pork is a taboo food
Pig|pig|Approximately 1.5 billion pigs are slaughtered each year for meat.The use of pig milk for human consumption does take place, but as there are certain difficulties in obtaining it, there is little commercial production.
Pig|pig|In some developing and developed nations, the pig is usually raised outdoors in yards or fields
Pig|pig|In some areas, pigs are allowed to forage in woods where they may be taken care of by swineherds
Pig|pig|In industrialized nations such as the United States, pig farming has switched from the traditional pig farm to large-scale intensive pig farms
Pig|pig|This has resulted in lower production costs but can cause significant cruelty problems
Pig|pig|As consumers have become concerned with the humane treatment of livestock, demand for pasture-raised pork in these nations has increased.
Pig|pig|In many respects, pot-bellied pigs are desirable and entertaining pets
Pig|pig|They are considered intelligent, gregarious, and trainable
Pig|pig|They lack the genetic hereditary weaknesses which commonly afflict certain pedigree cat and dog breeds, are generally quite sturdy, and have a reasonably affordable diet despite requiring large quantities of food
Pig|pig|However, they can be strong-willed, defiant, and independent pets which will sometimes defy training
Pig|pig|They require access to an outdoor space at all times, and depending on the individual pig, may become housebroken easily or never settle indoors
Pig|pig|While hardy, an injured or sick pig will require costly surgery or larger than average quantities of medicine than most pets
Pig|pig|Rescuing an abandoned fully-grown pig is usually a more reliable means of getting exactly what you expect than taking a piglet home.Pigs are highly intelligent, social creatures
Pig|pig|They are considered hypoallergenic, and are known to do quite well with people who have the usual animal allergies
Pig|pig|Since these animals are known to have a life expectancy of 15 to 20 years, they require a long-term commitment.
Pig|pig|Given pigs are bred primarily as livestock and have not been bred as companion animals for very long, selective breeding for a placid or biddable temperament is not well established
Pig|pig|Pigs have radically different psychology to dogs and exhibit fight-or-flight instincts, independent nature, and natural assertiveness which can manifest as aggression towards children and a tendency to panic and lash out with little warning
Pig|pig|Cats generally are safe around pigs as neither species has an incentive to express aggression or fear towards the other, although dogs will view pigs as prey animals and in turn, pigs will challenge dogs for food, leading to very violent fights.
Pig|pig|Male and female swine that have not been de-sexed may express unwanted aggressive behavior, and are prone to developing serious health issues
Pig|pig|Regular trimming of the hooves is necessary; hooves left untreated cause major pain in the pig, can create malformations in bone structure and may cause him or her to be more susceptible to fungal growth between crevices of the hoof, or between the cracks in a split hoof
Pig|pig|Male pigs, especially when left unaltered, can grow large, sharp tusks which may continue growing for years
Pig|pig|Domestic owners may wish to keep their pigs' tusks trimmed back, or have them removed entirely.
Pig|pig|As prey animals, pigs' natural instinctive behavior causes them to have a strong fear of being picked up, resulting in the animal expressing stress through struggling and squealing, but they will usually calm down once placed back onto the ground
Pig|pig|This instinctual fear may be lessened if the pig has been frequently held since infancy
Pig|pig|When holding pigs, supporting them under the legs makes being held not as stressful for the animal
Pig|pig|Pigs need enrichment activities to keep their intelligent minds occupied; if pigs get bored, they often become destructive
Pig|pig|As rooting is found to be comforting, pigs kept in the house may root household objects, furniture or surfaces
Pig|pig|While some owners are known to pierce their pigs' noses to discourage rooting behaviour, the efficacy and humaneness of this practice is questionable
Pig|pig|Pet pigs should be let outside daily to allow them to fulfill their natural desire of rooting around.
Pig|pig|Pigs, both as live animals and a source of post-mortem tissues are one of the most valuable animal models used in biomedical research today, because of their biological, physiological, and anatomical similarities to human beings
Pig|pig|For instance, human skin is very similar to the pigskin, therefore pigskin has been used in many preclinical studies
Pig|pig|Porcine are used in finding treatments, cures for diseases, xenotransplantation, and for general education
Pig|pig|They are also used in the development of medical instruments and devices, surgical techniques and instrumentation, and FDA-approved research
Pig|pig|These animals contribute to the reduction methods for animal research, as they supply more information from fewer animals used, for a lower cost.
Pig|pig|Pigs are currently thought to be the best non-human candidates for organ donation to humans, and to date they are the only animal that has successfully donated an organ to a human body
Pig|pig|The first successful donation of a non-human organ to a human body was conducted on 15 September 2021, when a kidney from a pig was transplanted to a brain-dead human and immediately started functioning similarly to a human kidney
Pig|pig|The procedure, led by Dr
Pig|pig|Robert Montgomery, used a donor pig that was genetically engineered to not have a specific carbohydrate that the human body considers a threat–Galactose-alpha-1,3-galactose
Pig|pig|This followed an earlier major breakthrough when the carbohydrate was removed from genetically engineered mice.Besides similarity between pig and human organs, pigs are among the best animals suited for human donation due the lower risk of cross-species disease transmission
Pig|pig|This is caused by pigs' increased phylogenetic distance from humans
Pig|pig|Furthermore, they are readily available, and new infectious agents are less likely since they have been in close contact with humans through domestication for many generations.Some obstacles to successful organ donation from a pig to a human arise from the response of the recipient's immune system—generally more extreme than in allotransplantations, ultimately results in rejection of the xenograft, and in some cases results in the death of the recipient—including hyperacute rejection, acute vascular rejection, cellular rejection, and chronic rejection.
Pig|pig|Examples of viruses carried by pigs include porcine herpesvirus, rotavirus, parvovirus, and circovirus
Pig|pig|Of particular concern are PERVs (porcine endogenous retroviruses), vertically transmitted viruses that embed in swine genomes
Pig|pig|The risks with xenosis are twofold, as not only could the individual become infected, but a novel infection could initiate an epidemic in the human population
Pig|pig|Because of this risk, the FDA has suggested any recipients of xenotransplants shall be closely monitored for the remainder of their life, and quarantined if they show signs of xenosis.Pig cells have been engineered to inactivate all 62 PERVs in the genome using CRISPR Cas9 genome editing technology, and eliminated infection from the pig to human cells in culture.

Mycoplasma hyorhinis|pig|Mycoplasma hyorhinis is a species of bacteria in the Mycoplasmataceae family
Mycoplasma hyorhinis|pig|It is often found as a commensal in the respiratory tract of pigs, and rarely in the skin of humans
Mycoplasma hyorhinis|pig|M
Mycoplasma hyorhinis|pig|hyorhinis is thought to facilitate and exacerbate the development of diseases such as porcine enzootic pneumonia and porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome (PRRS)
Mycoplasma hyorhinis|pig|Rarely, it may cause mycoplasma arthritis, mycoplasmal polyserositis or mycoplasma septicaemia in piglets without the involvement of other bacteria
Mycoplasma hyorhinis|pig|This presents as polyarthritis or polyserositis.
Mycoplasma hyorhinis|pig|M
Mycoplasma hyorhinis|pig|hyorhinis can prevent cell death caused by nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase inhibitors.
Mycoplasma hyorhinis|pig|Lameness, polyserositis and joint swelling are the most common symptoms
Mycoplasma hyorhinis|pig|A foul-smelling discharge from the ears can occur secondary to otitis
Mycoplasma hyorhinis|pig|Less specific signs include poor coat quality, pyrexia, cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, neurological and respiratory signs.

Peccary|pig|A peccary (also javelina or skunk pig) is a medium-sized pig-like hoofed mammal of the family Tayassuidae (New World pigs)
Peccary|pig|They are found throughout Central and South America, Trinidad in the Caribbean, and in the southwestern area of North America
Peccary|pig|They usually measure between 90 and 130 cm (2 ft 11 in and 4 ft 3 in) in length, and a full-grown adult usually weighs about 20 to 40 kg (44 to 88 lb).
Peccary|pig|Peccaries are social creatures that live in herds
Peccary|pig|They eat roots, grubs, and a variety of foods
Peccary|pig|They can identify each other by their strong odors
Peccary|pig|"A group of peccaries that travel and live together is called a ""squadron"""
Peccary|pig|A squadron of peccaries averages between six and nine members.The last common ancestors of peccaries and other even-toed ungulates were vaguely piglike animals that lived over 50 million years ago
Peccary|pig|Peccaries evolved in Europe about 30 million years ago and spread across much of the world
Peccary|pig|In the Old World, peccaries went extinct, but they survived in North America
Peccary|pig|About three million years ago, peccaries spread into South America.
Peccary|pig|Mayans kept herds of peccaries, using them in rituals and for food
Peccary|pig|They are kept as pets in many countries, in addition to being raised on farms as a source of food.
Peccary|pig|"The word ""peccary"" is derived from the Carib word pakira or paquira.In Portuguese, a peccary is called pecari, porco-do-mato, queixada, or tajaçu, among other names"
Peccary|pig|In Spanish, it is called javelina, jabalí (a word also used to describe wild boar), sajino, or pecarí
Peccary|pig|"The word ""javelina"" derives from the Spanish word for ""wild boar"""
Peccary|pig|In French Guiana and Suriname, the animal is called pakira.
Peccary|pig|A peccary is a medium-sized animal, with a strong resemblance to a pig
Peccary|pig|Like a pig, it has a snout ending in a cartilaginous disc, and eyes that are small relative to its head
Peccary|pig|Also like a pig, it uses only the middle two digits for walking, although, unlike pigs, the other toes may be altogether absent
Peccary|pig|Its stomach is not ruminating, although it has three chambers, and is more complex than those of pigs.Peccaries are omnivores and will eat insects, grubs, and occasionally small animals, although their preferred foods consist of roots, grasses, seeds, fruit, and cacti—particularly prickly pear
Peccary|pig|Pigs and peccaries can be differentiated by the shape of the canine tooth, or tusk
Peccary|pig|In European pigs, the tusk is long and curves around on itself, whereas in peccaries, the tusk is short and straight
Peccary|pig|The jaws and tusks of peccaries are adapted for crushing hard seeds and slicing into plant roots, and they also use their tusks for defending against predators
Peccary|pig|The dental formula for peccaries is
Peccary|pig|2.1.3.33.1.3.3
Peccary|pig|By rubbing the tusks together, they can make a chattering noise that warns potential predators to stay away
Peccary|pig|In recent years in northwestern Bolivia near Madidi National Park, large groups of peccaries have been reported to have seriously injured or killed people.Peccaries are social animals, often forming herds
Peccary|pig|Over 100 individuals have been recorded for a single herd of white-lipped peccaries, but collared and Chacoan peccaries usually form smaller groups
Peccary|pig|Such social behavior seems to have been the situation in extinct peccaries, as well
Peccary|pig|The recently discovered giant peccary (Pecari maximus) of Brazil appears to be less social, primarily living in pairs
Peccary|pig|Peccaries rely on their social structure to defend territory, protect against predators, regulate temperature, and interact socially.Peccaries have scent glands below each eye and another on their backs, though these are believed to be rudimentary in P
Peccary|pig|maximus
Peccary|pig|They use the scent to mark herd territories, which range from 30 to 280 hectares (75 to 700 acres)
Peccary|pig|They also mark other herd members with these scent glands by rubbing one against another
Peccary|pig|The pungent odor allows peccaries to recognize other members of their herd, despite their myopic vision
Peccary|pig|"The odor is strong enough to be detected by humans, which earns the peccary the nickname of ""skunk pig""."

Peccary|pig|"tajacu)The collared peccary (Dicotyles tajacu) or ""musk hog"", referring to the animal's scent glands, occurs from the Southwestern United States into South America and the island of Trinidad"
Peccary|pig|"The coat consists of wiry peppered black, gray, and brown hair with a lighter colored ""collar"" circling the shoulders"
Peccary|pig|They bear young year-round, but most often between November and March, with the average litter size consisting of two to three offspring
Peccary|pig|They are found in many habitats, from arid scrublands to humid tropical rain forests
Peccary|pig|The collared peccary is well-adapted to habitat disturbed by humans, merely requiring sufficient cover
Peccary|pig|They can be found in cities and agricultural land throughout their range
Peccary|pig|Notable populations exist in the suburbs of Phoenix and Tucson, Arizona, where they feed on ornamental plants and other cultivated vegetation
Peccary|pig|There are also urban populations as far north as Sedona, Arizona where they have been known to fill a niche similar to raccoons and other urban scavengers
Peccary|pig|"In Arizona they are often called by their Spanish name ""javelinas"""
Peccary|pig|Collared peccaries are generally found in bands of 8 to 15 animals of various ages
Peccary|pig|They defend themselves if they feel threatened, but otherwise tend to ignore humans.
Peccary|pig|A second species, the white-lipped peccary (Tayassu pecari), is mainly found in rainforests of Central and South America, but also known from a wide range of other habitats such as dry forests, grasslands, mangrove, cerrado, and dry xerophytic areas
Peccary|pig|The two main threats to their survival are deforestation and hunting.
Peccary|pig|The third species, the Chacoan peccary (Catagonus wagneri), is the closest living relative to the extinct Platygonus pearcei
Peccary|pig|It is found in the dry shrub habitat or Chaco of Paraguay, Bolivia, and Argentina
Peccary|pig|The Chacoan peccary has the distinction of having been first described based on fossils and was originally thought to be an extinct species
Peccary|pig|In 1975, the animal was discovered in the Chaco region of Paraguay
Peccary|pig|The species was well known to the native people.
Peccary|pig|A fourth as yet unconfirmed species, the giant peccary (Dicotyles maximus), was described from the Brazilian Amazon and north Bolivia by Dutch biologist Marc van Roosmalen
Peccary|pig|"Though relatively recently discovered, it has been known to the local Tupi people as caitetu munde, which means ""great peccary which lives in pairs"""
Peccary|pig|Thought to be the largest extant peccary, it can grow to 1.2 m (3 ft 11 in) in length
Peccary|pig|Its pelage is completely dark gray, with no collars whatsoever
Peccary|pig|Unlike other peccaries, it lives in pairs, or with one or two offspring
Peccary|pig|However, the scientific evidence for considering it as a species separate from the collared peccary has later been questioned, leading the IUCN to treat it as a synonym.
Peccary|pig|Peccaries first appeared in the fossil records of the Late Eocene or Early Oligocene periods in Europe
Peccary|pig|Fossils have later been found in all continents except Australia and Antarctica
Peccary|pig|Peccaries became extinct in the Old World sometime after the Miocene period, possibly because of competition from evolving pigs
Peccary|pig|Extinct genera include the Miocene-aged Macrogenis and Floridachoerus
Peccary|pig|Simojovelhyus, known from a lower partial mandible with three molars from late Oligocene strata near the town of Simojovel in Chiapas, Mexico, was originally described as a helohyid.Although common in South America today, peccaries did not reach there until about three million years ago during the Great American Interchange, when the Isthmus of Panama formed, connecting North America and South America
Peccary|pig|At that time, many North American animals—including peccaries, llamas and tapirs—entered South America, while some South American species, such as the ground sloths and opossums, migrated north
Peccary|pig|Several species of peccary across the genera Platygonus and Mylohyus remained in North America until their extinction following the colonization of the continent by humans via Beringia at the end of the Pleistocene
Peccary|pig|Today, 2 of the 3 species are relegated to the Neotropical realm, but the collared peccary ranges into northern Mexico and the southwestern United States.
Peccary|pig|Peccaries bear a superficial resemblance to pigs and are in the same suborder Suina as swine, and have been present in South America since prehistoric times
Peccary|pig|"The earliest scientific description of peccaries in the New World is in Brazil in 1547 and referred to them as ""wild pigs"".It has been documented that peccaries were tamed, penned, and raised for food and ritual purposes in the Yucatan, Panama, the southern Caribbean, and Colombia at the time of the Conquest"
Peccary|pig|Archaeological remains of peccaries have been found in Mesoamerica from the Preclassic (or Formative) period up until immediately before Spanish contact
Peccary|pig|Specifically, peccary remains have been found at Early Formative Olmec civilization sites.The peccary is not readily suitable for modern captive breeding, lacking suitable characteristics for intensive or semi-intensive systems
Peccary|pig|Peccaries require a higher age before they are able to give birth (parturition) and have a tendency towards infanticide.
Peccary|pig|Recently established Brazilian boar populations are not to be confused with long-established populations of feral domestic pigs, which have existed mainly in the Pantanal for more than 100 years, along with native peccaries
Peccary|pig|The demographic dynamics of the interaction between feral pig populations and those of the two native species of peccaries (collared peccary and white-lipped peccary) is obscure and is still being studied
Peccary|pig|The existence of feral pigs could somewhat ease jaguar predation on peccary populations, as jaguars show a preference for hunting pigs when they are available.
Pigs in culture|pig|Pigs, widespread in societies around the world since neolithic times, have been used for many purposes in art, literature, and other expressions of human culture
Pigs in culture|pig|In classical times, the Romans considered pork the finest of meats, enjoying sausages, and depicting them in their art
Pigs in culture|pig|Across Europe, pigs have been celebrated in carnivals since the Middle Ages, becoming specially important in Medieval Germany in cities such as Nuremberg, and in Early Modern Italy in cities such as Bologna.
Pigs in culture|pig|In literature, both for children and adults, pig characters appear in allegories, comic stories, and serious novels
Pigs in culture|pig|In art, pigs have been represented in a wide range of media and styles from the earliest times in many cultures
Pigs in culture|pig|Pig names are used in idioms and animal epithets, often derogatory, since pigs have long been linked with dirtiness and greed, while places such as Swindon are named for their association with swine
Pigs in culture|pig|The eating of pork is forbidden in Islam and Judaism, but pigs are sacred in some other religions.
Pigs in culture|pig|"The scholar Michael MacKinnon writes that ""Pork was generally considered the choicest of all the domestic meats consumed during Roman times, and it was ingested in a multitude of forms, from sausages to steaks, by rich and poor alike"
Pigs in culture|pig|No other animal had so many Latin names (e.g
Pigs in culture|pig|"sus, porcus, porco, aper) or was the ingredient in so many ancient recipes as outlined in the culinary manual of Apicius."" Pigs have been found at almost every archaeological site in Roman Italy; they are described by Roman agricultural writers such as Cato and Varro, and in Pliny the Elder's Natural History"

Pigs in culture|pig|Benton Jay Komins, a scholar of culture, notes that the pig has been celebrated throughout Europe since ancient times in its carnivals, the name coming from the Italian carne levare, the lifting of meat
Pigs in culture|pig|Komins quotes the scholars Peter Stallybrass and Allon White on the pig's ambiguous role:
Pigs in culture|pig|"""In the fair and the carnival, we would expect to find a quite different orientation toward the pig"
Pigs in culture|pig|in 'carne-levare' the pig was celebrated; the pleasures of food were represented in the sausage and the rites of inversion were emblematized in the pig's bladder of the fool

Pigs in culture|pig|In England, pork pies were being made in Melton Mowbray, Leicestershire by the 1780s, according to the Melton Mowbray Pork Pie Association (founded in 1998)
Pigs in culture|pig|The pies were originally baked in a clay pot with a pastry cover, developing to their modern form of a pastry case
Pigs in culture|pig|Local tradition states that farm hands carried these while at work; aristocratic fox hunters of the Quorn, Cottesmore and Belvoir hunts supposedly saw this and acquired a taste for the pies
Pigs in culture|pig|A slightly later date of origin is given by the claim that pie manufacture in the town began around 1831 when a local baker and confectioner, Edward Adcock, started to make pies as a sideline

Truffle hog|pig|A truffle hog is any domestic pig used for locating and extracting the fruit bodies of the fungi known as truffles from temperate forests in Europe and North America
Truffle hog|pig|Pigs have a great sense of smell, and are able to identify truffles from as deep as three feet underground
Truffle hog|pig|It is thought that the natural sex hormones of the male pig are similar to the smell of the truffles, and, also, pigs have a natural affinity for rooting in the earth for food
Truffle hog|pig|However, they are trained to hunt truffles by walking on a leash through suitable groves with a keeper.
Truffle hog|pig|The use of pigs to hunt truffles is said to date back to the Roman Empire, but the first well-documented use comes from the Italian Renaissance writer and gastronomist, Bartolomeo Platina, in the 15th century
Truffle hog|pig|Later references to truffle pigs include John Ray in the 17th century.In 1875, a truffle hog could cost up to 200 francs
Truffle hog|pig|A skilled truffler could more than make up for this investment from the high price of truffles on the gourmet food market
Truffle hog|pig|"Today, dogs (known as ""truffle hounds"") are commonly used for gathering truffles in place of truffle hogs, as pigs have been known to eat too many truffles in the field"
Truffle hog|pig|Unlike pigs, dogs have no natural affinity for truffles, and must be specially scent to locate them
Truffle hog|pig|A trained Lagotto Romagnolo (an Italian breed recognized for its truffle-finding capability) can cost up to $10,000
Truffle hog|pig|Stealing such dogs is a common crime among rival hunters
Truffle hog|pig|However, traditionalists argue that the swine have more sensitive noses and their particular taste for truffles leads to a more devoted beast
Truffle hog|pig|It is frequent for the hog to be a family pet of the truffler.
Xenotransfusion|pig|Xenotransfusion (from Greek xenos- strange or foreign), a form of xenotransplantation, was initially defined as the transfer of blood from one species into the veins of another
Xenotransfusion|pig|In most cases, it is a transfer of blood between a non-human animal and a human
Xenotransfusion|pig|However, further experimentation has been done between various non-human animal species
Xenotransfusion|pig|This procedure can be performed without affecting the health of the donor, as only about 10% of their blood volume is used each time
Xenotransfusion|pig|Utilizing the unlimited blood supply from animal sources eliminates the risk of transmitting infectious diseases between humans.In 1658, Dom Robert des Gabets, a French monk, introduced the idea of xenotransfusion at a scientific society meeting
Xenotransfusion|pig|This society later afforded the French Academy of Sciences
Xenotransfusion|pig|Currently there are not any laws prohibiting the practice of xenotransfusion, but some ethical issues have been identified by the Ethics Committee of the International Xenotransplantation Association (IXA)
Xenotransfusion|pig|For example, the IXA sets standards and regulations for those planning to orchestrate clinical xenotransplantation trials
Xenotransfusion|pig|The IXA has identified three major ethical areas that require adequate attention
Xenotransfusion|pig|favorable risk and benefit assessment supported by pre-clinical data, lack of alternative treatment for participants, and minimizing the risk of infection by ensuring the highest biosafety regulations are followed for selected animal donors
Xenotransfusion|pig|These are just a few examples of the ethics behind xenotransplantation.
Xenotransfusion|pig|Jean-Baptiste Denis, a French physician, and Paul Emmerez, a surgeon, performed the first documented xenotransfusion on June 15, 1667
Xenotransfusion|pig|The transfusion occurred between a lamb and a 15-year-old boy
Xenotransfusion|pig|Carotid artery blood from the lamb was introduced to a vein in the patient’s inner elbow, and the procedure ultimately resulted in a successful recovery
Xenotransfusion|pig|Denis and Emmerez performed multiple xenotransfusions together
Xenotransfusion|pig|On June 24, 1667, the duo performed a transfusion on a young Swedish nobleman
Xenotransfusion|pig|When they arrived, the patient had already lost his ability to speak and was practically unconscious
Xenotransfusion|pig|Shortly after the transfusion began, the patient was able to speak again
Xenotransfusion|pig|His health was improving until his condition grew progressively worse
Xenotransfusion|pig|A second transfusion took place, but it was unsuccessful, and the patient died.
Xenotransfusion|pig|Richard Lower, an English physician, performed a similar procedure on November 23, 1667
Xenotransfusion|pig|He successfully transfused the blood of a lamb to a 22-year-old man
Xenotransfusion|pig|In both cases, the whole blood of the lamb was directly introduced into the vein of the patient
Xenotransfusion|pig|The direct introduction of blood was due to a lack of knowledge in preventative blood coagulation techniques at the time.
Xenotransfusion|pig|After several xenotransfusion procedures, some successful some not, the French Parliament prohibited the practice of these transfusions in 1670
Xenotransfusion|pig|The English Parliament, as well as the Pope, followed suit and prohibited the procedures shortly after.
Xenotransfusion|pig|Xenotransfusion uses non-human animals to aid in the shortage of blood for blood transfusion in humans
Xenotransfusion|pig|Although there needs to be more study on the topic some scientists are already considering the idea to use Sus scrofa domesticus (pigs) for blood transfusion
Xenotransfusion|pig|To come up with this answer they tested many animals to see which one was the best candidate for blood donation
Xenotransfusion|pig|As a result, pig red blood cells (pRBCs) showed more characteristics similar to that of a human
Xenotransfusion|pig|Starting with RBC diameters (pig 6 μm
Xenotransfusion|pig|human 7.2 μm) and RBC counts (pig 5.7 to 6.9 million/ll; human 4.2 to 6.2 million/ll) and, RBC average lifespan (86 vs
Xenotransfusion|pig|120 days)
Xenotransfusion|pig|Current evidence shows that pRBCs will function normally in humans due to a relation between porcine blood groups and human ABO group system
Xenotransfusion|pig|In addition, it is possible to produce pigs with type O blood and it is also possible to genetically modify the pig to make its blood more compatible with humans
Xenotransfusion|pig|Sus scrofa domesticus’s blood will be used to save lives and to increase blood quantity
Xenotransfusion|pig|The organism will be kept alive and no serious harm will be involved in XTF
Xenotransfusion|pig|It will be similar to how blood is removed from humans
Xenotransfusion|pig|Only 10% of the animal’s blood volume will be used each time, therefore, it is ethically acceptable to raise pigs for periodical blood collection as it does not damage the health of the animal
Xenotransfusion|pig|It will also be ethical to use pRBCs on humans since it will not cause a severe harm on human’s health
Xenotransfusion|pig|At the moment XTF is not a real necessity because a lot of people are willing to donate their blood and there is not a significant shortage on blood.
Xenotransfusion|pig|Transfusion of canine blood into domestic cats was performed historically and continues to be performed in some countries.Xenotransfusions have been performed on birds, though the procedure is only done to stabilize a bird in shock, due to rejection by the recipient bird's antibodies.Xenotransfusion of bovine whole blood into domestic goats has been preliminarily investigated as a potential option for anemic goats
Xenotransfusion|pig|When comparing caprine-recipient bovine-donor cross matching a study found 11/15 caprine-bovine combinations compatible on both major and minor cross matching.
