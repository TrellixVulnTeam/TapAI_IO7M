Broccoli (Brassica oleracea var|broccoli
italica) is an edible green plant in the cabbage family (family Brassicaceae, genus Brassica) whose large flowering head, stalk and small associated leaves are eaten as a vegetable|broccoli
Broccoli is classified in the Italica cultivar group of the species Brassica oleracea|broccoli
Broccoli has large flower heads, usually dark green, arranged in a tree-like structure branching out from a thick stalk which is usually light green|broccoli
The mass of flower heads is surrounded by leaves|broccoli
Broccoli resembles cauliflower, which is a different, but closely related cultivar group of the same Brassica species.|broccoli
It is eaten either raw or cooked|broccoli
Broccoli is a particularly rich source of vitamin C and vitamin K|broccoli
"Contents of its characteristic sulfur-containing glucosinolate compounds, isothiocyanates and sulforaphane, are diminished by boiling, but are better preserved by steaming, microwaving or stir-frying.Rapini, sometimes called ""broccoli rabe,"" is a distinct species from broccoli, forming similar but smaller heads and is actually a type of turnip (Brassica rapa)."|broccoli
Broccoli resulted from breeding of landrace Brassica crops in the northern Mediterranean starting in about the sixth century BCE|broccoli
Broccoli has its origins in primitive cultivars grown in the Roman Empire and was most likely improved via artificial selection in the southern Italian Peninsula or in Sicily|broccoli
Broccoli was spread to northern Europe by the 18th century and brought to North America in the 19th century by Italian immigrants|broccoli
After the Second World War, breeding of United States and Japanese F1 hybrids increased yields, quality, growth speed, and regional adaptation, which produced the cultivars that have been the most popular since then|broccoli
'Premium Crop', 'Packman', and 'Marathon'.|broccoli
Other cultivar groups of Brassica oleracea include cabbage (Capitata Group), cauliflower and Romanesco broccoli (Botrytis Group), kale (Acephala Group), collard (Viridis Group), kohlrabi (Gongylodes Group), Brussels sprouts (Gemmifera Group), and kai-lan (Alboglabra Group)|broccoli
As these groups are the same species, they readily hybridize|broccoli
"for example, Broccolini or ""Tenderstem broccoli"" is a cross between broccoli and Kai-lan"|broccoli
"Broccoli cultivars form the genetic basis of the ""tropical cauliflowers"" commonly grown in South and Southeastern Asia, although they produce a more cauliflower-like head in warmer conditions."|broccoli
There are three commonly grown types of broccoli|broccoli
"The most familiar is Calabrese broccoli, often referred to simply as ""broccoli"", named after Calabria in Italy"|broccoli
It has large (10 to 20 cm) green heads and thick stalks|broccoli
It is a cool-season annual crop|broccoli
Sprouting broccoli (white or purple) has a larger number of heads with many thin stalks|broccoli
Purple cauliflower or Violet Cauliflower is a type of broccoli grown in Europe and North America|broccoli
It has a head shaped like cauliflower, but consisting of many tiny flower buds|broccoli
It sometimes, but not always, has a purple cast to the tips of the flower buds|broccoli
Purple cauliflower may also be white, red, green, or other colors.Other popular cultivars include Belstar, Blue Wind, Coronado Crown, Destiny, DiCicco, Green Goliath, Green Magic, Purple Sprouting, Romanesco, Sun King and Waltham 29.Beneforté is a variety of broccoli containing 2–3 times more glucoraphanin and produced by crossing broccoli with a wild Brassica variety, Brassica oleracea var villosa.|broccoli
The majority of broccoli cultivars are cool-weather crops that do poorly in hot summer weather|broccoli
Broccoli grows best when exposed to an average daily temperature between 18 and 23 °C (64 and 73 °F)|broccoli
"When the cluster of flowers, also referred to as a ""head"" of broccoli, appear in the center of the plant, the cluster is generally green"|broccoli
Garden pruners or shears are used to cut the head about 25 mm (1 in) from the tip|broccoli
Broccoli should be harvested before the flowers on the head bloom bright yellow.|broccoli
In 2019, global production of broccoli (combined for production reports with cauliflowers) was 27 million tonnes, with China and India together accounting for 73% of the world total|broccoli
Secondary producers, each having about one million tonnes or less annually, were the United States, Spain, and Mexico.|broccoli
A 100 gram reference serving of raw broccoli provides 34 calories and is a rich source (20% or higher of the Daily Value, DV) of vitamin C (107% DV) and vitamin K (97% DV) (table)|broccoli
Raw broccoli also contains moderate amounts (10–19% DV) of several B vitamins and the dietary mineral manganese, whereas other micronutrients are low in content (less than 10% DV)|broccoli
Raw broccoli is 89% water, 7% carbohydrates, 3% protein, and contains negligible fat (table).|broccoli
The perceived bitterness of cruciferous vegetables, such as broccoli, results from glucosinolates and their hydrolysis products, particularly isothiocyanates and other sulfur-containing compounds|broccoli
Preliminary research indicates that genetic inheritance through the gene TAS2R38 may be responsible in part for bitter taste perception in broccoli.|broccoli
Cabbage, comprising several cultivars of Brassica oleracea, is a leafy green, red (purple), or white (pale green) biennial plant grown as an annual vegetable crop for its dense-leaved heads|cabbage
It is descended from the wild cabbage (B|cabbage
oleracea var|cabbage
"oleracea), and belongs to the ""cole crops"" or brassicas, meaning it is closely related to broccoli and cauliflower (var"|cabbage
botrytis); Brussels sprouts (var|cabbage
gemmifera); and Savoy cabbage (var|cabbage
sabauda).|cabbage
A cabbage generally weighs between 500 to 1,000 grams (1 to 2 lb)|cabbage
Smooth-leafed, firm-headed green cabbages are the most common, with smooth-leafed purple cabbages and crinkle-leafed savoy cabbages of both colours being rarer|cabbage
Under conditions of long sunny days, such as those found at high northern latitudes in summer, cabbages can grow quite large|cabbage
As of 2012, the heaviest cabbage was 62.71 kilograms (138 lb 4 oz)|cabbage
Cabbage heads are generally picked during the first year of the plant's life cycle, but plants intended for seed are allowed to grow a second year and must be kept separate from other cole crops to prevent cross-pollination|cabbage
Cabbage is prone to several nutrient deficiencies, as well as to multiple pests, and bacterial and fungal diseases.|cabbage
Cabbage was most likely domesticated somewhere in Europe before 1000 BC, although savoys were not developed until the 16th century AD|cabbage
By the Middle Ages, cabbage had become a prominent part of European cuisine|cabbage
They can be prepared many different ways for eating; they can be pickled, fermented (for dishes such as sauerkraut), steamed, stewed, sautéed, braised, or eaten raw|cabbage
Cabbage is a good source of vitamin K, vitamin C and dietary fiber|cabbage
World production of cabbage and other brassicas for 2018 was 69 million tonnes, and China accounts for 48% of the total.|cabbage
Cabbage (Brassica oleracea or B|cabbage
oleracea var|cabbage
capitata, var|cabbage
tuba, var|cabbage
sabauda or var|cabbage
acephala) is a member of the genus Brassica and the mustard family, Brassicaceae|cabbage
Several other cruciferous vegetables (sometimes known as cole crops) are cultivars of B|cabbage
oleracea, including broccoli, collard greens, brussels sprouts, kohlrabi and sprouting broccoli|cabbage
All of these developed from the wild cabbage B|cabbage
oleracea var|cabbage
oleracea, also called colewort or field cabbage|cabbage
"This original species evolved over thousands of years into those seen today, as selection resulted in cultivars having different characteristics, such as large heads for cabbage, large leaves for kale and thick stems with flower buds for broccoli.The varietal epithet capitata is derived from the Latin word for ""having a head"".""Cabbage"" was originally used to refer to multiple forms of B"|cabbage
oleracea, including those with loose or non-existent heads|cabbage
A related species, Brassica rapa, is commonly named Chinese, napa or celery cabbage, and has many of the same uses|cabbage
It is also a part of common names for several unrelated species|cabbage
These include cabbage bark or cabbage tree (a member of the genus Andira) and cabbage palms, which include several genera of palms such as Mauritia, Roystonea oleracea, Acrocomia and Euterpe oenocarpus.The original family name of brassicas was Cruciferae, which derived from the flower petal pattern thought by medieval Europeans to resemble a crucifix|cabbage
The word brassica derives from bresic, a Celtic word for cabbage|cabbage
"Many European and Asiatic names for cabbage are derived from the Celto-Slavic root cap or kap, meaning ""head"""|cabbage
"The late Middle English word cabbage derives from the word caboche (""head""), from the Picard dialect of Old French"|cabbage
This in turn is a variant of the Old French caboce|cabbage
"Through the centuries, ""cabbage"" and its derivatives have been used as slang for numerous items, occupations and activities"|cabbage
"Cash and tobacco have both been described by the slang ""cabbage"", while ""cabbage-head"" means a fool or stupid person and ""cabbaged"" means to be exhausted or, vulgarly, in a vegetative state."|cabbage
Cabbage seedlings have a thin taproot and cordate (heart-shaped) cotyledons|cabbage
The first leaves produced are ovate (egg-shaped) with a lobed petiole|cabbage
Plants are 40–60 cm (16–24 in) tall in their first year at the mature vegetative stage, and 1.5–2.0 m (4 ft 11 in–6 ft 7 in) tall when flowering in the second year|cabbage
Heads average between 0.5 and 4 kg (1 and 8 lb), with fast-growing, earlier-maturing varieties producing smaller heads|cabbage
Most cabbages have thick, alternating leaves, with margins that range from wavy or lobed to highly dissected; some varieties have a waxy bloom on the leaves|cabbage
Plants have root systems that are fibrous and shallow|cabbage
About 90 percent of the root mass is in the upper 20–30 cm (8–12 in) of soil; some lateral roots can penetrate up to 2 m (6 ft 7 in) deep.The inflorescence is an unbranched and indeterminate terminal raceme measuring 50–100 cm (20–40 in) tall, with flowers that are yellow or white|cabbage
Each flower has four petals set in a perpendicular pattern, as well as four sepals, six stamens, and a superior ovary that is two-celled and contains a single stigma and style|cabbage
Two of the six stamens have shorter filaments|cabbage
The fruit is a silique that opens at maturity through dehiscence to reveal brown or black seeds that are small and round in shape|cabbage
Self-pollination is impossible, and plants are cross-pollinated by insects|cabbage
The initial leaves form a rosette shape comprising 7 to 15 leaves, each measuring 25–35 cm (10–14 in) by 20–30 cm (8–12 in); after this, leaves with shorter petioles develop and heads form through the leaves cupping inward.Many shapes, colors and leaf textures are found in various cultivated varieties of cabbage|cabbage
Leaf types are generally divided between crinkled-leaf, loose-head savoys and smooth-leaf firm-head cabbages, while the color spectrum includes white and a range of greens and purples|cabbage
Oblate, round and pointed shapes are found.Cabbage has been selectively bred for head weight and morphological characteristics, frost hardiness, fast growth and storage ability|cabbage
The appearance of the cabbage head has been given importance in selective breeding, with varieties being chosen for shape, color, firmness and other physical characteristics|cabbage
Breeding objectives are now focused on increasing resistance to various insects and diseases and improving the nutritional content of cabbage|cabbage
Scientific research into the genetic modification of B|cabbage
oleracea crops, including cabbage, has included European Union and United States explorations of greater insect and herbicide resistance.There are several Guinness Book of World Records entries related to cabbage|cabbage
These include the heaviest cabbage, at 62.71 kg (138 lb 4 oz), heaviest red cabbage, at 31.6 kilograms (69 lb 11 oz), longest cabbage roll, at 19.54 m (64 ft 1+1⁄2 in), and the largest cabbage dish, at 2,960 kg (6,526 lb).|cabbage
"Although cabbage has an extensive history, it is difficult to trace its exact origins owing to the many varieties of leafy greens classified as ""brassicas"""|cabbage
A possible wild ancestor of cabbage, Brassica oleracea, originally found in Britain and continental Europe, is tolerant of salt but not encroachment by other plants and consequently inhabits rocky cliffs in cool damp coastal habitats, retaining water and nutrients in its slightly thickened, turgid leaves|cabbage
However, genetic analysis is consistent with feral origin of this population, deriving from plants escaped from field and gardens|cabbage
According to the triangle of U theory of the evolution and relationships between Brassica species, B|cabbage
oleracea and other closely related kale vegetables (cabbages, kale, broccoli, Brussels sprouts, and cauliflower) represent one of three ancestral lines from which all other brassicas originated.Cabbage was probably domesticated later in history than Near Eastern crops such as lentils and summer wheat|cabbage
Because of the wide range of crops developed from the wild B|cabbage
oleracea, multiple broadly contemporaneous domestications of cabbage may have occurred throughout Europe|cabbage
"Nonheading cabbages and kale were probably the first to be domesticated, before 1000 BC, perhaps by the Celts of central and western Europe, although recent linguistic and genetic evidence enforces a Mediterranean origin of cultivated brassicas.While unidentified brassicas were part of the highly conservative unchanging Mesopotamian garden repertory, it is believed that the ancient Egyptians did not cultivate cabbage, which is not native to the Nile valley, though the word shaw't in Papyrus Harris of the time of Ramesses III has been interpreted as ""cabbage"""|cabbage
The ancient Greeks had some varieties of cabbage, as mentioned by Theophrastus, although whether they were more closely related to today's cabbage or to one of the other Brassica crops is unknown|cabbage
The headed cabbage variety was known to the Greeks as krambe and to the Romans as brassica or olus; the open, leafy variety (kale) was known in Greek as raphanos and in Latin as caulis|cabbage
Ptolemaic Egyptians knew the cole crops as gramb, under the influence of Greek krambe, which had been a familiar plant to the Macedonian antecedents of the Ptolemies|cabbage
By early Roman times, Egyptian artisans and children were eating cabbage and turnips among a wide variety of other vegetables and pulses.Chrysippus of Cnidos wrote a treatise on cabbage, which Pliny knew, but it has not survived|cabbage
The Greeks were convinced that cabbages and grapevines were inimical, and that cabbage planted too near the vine would impart its unwelcome odor to the grapes; this Mediterranean sense of antipathy survives today.Brassica was considered by some Romans a table luxury,  although Lucullus considered it unfit for the senatorial table|cabbage
The more traditionalist Cato the Elder, espousing a simple Republican life, ate his cabbage cooked or raw and dressed with vinegar; he said it surpassed all other vegetables, and approvingly distinguished three varieties; he also gave directions for its medicinal use, which extended to the cabbage-eater's urine, in which infants might be rinsed|cabbage
"Pliny the Elder listed seven varieties, including Pompeii cabbage, Cumae cabbage and Sabellian cabbage.According to Pliny, the Pompeii cabbage, which could not stand cold, is ""taller, and has a thick stock near the root, but grows thicker between the leaves, these being scantier and narrower, but their tenderness is a valuable quality"""|cabbage
The Pompeii cabbage was also mentioned by Columella in De Re Rustica|cabbage
Apicius gives several recipes for cauliculi, tender cabbage shoots|cabbage
The Greeks and Romans claimed medicinal usages for their cabbage varieties that included relief from gout, headaches and the symptoms of poisonous mushroom ingestion.The antipathy towards the vine made it seem that eating cabbage would enable one to avoid drunkenness|cabbage
Cabbage continued to figure in the materia medica of antiquity as well as at table|cabbage
in the first century AD Dioscorides mentions two kinds of coleworts with medical uses, the cultivated and the wild, and his opinions continued to be paraphrased in herbals right through the 17th century.|cabbage
"At the end of Antiquity cabbage is mentioned in De observatione ciborum (""On the Observance of Foods"") by Anthimus, a Greek doctor at the court of Theodoric the Great"|cabbage
Cabbage appears among vegetables directed to be cultivated in the Capitulare de villis, composed in 771–800 AD, that guided the governance of the royal estates of Charlemagne.|cabbage
In Britain, the Anglo-Saxons cultivated cawel|cabbage
"When round-headed cabbages appeared in 14th-century England they were called cabaches and caboches, words drawn from Old French and applied at first to refer to the ball of unopened leaves,  the contemporaneous recipe that commences ""Take cabbages and quarter them, and seethe them in good broth"", also suggests the tightly headed cabbage."|cabbage
Manuscript illuminations show the prominence of cabbage in the cuisine of the High Middle Ages,  and cabbage seeds feature among the seed list of purchases for the use of King John II of France when captive in England in 1360, but cabbages were also a familiar staple of the poor|cabbage
"in the lean year of 1420 the ""Bourgeois of Paris"" noted that ""poor people ate no bread, nothing but cabbages and turnips and such dishes, without any bread or salt"""|cabbage
"French naturalist Jean Ruel made what is considered the first explicit mention of head cabbage in his 1536 botanical treatise De Natura Stirpium, referring to it as capucos coles (""head-coles"").In Istanbul, Sultan Selim III penned a tongue-in-cheek ode to cabbage"|cabbage
without cabbage, the halva feast was not complete|cabbage
In India, cabbage was one of several vegetable crops introduced by colonizing traders from Portugal, who established trade routes from the 14th to 17th centuries|cabbage
Carl Peter Thunberg reported that cabbage was not yet known in Japan in 1775.Many cabbage varieties—including some still commonly grown—were introduced in Germany, France, and the Low Countries|cabbage
During the 16th century, German gardeners developed the savoy cabbage|cabbage
During the 17th and 18th centuries, cabbage was a food staple in such countries as Germany, England, Ireland and Russia, and pickled cabbage was frequently eaten|cabbage
Sauerkraut was used by Dutch, Scandinavian and German sailors to prevent scurvy during long ship voyages.Jacques Cartier first brought cabbage to the Americas in 1541–42, and it was probably planted by the early English colonists, despite the lack of written evidence of its existence there until the mid-17th century|cabbage
By the 18th century, it was commonly planted by both colonists and native American Indians|cabbage
Cabbage seeds traveled to Australia in 1788 with the First Fleet, and were planted the same year on Norfolk Island|cabbage
It became a favorite vegetable of Australians by the 1830s and was frequently seen at the Sydney Markets.|cabbage
An traditional and very old, street, open air market|cabbage
Zelný trh (Cabbage market) in Brno, Moravia, Czech republic is named only by cabbage since 1325 (700 year) years.|cabbage
Cabbage is generally grown for its densely leaved heads, produced during the first year of its biennial cycle|cabbage
Plants perform best when grown in well-drained soil in a location that receives full sun|cabbage
Different varieties prefer different soil types, ranging from lighter sand to heavier clay, but all prefer fertile ground with a pH between 6.0 and 6.8|cabbage
For optimal growth, there must be adequate levels of nitrogen in the soil, especially during the early head formation stage, and sufficient phosphorus and potassium during the early stages of expansion of the outer leaves.Temperatures between 4 and 24 °C (39 and 75 °F) prompt the best growth, and extended periods of higher or lower temperatures may result in premature bolting (flowering)|cabbage
Flowering induced by periods of low temperatures (a process called vernalization) only occurs if the plant is past the juvenile period|cabbage
The transition from a juvenile to adult state happens when the stem diameter is about 6 mm (1⁄4 in)|cabbage
Vernalization allows the plant to grow to an adequate size before flowering|cabbage
In certain climates, cabbage can be planted at the beginning of the cold period and survive until a later warm period without being induced to flower, a practice that was common in the eastern US.|cabbage
Plants are generally started in protected locations early in the growing season before being transplanted outside, although some are seeded directly into the ground from which they will be harvested|cabbage
Seedlings typically emerge in about 4–6 days from seeds planted 13 mm (1⁄2 in) deep at a soil temperature between 20 and 30 °C (68 and 86 °F)|cabbage
Growers normally place plants 30 to 61 cm (12 to 24 in) apart|cabbage
"Closer spacing reduces the resources available to each plant (especially the amount of light) and increases the time taken to reach maturity.Some varieties of cabbage have been developed for ornamental use; these are generally called ""flowering cabbage"""|cabbage
They do not produce heads and feature purple or green outer leaves surrounding an inner grouping of smaller leaves in white, red, or pink|cabbage
Early varieties of cabbage take about 70 days from planting to reach maturity, while late varieties take about 120 days.Cabbages are mature when they are firm and solid to the touch|cabbage
They are harvested by cutting the stalk just below the bottom leaves with a blade|cabbage
The outer leaves are trimmed, and any diseased, damaged, or necrotic leaves are removed|cabbage
Delays in harvest can result in the head splitting as a result of expansion of the inner leaves and continued stem growth.When being grown for seed, cabbages must be isolated from other B|cabbage
oleracea subspecies, including the wild varieties, by 0.8 to 1.6 km (1⁄2 to 1 mi) to prevent cross-pollination|cabbage
Other Brassica species, such as B|cabbage
rapa, B|cabbage
juncea, B|cabbage
nigra, B|cabbage
napus and Raphanus sativus, do not readily cross-pollinate.|cabbage
White, also called Dutch – Smooth, pale green leavesSome sources only delineate three cultivars|cabbage
savoy, red and white, with spring greens and green cabbage being subsumed under the last.|cabbage
Due to its high level of nutrient requirements, cabbage is prone to nutrient deficiencies, including boron, calcium, phosphorus and potassium|cabbage
There are several physiological disorders that can affect the postharvest appearance of cabbage|cabbage
Internal tip burn occurs when the margins of inside leaves turn brown, but the outer leaves look normal|cabbage
Necrotic spot is where there are oval sunken spots a few millimeters across that are often grouped around the midrib|cabbage
In pepper spot, tiny black spots occur on the areas between the veins, which can increase during storage.Fungal diseases include wirestem, which causes weak or dying transplants; Fusarium yellows, which result in stunted and twisted plants with yellow leaves; and blackleg (see Leptosphaeria maculans), which leads to sunken areas on stems and gray-brown spotted leaves|cabbage
The fungi Alternaria brassicae and A|cabbage
brassicicola cause dark leaf spots in affected plants|cabbage
They are both seedborne and airborne, and typically propagate from spores in infected plant debris left on the soil surface for up to twelve weeks after harvest|cabbage
"Rhizoctonia solani causes the post-emergence disease wirestem, resulting in killed seedlings (""damping-off""), root rot or stunted growth and smaller heads."|cabbage
One of the most common bacterial diseases to affect cabbage is black rot, caused by  Xanthomonas campestris, which causes chlorotic and necrotic lesions that start at the leaf margins, and wilting of plants|cabbage
Clubroot, caused by the soilborne slime mold-like organism Plasmodiophora brassicae, results in swollen, club-like roots|cabbage
Downy mildew, a parasitic disease caused by the oomycete Peronospora parasitica, produces pale leaves with white, brownish or olive mildew on the lower leaf surfaces; this is often confused with the fungal disease powdery mildew.Pests include root-knot nematodes and cabbage maggots, which produce stunted and wilted plants with yellow leaves; aphids, which induce stunted plants with curled and yellow leaves; harlequin cabbage bugs, which cause white and yellow leaves; thrips, which lead to leaves with white-bronze spots; striped flea beetles, which riddle leaves with small holes; and caterpillars, which leave behind large, ragged holes in leaves|cabbage
"The caterpillar stage of the ""small cabbage white butterfly"" (Pieris rapae), commonly known in the United States as the ""imported cabbage worm"", is a major cabbage pest in most countries.The large white butterfly (Pieris brassicae) is prevalent in eastern European countries"|cabbage
The diamondback moth (Plutella xylostella) and the cabbage moth (Mamestra brassicae) thrive in the higher summer temperatures of continental Europe, where they cause considerable damage to cabbage crops|cabbage
The cabbage looper (Trichoplusia ni) is infamous in North America for its voracious appetite and for producing frass that contaminates plants|cabbage
In India, the diamondback moth has caused losses up to 90 percent in crops that were not treated with insecticide|cabbage
Destructive soil insects include the cabbage root fly (Delia radicum) and the cabbage maggot (Hylemya brassicae), whose larvae can burrow into the part of plant consumed by humans.Planting near other members of the cabbage family, or where these plants have been placed in previous years, can prompt the spread of pests and disease|cabbage
Excessive water and excessive heat can also cause cultivation problems.Factors that contribute to reduced head weight include|cabbage
growth in the compacted soils that result from no-till farming practices, drought, waterlogging, insect and disease incidence, and shading and nutrient stress caused by weeds.|cabbage
In 2018, world production of cabbages (combined with other brassicas) was 69.4 million tonnes, led by China with 48% of the world total (table)|cabbage
Other major producers were India, South Korea, and Russia.|cabbage
Cabbages sold for market are generally smaller, and different varieties are used for those sold immediately upon harvest and those stored before sale|cabbage
Those used for processing, especially sauerkraut, are larger and have a lower percentage of water|cabbage
Both hand and mechanical harvesting are used, and hand-harvesting is generally used for cabbages destined for market sales|cabbage
In commercial-scale operations, hand-harvested cabbages are trimmed, sorted, and packed directly in the field to increase efficiency.Vacuum cooling rapidly refrigerates the vegetable, allowing for earlier shipping and a fresher product|cabbage
Cabbage can be stored the longest at −1 to 2 °C (30 to 36 °F) with a humidity of 90–100 percent; these conditions will result in up to six months of longevity|cabbage
When stored under less ideal conditions, cabbage can still last up to four months.|cabbage
Cabbage consumption varies widely around the world|cabbage
Russia has the highest annual per capita consumption at 20 kg (44 lb), followed by Belgium at 4.7 kg (10 lb 6 oz) and the Netherlands at 4.0 kg (8 lb 13 oz)|cabbage
Americans consume 3.9 kg (8.6 lb) annually per capita.|cabbage
Cabbage is prepared and consumed in many ways|cabbage
The simplest options include eating the vegetable raw or steaming it, though many cuisines pickle, stew, sautée or braise cabbage|cabbage
Pickling is a common way of preserving cabbage, creating dishes such as sauerkraut and kimchi, although kimchi is more often made from Chinese cabbage (B|cabbage
rapa subsp|cabbage
pekinensis)|cabbage
Savoy cabbages are usually used in salads, while smooth-leaf types are utilized for both market sales and processing|cabbage
Bean curd and cabbage is a staple of Chinese cooking, while the British dish bubble and squeak is made primarily with leftover potato and boiled cabbage and eaten with cold meat.In Poland, cabbage is one of the main food crops, and it features prominently in Polish cuisine|cabbage
It is frequently eaten, either cooked or as sauerkraut, as a side dish or as an ingredient in such dishes as bigos (cabbage, sauerkraut, meat, and wild mushrooms, among other ingredients) gołąbki (stuffed cabbage) and pierogi (filled dumplings)|cabbage
Other eastern European countries, such as Hungary and Romania, also have traditional dishes that feature cabbage as a main ingredient|cabbage
In India and Ethiopia, cabbage is often included in spicy salads and braises|cabbage
In the United States, cabbage is used primarily for the production of coleslaw, followed by market use and sauerkraut production.|cabbage
The characteristic flavor of cabbage is caused by glucosinolates, a class of sulfur-containing glucosides|cabbage
Although found throughout the plant, these compounds are concentrated in the highest quantities in the seeds; lesser quantities are found in young vegetative tissue, and they decrease as the tissue ages|cabbage
Cooked cabbage is often criticized for its pungent, unpleasant odor and taste|cabbage
These develop when cabbage is overcooked and hydrogen sulfide gas is produced.|cabbage
Raw cabbage is 92% water, 6% carbohydrates, 1% protein, and contains negligible fat (table)|cabbage
In a 100 gram reference amount, raw cabbage is a rich source of vitamin C and vitamin K, containing 44% and 72%, respectively, of the Daily Value (DV)|cabbage
Cabbage is also a moderate source (10–19% DV) of vitamin B6 and folate, with no other nutrients having significant content per 100-gram serving (table).|cabbage
Basic research on cabbage phytochemicals is ongoing to discern if certain cabbage compounds may affect health or have potential for anti-disease effects, such as sulforaphane and other glucosinolates|cabbage
Studies on cruciferous vegetables, including cabbage, include whether they may lower the risk against colon cancer|cabbage
Cabbage is a source of indole-3-carbinol, a chemical under basic research for its possible properties.|cabbage
In addition to its usual purpose as an edible vegetable, cabbage has been used historically in herbalism|cabbage
The Ancient Greeks recommended consuming the vegetable as a laxative, and used cabbage juice as an antidote for mushroom poisoning, for eye salves, and for liniments for bruises|cabbage
The ancient Roman, Pliny the Elder, described both culinary and medicinal properties of the vegetable|cabbage
Ancient Egyptians ate cooked cabbage at the beginning of meals to reduce the intoxicating effects of wine|cabbage
This traditional usage persisted in European literature until the mid-20th century.The cooling properties of the leaves were used in Britain as a treatment for trench foot in World War I, and as compresses for ulcers and breast abscesses|cabbage
Other medicinal uses recorded in European folk medicine include treatments for rheumatism, sore throat, hoarseness, colic, and melancholy|cabbage
Both mashed cabbage and cabbage juice have been used in poultices to remove boils and treat warts, pneumonia, appendicitis, and ulcers|cabbage
As of 2019, there is no clinical evidence that cabbage has any medicinal properties.|cabbage
Excessive consumption of cabbage may lead to increased intestinal gas which causes bloating and flatulence due to the trisaccharide raffinose, which the human small intestine cannot digest, but is digested by bacteria in the large intestine.Cabbage has been linked to outbreaks of some food-borne illnesses, including Listeria monocytogenes and Clostridium botulinum|cabbage
The latter toxin has been traced to pre-made, packaged coleslaw mixes, while the spores were found on whole cabbages that were otherwise acceptable in appearance|cabbage
Shigella species are able to survive in shredded cabbage|cabbage
Two outbreaks of E|cabbage
coli in the United States have been linked to cabbage consumption|cabbage
Biological risk assessments have concluded that there is the potential for further outbreaks linked to uncooked cabbage, due to contamination at many stages of the growing, harvesting and packaging processes|cabbage
Contaminants from water, humans, animals and soil have the potential to be transferred to cabbage, and from there to the end consumer.Cabbage and other cruciferous vegetables contain small amounts of thiocyanate, a compound associated with goiter formation when iodine intake is deficient.|cabbage

How to Grow Them by James John Howard Gregory – Project Gutenberg.|cabbage
The radish (Raphanus raphanistrum subsp|radish
sativus) is an edible root vegetable of the family Brassicaceae that was domesticated in Asia prior to Roman times.|radish
Radishes are grown and consumed throughout the world, being mostly eaten raw as a crunchy salad vegetable with a pungent flavor|radish
There are numerous varieties, varying in size, flavor, color, and length of time they take to mature|radish
Radishes owe their sharp flavor to the various chemical compounds produced by the plants, including glucosinolate, myrosinase, and isothiocyanate|radish
They are sometimes grown as companion plants and suffer from few pests and diseases|radish
They germinate quickly and grow rapidly, common smaller varieties being ready for consumption within a month, while larger daikon varieties take several months|radish
Being easy to grow and quick to harvest, radishes are often planted by novice gardeners|radish
Another use of radish is as a cover or catch crop in winter, or as a forage crop|radish
Some radishes are grown for their seeds; others, such as daikon, may be grown for oil production|radish
Others are used for sprouting.|radish
Varieties of radish are now broadly distributed around the world, but almost no archeological records are available to help determine their early history and domestication|radish
However, scientists have tentatively located the origin of Raphanus sativus in Southeast Asia, as this is the only region where truly wild forms have been discovered|radish
India, central China, and Central Asia appear to have been secondary centers where differing forms were developed|radish
Radishes enter the historical record in third century BC|radish
Greek and Roman agriculturalists of the first century AD gave details of small, large, round, long, mild, and sharp varieties|radish
The radish seems to have been one of the first European crops introduced to the Americas|radish
A German botanist reported radishes of 45 kilograms (100 pounds) and roughly 90 centimetres (3 feet) in length in 1544, although the only variety of that size today is the Japanese Sakurajima radish|radish
The large, mild, and white East Asian form was developed in China, though it is mostly associated in the West with the Japanese daikon, owing to Japanese agricultural development and larger exports.|radish
Radishes are annual or biennial brassicaceous crops grown for their swollen tap roots which can be globular, tapering, or cylindrical|radish
The root skin colour ranges from white through pink, red, purple, yellow, and green to black, but the flesh is usually white|radish
The roots obtain their color from anthocyanins|radish
Red varieties use the anthocyanin pelargonidin as a pigment, and purple cultivars obtain their color from cyanidin|radish
Smaller types have a few leaves about 13 cm (5 in) long with round roots up to 2.5 cm (1 in) in diameter or more slender, long roots up to 7 cm (3 in) long|radish
Both of these are normally eaten raw in salads|radish
A longer root form, including oriental radishes, daikon or mooli, and winter radishes, grows up to 60 cm (24 in) long with foliage about 60 cm (24 in) high with a spread of 45 cm (18 in)|radish
The flesh of radishes harvested timely is crisp and sweet, but becomes bitter and tough if the vegetable is left in the ground too long|radish
Leaves are arranged in a rosette|radish
They have a lyrate shape, meaning they are divided pinnately with an enlarged terminal lobe and smaller lateral lobes|radish
The white flowers are borne on a racemose inflorescence|radish
The fruits are small pods which can be eaten when young.The radish is a diploid species, and has 18 chromosomes (2n=18)|radish
It is estimated that the radish genome contains between 526 and 574 Mb.|radish
Radishes are a fast-growing, annual, cool-season crop|radish
The seed germinates in three to four days in moist conditions with soil temperatures between 18 and 29 °C (65 and 85 °F)|radish
Best quality roots are obtained under moderate day lengths with air temperatures in the range 10 to 18 °C (50 to 65 °F)|radish
Under average conditions, the crop matures in 3–4 weeks, but in colder weather, 6–7 weeks may be required.Radishes grow best in full sun in light, sandy loams, with a soil pH 6.5 to 7.0, but for late-season crops, a clayey-loam is ideal|radish
Soils that bake dry and form a crust in dry weather are unsuitable and can impair germination|radish
Harvesting periods can be extended by making repeat plantings, spaced a week or two apart|radish
In warmer climates, radishes are normally planted in the autumn|radish
The depth at which seeds are planted affects the size of the root, from 1 cm (1⁄2 in) deep recommended for small radishes to 4 cm (1+1⁄2 in) for large radishes|radish
During the growing period, the crop needs to be thinned and weeds controlled, and irrigation may be required.|radish
Radishes are a common garden crop in many parts of the world, and the fast harvest cycle makes them particularly suitable for children's gardens|radish
After harvesting, radishes can be stored without loss of quality for two or three days at room temperature, and about two months at 0 °C (32 °F) with a relative humidity of 90–95%.|radish
Radishes can be useful as companion plants for many other crops, probably because their pungent odour deters such insect pests as aphids, cucumber beetles, tomato hornworms, squash bugs, and ants|radish
They can also function as a trap crop, luring insect pests away from the main crop|radish
Cucumbers and radishes seem to thrive when grown in close association with each other, and radishes also grow well with chervil, lettuce, peas, and nasturtiums|radish
However, they react adversely to growing in close association with hyssop.|radish
As a fast-growing plant, diseases are not generally a problem with radishes, but some insect pests can be a nuisance|radish
"The larvae of flea beetles (Delia radicum) live in the soil, but the adult beetles cause damage to the crop, biting small ""shot holes"" in the leaves, especially of seedlings"|radish
The swede midge (Contarinia nasturtii) attacks the foliage and growing tip of the plant and causes distortion, multiple (or no) growing tips, and swollen or crinkled leaves and stems|radish
The larvae of the cabbage root fly sometimes attack the roots|radish
The foliage droops and becomes discoloured, and small, white maggots tunnel through the root, making it unattractive or inedible.|radish
'Bunny Tail' is an heirloom variety from Italy, where it is known as Rosso Tondo A Piccola Punta Bianca|radish
It is slightly oblong, mostly red, with a white tip.|radish
'Cherry Belle' is a bright red-skinned round variety with a white interior|radish
It is familiar in North American supermarkets.|radish
'Sicily Giant' is a large heirloom variety from Sicily|radish
It can reach up to 5 cm (2 in) in diameter.|radish
'White Icicle' or 'Icicle' is a white carrot-shaped variety, around 10–12 cm (4–5 in) long, dating back to the 16th century|radish
It slices easily, and has better than average resistance to pithiness.|radish
'French Breakfast' is an elongated, red-skinned radish with a white splash at the root end|radish
It is typically slightly milder than other summer varieties, but is among the quickest to turn pithy.|radish
'Easter Egg' is not an actual variety, but a mix of varieties with different skin colors, typically including white, pink, red, and purple radishes|radish
Sold in markets or seed packets under the name, the seed mixes can extend harvesting duration from a single planting, as different varieties may mature at different times.|radish
'Black Spanish' or 'Black Spanish Round' occur in both round and elongated forms, and are sometimes simply called the black radish (Raphanus sativus L|radish
var|radish
niger (M.) S.K|radish
or L|radish
ssp|radish
niger (M.)|radish
D.C|radish
var|radish
albus D.C) or known by the French name Gros Noir d'Hiver|radish
It dates in Europe to 1548, and was a common garden variety in England and France during the early 19th century|radish
It has a rough, black skin with hot-flavored, white flesh, is round or irregularly pear shaped, and grows to around 10 cm (4 in) in diameter.Daikon refers to a wide variety of winter oilseed radishes from Asia|radish
While the Japanese name daikon has been adopted in English, it is also sometimes called the Japanese radish, Chinese radish, Oriental radish or mooli (in India and South Asia)|radish
Daikon commonly have elongated white roots, although many varieties of daikon exist|radish
One well-known variety is 'April Cross', with smooth white roots|radish
The New York Times describes 'Masato Red' and 'Masato Green' varieties as extremely long, well-suited for fall planting and winter storage|radish
The Sakurajima radish is a hot-flavored variety which is typically grown to around 10 kg (22 lb), but which can grow to 30 kg (66 lb) when left in the ground.Korean radish, also called mu(무), is a variety of white radish with firm crunchy texture|radish
Although mu is also a generic term for radishes in Korean (as daikon is a generic term for radishes in Japanese), the word is usually used in its narrow sense, referring to Joseon radish(조선무, Joseonmu)|radish
In Korean cuisine context, the word Joseon is often used in contrast to Wae, to distinguish Korean varieties from Japanese ones|radish
The longer, thinner, and waterier Japanese daikon cultivated mainly for danmuji is referred to as Wae radish(왜무, Waemu) in Korea|radish
Korean radishes are generally shorter, stouter, and sturdier than daikon, and have pale green shade halfway down from the top|radish
They also have stronger flavour, denser flesh and softer leaves|radish
The greens of Korean radishes are called mucheong(무청) and used as vegetable in various dishes.|radish
"The seeds of radishes grow in siliques (widely referred to as ""pods""), following flowering that happens when left to grow past their normal harvesting period"|radish
The seeds are edible, and are sometimes used as a crunchy, sharp addition to salads|radish
Some varieties are grown specifically for their seeds or seed pods, rather than their roots|radish
The rat-tailed radish, an old European variety thought to have come from East Asia centuries ago, has long, thin, curly pods which can exceed 20 cm (8 in) in length|radish
In the 17th century, the pods were often pickled and served with meat|radish
The 'München Bier' variety supplies seed pods that are sometimes served raw as an accompaniment to beer in Germany.|radish
In a 100-gram (3+1⁄2-ounce) reference serving, raw radishes provide 66 kilojoules (16 kilocalories) of food energy and have a moderate amount of vitamin C (18% of Daily Value), with other essential nutrients in low content (table)|radish
A raw radish is 95% water, 3% carbohydrates, 1% protein, and has negligible fat.|radish
The most commonly eaten portion is the napiform or fusiform taproot, although the entire plant is edible and the tops can be used as a leaf vegetable|radish
The seed can also be sprouted and eaten raw in a similar way to a mung bean.The root of the radish is usually eaten raw, although tougher specimens can be steamed|radish
The raw flesh has a crisp texture and a pungent, peppery flavor, caused by glucosinolates and the enzyme myrosinase, which combine when chewed to form allyl isothiocyanates, also present in mustard, horseradish, and wasabi.Radishes are mostly used in salads, but also appear in many European dishes|radish
In Mexican cuisine, sliced radishes are used in combination with shredded lettuce as garnish for traditional dishes such as tostadas, sopes, enchiladas and Posole stew.Radish greens are usually discarded, but are edible and nutritious, and can be prepared in a variety of ways|radish
The leaves are sometimes used in recipes, like potato soup or as a sauteed side dish|radish
"They are also found blended with fruit juices in some recipes.In Indian cuisine the seed pods are called ""moongra"" or ""mogri"" and can be used in many dishes."|radish
The seeds of radishes can be pressed to extract radish seed oil|radish
Wild radish seeds contain up to 48% oil, and while not suitable for human consumption, this oil is a potential source of biofuel|radish
"The daikon grows well in cool climates and, apart from its industrial use, can be used as a cover crop, grown to increase soil fertility, to scavenge nutrients, suppress weeds, help alleviate soil compaction, and prevent winter erosion of the soil.""Radi"", a spiral-cut radish that is sprinkled with salt and occasionally chives, and eaten with the fingers, is traditionally served with beer at the Bavarian Oktoberfest."|radish
The daikon varieties of radish are important parts of East, Southeast, and South Asian cuisine|radish
In Japan and Korea, radish dolls are sometimes made as children's toys|radish
Daikon is also one of the plants that make up the Japanese Festival of Seven Herbs (Nanakusa no sekku) on the seventh day after the new year.Citizens of Oaxaca, Mexico, celebrate the Night of the Radishes (Noche de los rábanos) on December 23 as a part of Christmas celebrations|radish
This folk art competition uses a large type of radish up to 50 cm (20 in) long and weighing up to 3 kg (7 lb)|radish
Great skill and ingenuity are used to carve these into religious and popular figures, buildings, and other objects, and they are displayed in the town square.|radish

Discovered Bibliography − Raphanus sativus|radish
The carrot (Daucus carota subsp|carrot
sativus) is a root vegetable, typically orange in color, though purple, black, red, white, and yellow cultivars exist, all of which are domesticated forms of the wild carrot, Daucus carota, native to Europe and Southwestern Asia|carrot
The plant probably originated in Persia and was originally cultivated for its leaves and seeds|carrot
The most commonly eaten part of the plant is the taproot, although the stems and leaves are also eaten|carrot
The domestic carrot has been selectively bred for its greatly enlarged, more palatable, less woody-textured taproot.|carrot
The carrot is a biennial plant in the umbellifer family, Apiaceae|carrot
At first, it grows a rosette of leaves while building up the enlarged taproot|carrot
Fast-growing cultivars mature within three months (90 days) of sowing the seed, while slower-maturing cultivars need a month longer (120 days)|carrot
The roots contain high quantities of alpha- and beta-carotene, and are a good source of vitamin K and vitamin B6.|carrot
The United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) reports that world production of carrots and turnips (these plants are combined by the FAO) for 2018 was 40 million tonnes, with 45% of the world total grown in China|carrot
Carrots are widely used in many cuisines, especially in the preparation of salads, and carrot salads are a tradition in many regional cuisines.|carrot
The word is first recorded in English circa 1530 and was borrowed from Middle French carotte, itself from Late Latin carōta, from ancient Greek καρωτόν karōtón), originally from the Proto-Indo-European root *ker- ('horn'), due to its horn-like shape|carrot
In Old English, carrots (typically white at the time) were not clearly distinguished from parsnips|carrot
the two were collectively called moru or more (from Proto-Indo-European *mork- 'edible root', cf|carrot
German Möhre or Russian морковь (morkov)).Various languages still use the same word for carrot as they do for root; e.g|carrot
Dutch wortel.|carrot
Both written history and molecular genetic studies indicate that the domestic carrot has a single origin in Central Asia|carrot
Its wild ancestors probably originated in Persia (regions of which are now Iran and Afghanistan), which remains the centre of diversity for the wild carrot Daucus carota|carrot
A naturally occurring subspecies of the wild carrot was presumably bred selectively over the centuries to reduce bitterness, increase sweetness and minimise the woody core; this process produced the familiar garden vegetable.When they were first cultivated, carrots were grown for their aromatic leaves and seeds rather than their roots|carrot
Carrot seeds have been found in Switzerland and Southern Germany dating back to 2000–3000 BC|carrot
Some close relatives of the carrot are still grown for their leaves and seeds, such as parsley, cilantro, coriander, fennel, anise, dill and cumin|carrot
The first mention of the root in classical sources is from the 1st century AD; the Romans ate a root vegetable called pastinaca, which may have been either the carrot or the closely related parsnip.The plant is depicted and described in the Eastern Roman Juliana Anicia Codex, a 6th-century AD Constantinopolitan copy of the Greek physician Dioscorides' 1st-century pharmacopoeia of herbs and medicines, De Materia Medica|carrot
"Three different types of carrots are depicted, and the text states that ""the root can be cooked and eaten"""|carrot
Another copy of this work, Codex Neapolitanes from late 6th or early 7th century, has basically the same illustrations but with roots in purple.The plant was introduced into Spain by the Moors in the 8th century|carrot
In the 10th century, roots from West Asia, India and Europe were purple|carrot
The modern carrot originated in Afghanistan at about this time|carrot
The 11th-century Jewish scholar Simeon Seth describes both red and yellow carrots, as does the 12th-century Arab-Andalusian agriculturist, Ibn al-'Awwam|carrot
Cultivated carrots appeared in China in the 12th century, and in Japan in the 16th or 17th century.There are many claims that Dutch growers created orange carrots in the 17th century to honor the Dutch flag at the time and William of Orange|carrot
Other authorities argue these claims lack convincing evidence|carrot
Modern carrots were described at about this time by the English antiquary John Aubrey (1626–1697)|carrot
"""Carrots were first sown at Beckington in Somersetshire"|carrot
"Some very old Man there [in 1668] did remember their first bringing hither."" European settlers introduced the carrot to colonial America in the 17th century.Outwardly purple carrots, still orange on the inside, were sold in British stores beginning in 2002."|carrot
Daucus carota is a biennial plant|carrot
In the first year, its rosette of leaves produces large amounts of sugars, which are stored in the taproot to provide energy for the plant to flower in the second year.|carrot
Soon after germination, carrot seedlings show a distinct demarcation between taproot and stem|carrot
the stem is thicker and lacks lateral roots|carrot
At the upper end of the stem is the seed leaf|carrot
The first true leaf appears about 10–15 days after germination|carrot
Subsequent leaves are alternate (with a single leaf attached to a node), spirally arranged, and pinnately compound, with leaf bases sheathing the stem|carrot
As the plant grows, the bases of the seed leaves, near the taproot, are pushed apart|carrot
The stem, located just above the ground, is compressed and the internodes are not distinct|carrot
When the seed stalk elongates for flowering, the tip of the stem narrows and becomes pointed, and the stem extends upward to become a highly branched inflorescence up to 60–200 cm (20–80 in) tall.Most of the taproot consists of a pulpy outer cortex (phloem) and an inner core (xylem)|carrot
High-quality carrots have a large proportion of cortex compared to core|carrot
Although a completely xylem-free carrot is not possible, some cultivars have small and deeply pigmented cores; the taproot can appear to lack a core when the colour of the cortex and core are similar in intensity|carrot
Taproots are typically long and conical, although cylindrical and nearly-spherical cultivars are available|carrot
The root diameter can range from 1 cm (3⁄8 in) to as much as 10 cm (4 in) at the widest part|carrot
The root length ranges from 5 to 50 cm (2 to 20 in), although most are between 10 and 25 cm (4 and 10 in).|carrot
Flower development begins when the flat meristem changes from producing leaves to an uplifted, conical meristem capable of producing stem elongation and a cluster of flowers|carrot
The cluster is a compound umbel, and each umbel contains several smaller umbels (umbellets)|carrot
The first (primary) umbel occurs at the end of the main floral stem; smaller secondary umbels grow from the main branch, and these further branch into third, fourth, and even later-flowering umbels.A large, primary umbel can contain up to 50 umbellets, each of which may have as many as 50 flowers; subsequent umbels have fewer flowers|carrot
Individual flowers are small and white, sometimes with a light green or yellow tint|carrot
They consist of five petals, five stamens, and an entire calyx|carrot
The stamens usually split and fall off before the stigma becomes receptive to receive pollen|carrot
The stamens of the brown, male, sterile flowers degenerate and shrivel before the flower fully opens|carrot
In the other type of male sterile flower, the stamens are replaced by petals, and these petals do not fall off|carrot
A nectar-containing disc is present on the upper surface of the carpels.|carrot
Flowers change sex in their development, so the stamens release their pollen before the stigma of the same flower is receptive|carrot
The arrangement is centripetal, meaning the oldest flowers are near the edge and the youngest flowers are in the center|carrot
Flowers usually first open at the outer edge of the primary umbel, followed about a week later on the secondary umbels, and then in subsequent weeks in higher-order umbels.The usual flowering period of individual umbels is 7 to 10 days, so a plant can be in the process of flowering for 30–50 days|carrot
The distinctive umbels and floral nectaries attract pollinating insects|carrot
After fertilization and as seeds develop, the outer umbellets of an umbel bend inward causing the umbel shape to change from slightly convex or fairly flat to concave, and when cupped it resembles a bird's nest.|carrot
The fruit that develops is a schizocarp consisting of two mericarps; each mericarp is a true seed|carrot
The paired mericarps are easily separated when they are dry|carrot
Premature separation (shattering) before harvest is undesirable because it can result in seed loss|carrot
Mature seeds are flattened on the commissural side that faced the septum of the ovary|carrot
The flattened side has five longitudinal ribs|carrot
The bristly hairs that protrude from some ribs are usually removed by abrasion during milling and cleaning|carrot
Seeds also contain oil ducts and canals|carrot
Seeds vary somewhat in size, ranging from less than 500 to more than 1000 seeds per gram.The carrot is a diploid species, and has nine relatively short, uniform-length chromosomes (2n=18)|carrot
The genome size is estimated to be 473 mega base pairs, which is four times larger than Arabidopsis thaliana, one-fifth the size of the maize genome, and about the same size as the rice genome.|carrot
Polyacetylenes can be found in Apiaceae vegetables like carrots where they show cytotoxic activities|carrot
Falcarinol and falcarindiol (cis-heptadeca-1,9-diene-4,6-diyne-3,8-diol) are such compounds|carrot
This latter compound shows antifungal activity towards Mycocentrospora acerina and Cladosporium cladosporioides|carrot
Falcarindiol is the main compound responsible for bitterness in carrots.Other compounds such as pyrrolidine (present in the leaves), 6-hydroxymellein, 6-methoxymellein, eugenin, 2,4,5-trimethoxybenzaldehyde (gazarin) or (Z)-3-acetoxy-heptadeca-1,9-diene-4,6-diin-8-ol (falcarindiol 3-acetate) can also be found in carrot.|carrot
Carrots are grown from seed and can take up to four months (120 days) to mature, but most cultivars mature within 70 to 80 days under the right conditions|carrot
They grow best in full sun but tolerate some shade|carrot
The optimum temperature is 16 to 21 °C (61 to 70 °F)|carrot
The ideal soil is deep, loose and well-drained, sandy or loamy, with a pH of 6.3 to 6.8.Fertilizer should be applied according to soil type because the crop requires low levels of nitrogen, moderate phosphate and high potash|carrot
Rich or rocky soils should be avoided, as these will cause the roots to become hairy and/or misshapen|carrot
Irrigation is applied when needed to keep the soil moist|carrot
After sprouting, the crop is eventually thinned to a spacing of 8 to 10 cm (3 to 4 in) and weeded to prevent competition beneath the soil.|carrot
There are several diseases that can reduce the yield and market value of carrots|carrot
The most devastating carrot disease is Alternaria leaf blight, which has been known to eradicate entire crops|carrot
A bacterial leaf blight caused by Xanthomonas campestris can also be destructive in warm, humid areas|carrot
Root knot nematodes (Meloidogyne species) can cause stubby or forked roots, or galls|carrot
Cavity spot, caused by the oomycetes Pythium violae and Pythium sulcatum, results in irregularly shaped, depressed lesions on the taproots.Physical damage can also reduce the value of carrot crops|carrot
The two main forms of damage are splitting, whereby a longitudinal crack develops during growth that can be a few centimetres to the entire length of the root, and breaking, which occurs postharvest|carrot
These disorders can affect over 30% of commercial crops|carrot
Factors associated with high levels of splitting include wide plant spacing, early sowing, lengthy growth durations, and genotype.|carrot
Carrots benefit from strongly scented companion plants|carrot
The pungent odour of onions, leeks and chives help repel the carrot root fly, and other vegetables that team well with carrots include lettuce, tomatoes and radishes, as well as the herbs rosemary and sage|carrot
Carrots thrive in the presence of caraway, coriander, chamomile, marigold and Swan River daisy|carrot
They can also be good companions for other plants; if left to flower, the carrot, like any umbellifer, attracts predatory wasps that kill many garden pests.|carrot
Carrot cultivars can be grouped into two broad classes, eastern carrots and western carrots|carrot
"A number of novelty cultivars have been bred for particular characteristics.""Eastern"" (a European and American continent reference) carrots were domesticated in Persia (probably in the lands of modern-day Iran and Afghanistan within West Asia) during the 10th century, or possibly earlier"|carrot
"Specimens of the ""eastern"" carrot that survive to the present day are commonly purple or yellow, and often have branched roots"|carrot
The purple colour common in these carrots comes from anthocyanin pigments.The western carrot emerged in the Netherlands in the 17th century|carrot
There is a popular belief that its orange colour making it popular in those countries as an emblem of the House of Orange and the struggle for Dutch independence, although there is little evidence for this|carrot
The orange colour results from abundant carotenes in these cultivars.|carrot
Western carrot cultivars are commonly classified by their root shape|carrot
The four general types are:|carrot
Chantenay carrots|carrot
Although the roots are shorter than other cultivars, they have vigorous foliage and greater girth, being broad in the shoulders and tapering towards a blunt, rounded tip|carrot
They store well, have a pale-coloured core and are mostly used for processing|carrot
Cultivars include 'Carson Hybrid' and 'Red Cored Chantenay'.|carrot
Danvers carrots|carrot
These have strong foliage and the roots are longer than Chantenay types, and they have a conical shape with a well-defined shoulder, tapering to a point|carrot
They are somewhat shorter than Imperator cultivars, but more tolerant of heavy soil conditions|carrot
Danvers cultivars store well and are used both fresh and for processing|carrot
They were developed in 1871 in Danvers, Massachusetts|carrot
Cultivars include 'Danvers Half Long' and 'Danvers 126'.|carrot
Imperator carrots|carrot
This cultivar has vigorous foliage, is of high sugar content, and has long and slender roots, tapering to a pointed tip|carrot
Imperator types are the most widely cultivated by commercial growers|carrot
Cultivars include 'Imperator 58' and 'Sugarsnax Hybrid'.|carrot
Nantes carrots|carrot
These have sparse foliage, are cylindrical, short with a more blunt tip than Imperator types, and attain high yields in a range of conditions|carrot
The skin is easily damaged and the core is deeply pigmented|carrot
They are brittle, high in sugar and store less well than other types|carrot
Cultivars include 'Nelson Hybrid', 'Scarlet Nantes' and 'Sweetness Hybrid'.Carrot breeding programs have developed new cultivars to have dense amounts of chemically-stable acylated pigments, such as anthocyanins, which enrich carrot color based on the density and types of anthocyanin to produce different carrot colors|carrot
One particular cultivar lacks the usual orange pigment due to carotene, owing its white colour to a recessive gene for tocopherol (vitamin E), but this cultivar and wild carrots do not provide nutritionally significant amounts of vitamin E.|carrot
In 2018, world production of carrots (combined with turnips) was 40 million tonnes, with China producing 45% of the world total (table)|carrot
Other major producers were the United States, Uzbekistan, and Russia.|carrot
Carrots can be stored for several months in the refrigerator or over winter in a moist, cool place|carrot
For long term storage, unwashed carrots can be placed in a bucket between layers of sand, a 50/50 mix of sand and wood shavings, or in soil|carrot
A temperature range of 0 to 4 °C (32 to 40 °F) and 98% humidity is best.|carrot
Carrots can be eaten in a variety of ways|carrot
Only 3 percent of the β-carotene in raw carrots is released during digestion|carrot
this can be improved to 39% by pulping, cooking and adding cooking oil|carrot
Alternatively they may be chopped and boiled, fried or steamed, and cooked in soups and stews, as well as baby and pet foods|carrot
A well-known dish is carrots julienne|carrot
Together with onion and celery, carrots are one of the primary vegetables used in a mirepoix to make various broths.The greens are edible as a leaf vegetable, but are rarely eaten by humans; some sources suggest that the greens contain toxic alkaloids|carrot
When used for this purpose, they are harvested young in high-density plantings, before significant root development, and typically used stir-fried, or in salads|carrot
Some people are allergic to carrots|carrot
In a 2010 study on the prevalence of food allergies in Europe, 3.6 percent of young adults showed some degree of sensitivity to carrots|carrot
Because the major carrot allergen, the protein Dauc c 1.0104, is cross-reactive with homologues in birch pollen (Bet v 1) and mugwort pollen (Art v 1), most carrot allergy sufferers are also allergic to pollen from these plants.In India carrots are used in a variety of ways, as salads or as vegetables added to spicy rice or dal dishes|carrot
A popular variation in north India is the Gajar Ka Halwa carrot dessert, which has carrots grated and cooked in milk until the whole mixture is solid, after which nuts and butter are added|carrot
Carrot salads are usually made with grated carrots with a seasoning of mustard seeds and green chillies popped in hot oil|carrot
Carrots can also be cut in thin strips and added to rice, can form part of a dish of mixed roast vegetables or can be blended with tamarind to make chutney.Since the late 1980s, baby carrots or mini-carrots (carrots that have been peeled and cut into uniform cylinders) have been a popular ready-to-eat snack food available in many supermarkets|carrot
Carrots are puréed and used as baby food, dehydrated to make chips, flakes, and powder, and thinly sliced and deep-fried, like potato chips.The sweetness of carrots allows the vegetable to be used in some fruit-like roles|carrot
Grated carrots are used in carrot cakes, as well as carrot puddings, an English dish thought to have originated in the early 19th century|carrot
Carrots can also be used alone or blended with fruits in jams and preserves|carrot
Carrot juice is also widely marketed, especially as a health drink, either stand-alone or blended with juices extracted from fruits and other vegetables.Highly excessive consumption over a period of time can result in carotenemia, a yellow-orange discoloration of the skin caused by a build up of carotenoids.|carrot
Raw carrots are 88% water, 9% carbohydrates, 0.9% protein, 2.8% dietary fiber, 1% ash and 0.2% fat|carrot
Carrot dietary fiber comprises mostly cellulose, with smaller proportions of hemicellulose, lignin and starch|carrot
Free sugars in carrot include sucrose, glucose, and fructose.The carrot gets its characteristic, bright orange colour from β-carotene, and lesser amounts of α-carotene, γ-carotene, lutein, and zeaxanthin|carrot
α- and β-carotenes are partly metabolized into vitamin A, providing more than 100% of the Daily Value (DV) per 100 g serving of carrots (right table)|carrot
Carrots are also a good source of vitamin K (13% DV) and vitamin B6 (11% DV), but otherwise have modest content of other essential nutrients (table).|carrot
The provitamin A beta-carotene from carrots does not actually help people to see in the dark unless they suffer from vitamin A deficiency|carrot
This myth was propaganda used by the Royal Air Force during the Second World War to explain why their pilots had improved success during night air battles, but was actually used to disguise advances in radar technology and the use of red lights on instrument panels.Nevertheless, the consumption of carrots was advocated in Britain at the time as part of a Dig for Victory campaign|carrot
A radio programme called The Kitchen Front encouraged people to grow, store and use carrots in various novel ways, including making carrot jam and Woolton pie, named after the Lord Woolton, the Minister for Food|carrot
The British public during WWII generally believed that eating carrots would help them see better at night and in 1942 there was a 100,000-ton surplus of carrots from the extra production.|carrot
Lettuce (Lactuca sativa) is an annual plant of the daisy family, Asteraceae|lettuce
It is most often grown as a leaf vegetable, but sometimes for its stem and seeds|lettuce
Lettuce is most often used for salads, although it is also seen in other kinds of food, such as soups, sandwiches and wraps; it can also be grilled|lettuce
One variety, the celtuce (asparagus lettuce), is grown for its stems, which are eaten either raw or cooked|lettuce
In addition to its main use as a leafy green, it has also gathered religious and medicinal significance over centuries of human consumption|lettuce
Europe and North America originally dominated the market for lettuce, but by the late 20th century the consumption of lettuce had spread throughout the world|lettuce
As of 2017, world production of lettuce and chicory was 27 million tonnes, 56% of which came from China.Lettuce was originally farmed by the ancient Egyptians, who transformed it from a plant whose seeds were used to obtain oil into an important food crop raised for its succulent leaves and oil-rich seeds|lettuce
Lettuce spread to the Greeks and Romans; the latter gave it the name lactuca, from which the English lettuce is derived|lettuce
By 50 AD, many types were described, and lettuce appeared often in medieval writings, including several herbals|lettuce
The 16th through 18th centuries saw the development of many varieties in Europe, and by the mid-18th century, cultivars were described that can still be found in gardens.|lettuce
Generally grown as a hardy annual, lettuce is easily cultivated, although it requires relatively low temperatures to prevent it from flowering quickly|lettuce
It can be plagued by numerous nutrient deficiencies, as well as insect and mammal pests, and fungal and bacterial diseases|lettuce
L|lettuce
sativa crosses easily within the species and with some other species within the genus Lactuca|lettuce
Although this trait can be a problem to home gardeners who attempt to save seeds, biologists have used it to broaden the gene pool of cultivated lettuce varieties.|lettuce
Lettuce is a rich source of vitamin K and vitamin A, and a moderate source of folate and iron|lettuce
Contaminated lettuce is often a source of bacterial, viral, and parasitic outbreaks in humans, including E|lettuce
coli and Salmonella.|lettuce
Lactuca sativa is a member of the Lactuca (lettuce) genus and the Asteraceae (sunflower or aster) family|lettuce
The species was first described in 1753 by Carl Linnaeus in the second volume of his Species Plantarum|lettuce
Synonyms for L|lettuce
sativa include Lactuca scariola var|lettuce
sativa, L|lettuce
scariola var|lettuce
integrata and L|lettuce
scariola var|lettuce
integrifolia|lettuce
L|lettuce
scariola is itself a synonym for L|lettuce
serriola, the common wild or prickly lettuce|lettuce
L|lettuce
sativa also has many identified taxonomic groups, subspecies and varieties, which delineate the various cultivar groups of domesticated lettuce|lettuce
Lettuce is closely related to several Lactuca species from southwest Asia; the closest relationship is to L|lettuce
"serriola, an aggressive weed common in temperate and subtropical zones in much of the world.The Romans referred to lettuce as lactuca (lac meaning ""dairy"" in Latin), an allusion to the white substance, latex, exuded by cut stems"|lettuce
"The name Lactuca has become the genus name, while sativa (meaning ""sown"" or ""cultivated"") was added to create the species name"|lettuce
The current word lettuce, originally from Middle English, came from the Old French letues or laitues, which derived from the Roman name|lettuce
The name romaine came from the variety of lettuce grown in the Roman papal gardens, while cos, another term for romaine lettuce, came from the earliest European seeds of the type from the Greek island of Kos, a center of lettuce farming in the Byzantine period.|lettuce
Lettuce's native range spreads from the Mediterranean to Siberia, although it has been transported to almost all areas of the world|lettuce
Plants generally have a height and spread of 15 to 30 cm (6 to 12 in)|lettuce
The leaves are colorful, mainly in the green and red color spectrums, with some variegated varieties|lettuce
There are also a few varieties with yellow, gold or blue-teal leaves.Lettuces have a wide range of shapes and textures, from the dense heads of the iceberg type to the notched, scalloped, frilly or ruffly leaves of leaf varieties|lettuce
Lettuce plants have a root system that includes a main taproot and smaller secondary roots|lettuce
Some varieties, especially those found in the United States and Western Europe, have long, narrow taproots and a small set of secondary roots|lettuce
Longer taproots and more extensive secondary systems are found in varieties from Asia.Depending on the variety and time of year, lettuce generally lives 65–130 days from planting to harvesting|lettuce
"Because lettuce that flowers (through the process known as ""bolting"") becomes bitter and unsaleable, plants grown for consumption are rarely allowed to grow to maturity"|lettuce
Lettuce flowers more quickly in hot temperatures, while freezing temperatures cause slower growth and sometimes damage to outer leaves.Once plants move past the edible stage, they develop flower stalks up to 1 m (3 ft 3 in) high with small yellow blossoms|lettuce
"Like other members of the tribe Cichorieae, lettuce inflorescences (also known as flower heads or capitula) are composed of multiple florets, each with a modified calyx called a pappus (which becomes the feathery ""parachute"" of the fruit), a corolla of five petals fused into a ligule or strap, and the reproductive parts"|lettuce
These include fused anthers that form a tube which surrounds a style and bipartite stigma|lettuce
As the anthers shed pollen, the style elongates to allow the stigmas, now coated with pollen, to emerge from the tube|lettuce
The ovaries form compressed, obovate (teardrop-shaped) dry fruits that do not open at maturity, measuring 3 to 4 mm long|lettuce
The fruits have 5–7 ribs on each side and are tipped by two rows of small white hairs|lettuce
The pappus remains at the top of each fruit as a dispersal structure|lettuce
Each fruit contains one seed, which can be white, yellow, gray or brown depending on the variety of lettuce.The domestication of lettuce over the centuries has resulted in several changes through selective breeding|lettuce
delayed bolting, larger seeds, larger leaves and heads, better taste and texture, a lower latex content, and different leaf shapes and colors|lettuce
Work in these areas continues through the present day|lettuce
Scientific research into the genetic modification of lettuce is ongoing, with over 85 field trials taking place between 1992 and 2005 in the European Union and the United States to test modifications allowing greater herbicide tolerance, greater resistance to insects and fungi and slower bolting patterns|lettuce
However, genetically modified lettuce is not currently used in commercial agriculture.|lettuce
Lettuce was first cultivated in ancient Egypt for the production of oil from its seeds|lettuce
The plant was probably selectively bred by the Egyptians into a plant grown for its edible leaves, with evidence of its cultivation appearing as early as 2680 BC|lettuce
Lettuce was considered a sacred plant of the reproduction god Min, and was carried during his festivals and placed near his images|lettuce
"The plant was thought to help the god ""perform the sexual act untiringly"""|lettuce
Its use in religious ceremonies resulted in the creation of many images in tombs and wall paintings|lettuce
The cultivated variety appears to have been about 75 cm (30 in) tall and resembled a large version of the modern romaine lettuce|lettuce
These upright lettuces were developed by the Egyptians and passed to the Greeks, who in turn shared them with the Romans|lettuce
Around 50 AD, Roman agriculturalist Columella described several lettuce varieties – some of which may have been ancestors of today's lettuces.Lettuce appears in many medieval writings, especially as a medicinal herb|lettuce
Hildegard of Bingen mentioned it in her writings on medicinal herbs between 1098 and 1179, and many early herbals also describe its uses|lettuce
In 1586, Joachim Camerarius provided descriptions of the three basic modern lettuces – head lettuce, loose-leaf lettuce, and romaine (or cos) lettuce|lettuce
Lettuce was first brought to the Americas from Europe by Christopher Columbus in the late 15th century|lettuce
Between the late 16th century and the early 18th century, many varieties were developed in Europe, particularly Holland|lettuce
Books published in the mid-18th and early 19th centuries describe several varieties found in gardens today.Due to its short lifespan after harvest, lettuce was originally sold relatively close to where it was grown|lettuce
The early 20th century saw the development of new packing, storage and shipping technologies that improved the lifespan and transportability of lettuce and resulted in a significant increase in availability|lettuce
During the 1950s, lettuce production was revolutionized with the development of vacuum cooling, which allowed field cooling and packing of lettuce, replacing the previously used method of ice-cooling in packing houses outside the fields.Lettuce is very easy to grow, and as such has been a significant source of sales for many seed companies|lettuce
Tracing the history of many varieties is complicated by the practice of many companies, particularly in the US, of changing a variety's name from year to year|lettuce
"This practice is conducted for several reasons, the most prominent being to boost sales by promoting a ""new"" variety, or to prevent customers from knowing that the variety had been developed by a competing seed company"|lettuce
Documentation from the late 19th century shows between 65 and 140 distinct varieties of lettuce, depending on the amount of variation allowed between types – a distinct difference from the 1,100 named lettuce varieties on the market at the time|lettuce
Names also often changed significantly from country to country|lettuce
Although most lettuce grown today is used as a vegetable, a minor amount is used in the production of tobacco-free cigarettes; however, domestic lettuce's wild relatives produce a leaf that visually more closely resembles tobacco.|lettuce
A hardy annual, some varieties of lettuce can be overwintered even in relatively cold climates under a layer of straw, and older, heirloom varieties are often grown in cold frames|lettuce
Lettuces meant for the cutting of individual leaves are generally planted straight into the garden in thick rows|lettuce
Heading varieties of lettuces are commonly started in flats, then transplanted to individual spots, usually 20 to 36 cm (7.9 to 14.2 in) apart, in the garden after developing several leaves|lettuce
Lettuce spaced farther apart receives more sunlight, which improves color and nutrient quantities in the leaves|lettuce
Pale to white lettuce, such as the centers in some iceberg lettuce, contain few nutrients.|lettuce
Lettuce grows best in full sun in loose, nitrogen-rich soils with a pH of between 6.0 and 6.8|lettuce
Heat generally prompts lettuce to bolt, with most varieties growing poorly above 24 °C (75 °F); cool temperatures prompt better performance, with 16 to 18 °C (61 to 64 °F) being preferred and as low as 7 °C (45 °F) being tolerated|lettuce
Plants in hot areas that are provided partial shade during the hottest part of the day will bolt more slowly|lettuce
Temperatures above 27 °C (81 °F) will generally result in poor or non-existent germination of lettuce seeds|lettuce
After harvest, lettuce lasts the longest when kept at 0 °C (32 °F) and 96 percent humidity|lettuce
Lettuce quickly degrades when stored with fruit such as apples, pears and bananas that release the ripening agent ethylene gas|lettuce
The high water content of lettuce (94.9 percent) creates problems when attempting to preserve the plant – it cannot be successfully frozen, canned or dried and must be eaten fresh|lettuce
In spite of its high water content, traditionally grown lettuce has a low water footprint, with 237 liters of water required for each kilogram of lettuce produced|lettuce
Hydroponic growing methods can reduce this water consumption by nearly two orders of magnitude.|lettuce
Lettuce varieties will cross with each other, making spacing of 1.5 to 6 m (60 to 240 in) between varieties necessary to prevent contamination when saving seeds|lettuce
Lettuce will also cross with Lactuca serriola (wild lettuce), with the resulting seeds often producing a plant with tough, bitter leaves|lettuce
Celtuce, a lettuce variety grown primarily in Asia for its stems, crosses easily with lettuces grown for their leaves|lettuce
This propensity for crossing, however, has led to breeding programs using closely related species in Lactuca, such as L|lettuce
serriola, L|lettuce
saligna, and L|lettuce
virosa, to broaden the available gene pool|lettuce
Starting in the 1990s, such programs began to include more distantly related species such as L|lettuce
tatarica.Seeds keep best when stored in cool conditions, and, unless stored cryogenically, remain viable the longest when stored at −20 °C (−4 °F); they are relatively short lived in storage|lettuce
At room temperature, lettuce seeds remain viable for only a few months|lettuce
However, when newly harvested lettuce seed is stored cryogenically, this life increases to a half-life of 500 years for vaporized nitrogen and 3,400 years for liquid nitrogen; this advantage is lost if seeds are not frozen promptly after harvesting.|lettuce
There are several types or cultivars of lettuce|lettuce
Three types – leaf, head and cos or romaine – are the most common|lettuce
There are seven main cultivar groups of lettuce, each including many varieties:|lettuce
Leaf – Also known as looseleaf, cutting or bunching lettuce, this type has loosely bunched leaves and is the most widely planted|lettuce
It is used mainly for salads.|lettuce
Romaine/Cos – Used mainly for salads and sandwiches, this type forms long, upright heads|lettuce
This is the most often used lettuce in Caesar salads.|lettuce
Iceberg/Crisphead – The most popular type in the United States, Iceberg lettuce is very heat-sensitive and was originally adapted for growth in the northern United States|lettuce
It ships well, but is low in flavor and nutritional content, being composed of even more water than other lettuce types.|lettuce
Summercrisp – Also called Batavian or French crisp, this lettuce is midway between the crisphead and leaf types|lettuce
These lettuces tend to be larger, bolt-resistant and well-flavored.|lettuce
Oilseed – This type is grown for its seeds, which are pressed to extract an oil mainly used for cooking|lettuce
It has few leaves, bolts quickly and produces seeds around 50 percent larger than other types of lettuce.|lettuce
Soil nutrient deficiencies can cause a variety of plant problems that range from malformed plants to a lack of head growth|lettuce
Many insects are attracted to lettuce, including cutworms, which cut seedlings off at the soil line; wireworms and nematodes, which cause yellow, stunted plants; tarnished plant bugs and aphids, which cause yellow, distorted leaves; leafhoppers, which cause stunted growth and pale leaves; thrips, which turn leaves gray-green or silver; leafminers, which create tunnels within the leaves; flea beetles, which cut small holes in leaves and caterpillars, slugs and snails, which cut large holes in leaves|lettuce
For example, the larvae of the ghost moth is a common pest of lettuce plants|lettuce
Mammals, including rabbits and groundhogs, also eat the plants|lettuce
Lettuce contains several defensive compounds, including sesquiterpene lactones, and other natural phenolics such as flavonol and glycosides, which help to protect it against pests|lettuce
Certain varieties contain more than others, and some selective breeding and genetic modification studies have focused on using this trait to identify and produce commercial varieties with increased pest resistance.Lettuce also suffers from several viral diseases, including big vein, which causes yellow, distorted leaves, and mosaic virus, which is spread by aphids and causes stunted plant growth and deformed leaves|lettuce
Aster yellows are a disease-causing bacteria carried by leafhoppers, which causes deformed leaves|lettuce
Fungal diseases include powdery mildew and downy mildew, which cause leaves to mold and die and bottom rot, lettuce drop and gray mold, which cause entire plants to rot and collapse|lettuce
Bacterial diseases include Botrytis cinerea, for which UV-C treatments may be used|lettuce
Vàsquez et al 2017 find that phenylalanine ammonia-lyase activity, phenolic production, and B|lettuce
cinerea resistance are increased by UV-C|lettuce
Crowding lettuce tends to attract pests and diseases|lettuce
Weeds can also be an issue, as cultivated lettuce is generally not competitive with them, especially when directly seeded into the ground|lettuce
Transplanted lettuce (started in flats and later moved to growing beds) is generally more competitive initially, but can still be crowded later in the season, causing misshapen lettuce and lower yields|lettuce
Weeds also act as homes for insects and disease and can make harvesting more difficult|lettuce
Herbicides are often used to control weeds in commercial production|lettuce
However, this has led to the development of herbicide-resistant weeds in lettuce cultivation.|lettuce
Lettuce is the only member of the genus Lactuca to be grown commercially|lettuce
Although China is the top world producer of lettuce, the majority of the crop is consumed domestically|lettuce
Spain is the world's largest exporter of lettuce, with the US ranking second.Western Europe and North America were the original major markets for large-scale lettuce production|lettuce
By the late 1900s, Asia, South America, Australia and Africa became more substantial markets|lettuce
Different locations tended to prefer different types of lettuce, with butterhead prevailing in northern Europe and Great Britain, romaine in the Mediterranean and stem lettuce in China and Egypt|lettuce
By the late 20th century, the preferred types began to change, with crisphead, especially iceberg, lettuce becoming the dominant type in northern Europe and Great Britain and more popular in western Europe|lettuce
In the US, no one type predominated until the early 20th century, when crisphead lettuces began gaining popularity|lettuce
After the 1940s, with the development of iceberg lettuce, 95 percent of the lettuce grown and consumed in the US was crisphead lettuce|lettuce
By the end of the century, other types began to regain popularity and eventually made up over 30 percent of production|lettuce
Stem lettuce was first developed in China, where it remains primarily cultivated.In the early 21st century, bagged salad products increased in the lettuce market, especially in the US where innovative packaging and shipping methods prolonged freshness.In the United States in 2013, California (71%) and Arizona (29%) produced nearly all of the country's fresh head and leaf lettuce, with head lettuce yielding $9400 of value per acre and leaf lettuce $8000 per acre.|lettuce
As described around 50 AD, lettuce leaves were often cooked and served by the Romans with an oil-and-vinegar dressing; however, smaller leaves were sometimes eaten raw|lettuce
During the 81–96 AD reign of Domitian, the tradition of serving a lettuce salad before a meal began|lettuce
Post-Roman Europe continued the tradition of poaching lettuce, mainly with large romaine types, as well as the method of pouring a hot oil and vinegar mixture over the leaves.Today, the majority of lettuce is grown for its leaves, although one type is grown for its stem and one for its seeds, which are made into an oil|lettuce
Most lettuce is used in salads, either alone or with other greens, vegetables, meats and cheeses|lettuce
Romaine lettuce is often used for Caesar salads|lettuce
"Lettuce leaves can also be found in soups, sandwiches and wraps, while the stems are eaten both raw and cooked.The consumption of lettuce in China developed differently from in Western countries, due to health risks and cultural aversion to eating raw leaves; Chinese ""salads"" are composed of cooked vegetables and are served hot or cold"|lettuce
Lettuce is also used in a larger variety of dishes than in Western countries, contributing to a range of dishes including bean curd and meat dishes, soups and stir-frys plain or with other vegetables|lettuce
Stem lettuce, widely consumed in China, is eaten either raw or cooked, the latter primarily in soups and stir-frys|lettuce
Lettuce is also used as a primary ingredient in the preparation of lettuce soup.|lettuce
Depending on the variety, lettuce is an excellent source (20% of the Daily Value, DV, or higher) of vitamin K (97% DV) and vitamin A (21% DV) (table), with higher concentrations of the provitamin A compound, beta-carotene, found in darker green lettuces, such as romaine|lettuce
With the exception of the iceberg variety, lettuce is also a good source (10–19% DV) of folate and iron (table).|lettuce
Food-borne pathogens that can survive on lettuce include Listeria monocytogenes, the causative agent of listeriosis, which multiplies in storage|lettuce
However, despite high levels of bacteria being found on ready-to-eat lettuce products, a 2008 study found no incidences of food-borne illness related to listeriosis, possibly due to the product's short shelf life, indigenous microflora competing with the Listeria bacteria or inhibition of bacteria to cause listeriosis.Other bacteria found on lettuce include Aeromonas species, which have not been linked to any outbreaks; Campylobacter species, which cause campylobacteriosis; and Yersinia intermedia and Yersinia kristensenii (species of Yersinia), which have been found mainly in lettuce|lettuce
Lettuce has been linked to numerous outbreaks of the bacteria E|lettuce
coli O157:H7 and Shigella; the plants were most likely contaminated through contact with animal feces|lettuce
A 2007 study determined that the vacuum cooling method, especially prevalent in the California lettuce industry, increased the uptake and survival rates of E|lettuce
coli O157:H7|lettuce
Salmonella bacteria, including the uncommon Salmonella braenderup type, have also caused outbreaks traced to contaminated lettuce|lettuce
Viruses, including hepatitis A, calicivirus and a Norwalk-like strain, have been found in lettuce|lettuce
The vegetable has also been linked to outbreaks of parasitic infestations, including Giardia lamblia.|lettuce
In addition to its usual purpose as an edible leafy vegetable, lettuce has had a number of uses in ancient (and even some more modern) folk medicine and religious symbolism|lettuce
For example, ancient Egyptians thought lettuce to be a symbol of sexual prowess and a promoter of love and childbearing in women|lettuce
The Romans likewise claimed that it increased sexual potency|lettuce
In contrast, the ancient Greeks connected the plant with male impotency, and served it during funerals (probably due to its role in the myth of Adonis' death), and British women in the 19th century believed it would cause infertility and sterility.|lettuce
"Lettuce has mild narcotic properties; it was called ""sleepwort"" by the Anglo-Saxons because of this attribute, although the cultivated L"|lettuce
sativa has lower levels of the narcotic than its wild cousins|lettuce
"This narcotic effect is a property of two sesquiterpene lactones (lactucin and lactucopicrin) which are found in the white liquid (latex) in the stems of lettuce, called lactucarium or ""lettuce opium"""|lettuce
"Although the standard definition of lactucarium requires its production from Lactuca virosa or ""wild lettuce"", it was recognized that smaller quantities of lactucarium could be produced in a similar way from Lactuca sativa and Lactuca canadensis var"|lettuce
elongata, and that lettuce-opium obtained from Lactuca serriola or Lactuca quercina was of superior quality.Romaine lettuce is one of the symbolic items on the Jewish Passover Seder plate as a bitter herb.Some American settlers claimed that smallpox could be prevented through the ingestion of lettuce, and an Iranian belief suggested consumption of the seeds when afflicted with typhoid|lettuce
Folk medicine has also claimed it as a treatment for pain, rheumatism, tension and nervousness, coughs and insanity; scientific evidence of these benefits in humans has not been found|lettuce
The religious ties of lettuce continue into the present day among the Yazidi people of northern Iraq, who have a religious prohibition against eating the plant.|lettuce

Cauliflower is one of several vegetables in the species Brassica oleracea in the genus Brassica, which is in the Brassicaceae (or Mustard) family|cauliflower
It is an annual plant that reproduces by seed|cauliflower
"Typically, only the head is eaten – the edible white flesh sometimes called ""curd"" (with a similar appearance to cheese curd)"|cauliflower
The cauliflower head is composed of a white inflorescence meristem|cauliflower
Cauliflower heads resemble those in broccoli, which differs in having flower buds as the edible portion|cauliflower
"Brassica oleracea also includes broccoli, Brussels sprouts, cabbage, collard greens, and kale, collectively called ""cole"" crops, though they are of different cultivar groups."|cauliflower
Pliny the Elder  included cyma among cultivated plants he described in Natural History|cauliflower
"""Ex omnibus brassicae generibus suavissima est cyma,"" (""Of all the varieties of cabbage the most pleasant-tasted is cyma"")"|cauliflower
Pliny's description likely refers to the flowering heads of an earlier cultivated variety of Brassica oleracea.In the Middle Ages, early forms of cauliflower were associated with the island of Cyprus, with the 12th- and 13th-century Arab botanists Ibn al-'Awwam and Ibn al-Baitar, claiming its origin to be Cyprus|cauliflower
This association continued into Western Europe, where cauliflowers were sometimes known as Cyprus colewort, and there was extensive trade in western Europe in cauliflower seeds from Cyprus, under the French Lusignan rulers of the island, until well into the 16th century.François Pierre La Varenne employed chouxfleurs in Le cuisinier françois|cauliflower
"They were introduced to France from Genoa in the 16th century, and are featured in Olivier de Serres' Théâtre de l'agriculture (1600), as cauli-fiori ""as the Italians call it, which are still rather rare in France; they hold an honorable place in the garden because of their delicacy"", but they did not commonly appear on grand tables until the time of Louis XIV"|cauliflower
It was introduced to India in 1822 by the British.|cauliflower
"The word ""cauliflower"" derives from the Italian cavolfiore, meaning ""cabbage flower"""|cauliflower
The ultimate origin of the name is from the Latin words caulis (cabbage) and flōs (flower).|cauliflower
Because weather is a limiting factor for producing cauliflower, the plant grows best in moderate daytime temperatures 21–29 °C (70–85 °F), with plentiful sun, and moist soil conditions high in organic matter and sandy soils|cauliflower
The earliest maturity possible for cauliflower is 7 to 12 weeks from transplanting|cauliflower
In the northern hemisphere, fall season plantings in July may enable harvesting before autumn frost.Long periods of sun exposure in hot summer weather may cause cauliflower heads to discolor with a red-purple hue.|cauliflower
Transplantable cauliflowers can be produced in containers as flats, hotbeds, or in the field|cauliflower
In soil that is loose, well-drained and fertile, field seedlings are shallow-planted 1 cm (1⁄2 in) and thinned by ample space – about 12 plants per 30 cm (1 ft)|cauliflower
Ideal growing temperatures are about 18 °C (65 °F) when seedlings are 25 to 35 days old|cauliflower
Applications of fertilizer to developing seedlings begin when leaves appear, usually with a starter solution weekly.|cauliflower
Transplanting to the field normally begins late spring and may continue until mid-summer|cauliflower
Row spacing is about 38–46 cm (15–18 in)|cauliflower
The most important disorders affecting cauliflower quality are a hollow stem, stunted head growth or buttoning, ricing, browning and leaf-tip burn|cauliflower
Among major pests affecting cauliflower are aphids, root maggots, cutworms, moths, and flea beetles|cauliflower
The plant is susceptible to black rot, black leg, club root, black leaf spot, and downy mildew.|cauliflower
When cauliflower is mature, heads appear as clear white, compact, and 15–20 cm (6–8 in) in diameter, and should be cooled shortly after harvest|cauliflower
Forced air cooling to remove heat from the field during hot weather may be needed for optimal preservation|cauliflower
Short-term storage is possible using cool, high-humidity storage conditions.|cauliflower
Italian|cauliflower
This specimen is diverse in appearance, biennial and annual in type|cauliflower
This group also includes white, Romanesco, various brown, green, purple, and yellow cultivars|cauliflower
This type is the ancestral form from which the others were derived.|cauliflower
Northern European annuals|cauliflower
Used in Europe and North America for summer and fall harvest, it was developed in Germany in the 18th century and includes the old cultivars Erfurt and Snowball.|cauliflower
Northwest European biennial|cauliflower
Used in Europe for winter and early spring harvest, this was developed in France in the 19th century and includes the old cultivars Angers and Roscoff.|cauliflower
Asian|cauliflower
A tropical cauliflower used in China and India, it was developed in India during the 19th century from the now-abandoned Cornish type and includes old varieties Early Benaras and Early Patna.|cauliflower
There are hundreds of historic and current commercial varieties used around the world|cauliflower
A comprehensive list of about 80 North American varieties is maintained at North Carolina State University.|cauliflower
Orange cauliflower contains beta-carotene as the orange pigment, a provitamin A compound|cauliflower
This orange trait originated from a natural mutant found in a cauliflower field in Canada|cauliflower
Cultivars include 'Cheddar' and 'Orange Bouquet'.|cauliflower
Green cauliflower in the B|cauliflower
oleracea Botrytis Group is sometimes called broccoflower|cauliflower
It is available in the normal curd (head) shape and with a fractal spiral curd called Romanesco broccoli|cauliflower
Both have been commercially available in the U.S|cauliflower
and Europe since the early 1990s|cauliflower
Green-headed varieties include 'Alverda', 'Green Goddess' and 'Vorda'|cauliflower
Romanesco varieties include 'Minaret' and 'Veronica'.|cauliflower
The purple color in this cauliflower is caused by the presence of anthocyanins, water-soluble pigments that are found in many other plants and plant-based products, such as red cabbage and red wine|cauliflower
Varieties include 'Graffiti' and 'Purple Cape'.|cauliflower
In 2016, global production of cauliflowers (combined for production reports with broccoli) was 25.2 million tonnes, led by China and India which, combined, had 73% of the world total|cauliflower
Secondary producers, having 0.4–1.3 million tonnes annually, were the United States, Spain, Mexico and Italy.|cauliflower
Raw cauliflower is 92% water, 5% carbohydrates, 2% protein, and contains negligible fat (table)|cauliflower
A 100-gram (3+1⁄2-ounce) reference amount of raw cauliflower provides 104 kilojoules (25 kilocalories) of food energy, and has a high content (20% or more of the Daily Value, DV) of vitamin C (58% DV) and moderate levels of several B vitamins and vitamin K (13–15% DV; table)|cauliflower
Contents of dietary minerals are low (7% DV or less).|cauliflower
Cauliflower contains several non-nutrient phytochemicals common in the cabbage family that are under preliminary research for their potential properties, including isothiocyanates and glucosinolates|cauliflower
Boiling reduces the levels of cauliflower glucosinolates, while other cooking methods, such as steaming, microwaving, and stir frying, have no significant effect on glucosinolate levels.|cauliflower
Cauliflower heads can be roasted, grilled, boiled, fried, steamed, pickled, or eaten raw|cauliflower
"When cooking, the outer leaves and thick stalks are typically removed, leaving only the florets (the edible ""curd"" or ""head"")"|cauliflower
The leaves are also edible but are often discarded.Cauliflower is a low-calorie, gluten-free alternative to rice and flour|cauliflower
Between 2012 and 2016, cauliflower production in the United States increased 63%, and cauliflower-based product sales increased 71% between 2017 and 2018|cauliflower
Cauliflower rice is made by pulsing cauliflower florets followed by cooking the result in oil|cauliflower
Cauliflower pizza crust is made from cauliflower flour and is popular in pizza restaurants|cauliflower
Mashed cauliflower is a low-carbohydrate alternative to mashed potatoes.|cauliflower
"One of the fractal properties of cauliflower is that every branch, or ""module"", is similar to the entire cauliflower"|cauliflower
"Another quality, also present in other plant species, is that the angle between ""modules,"" as they become more distant from the center, is 360 degrees divided by the golden ratio."|cauliflower

The tomato is the edible berry of the plant Solanum lycopersicum, commonly known as a tomato plant|tomato
The species originated in western South America and Central America|tomato
The Nahuatl word tomatl gave rise to the Spanish word tomate, from which the English word tomato derived|tomato
Its domestication and use as a cultivated food may have originated with the indigenous peoples of Mexico|tomato
The Aztecs used tomatoes in their cooking at the time of the Spanish conquest of the Aztec Empire, and after the Spanish encountered the tomato for the first time after their contact with the Aztecs, they brought the plant to Europe, in a widespread transfer of plants known as the columbian exchange|tomato
From there, the tomato was introduced to other parts of the European-colonized world during the 16th century.Tomatoes are a significant source of umami flavor.|tomato
The tomato is consumed in diverse ways, raw or cooked, in many dishes, sauces, salads, and drinks|tomato
While tomatoes are fruits—botanically classified as berries—they are commonly used as a vegetable ingredient or side dish.Numerous varieties of the tomato plant are widely grown in temperate climates across the world, with greenhouses allowing for the production of tomatoes throughout all seasons of the year|tomato
Tomato plants typically grow to 1–3 meters (3–10 ft) in height|tomato
They are vines that have a weak stem that sprawls and typically needs support|tomato
Indeterminate tomato plants are perennials in their native habitat, but are cultivated as annuals|tomato
(Determinate, or bush, plants are annuals that stop growing at a certain height and produce a crop all at once.) The size of the tomato varies according to the cultivar, with a range of 1–10 cm (1⁄2–4 in) in width.|tomato
The word tomato comes from the Spanish tomate, which in turn comes from the Nahuatl word tomatl [ˈtomat͡ɬ] pronunciation , meaning 'swelling fruit'; also  'fat water' or 'fat thing'|tomato
The native Mexican tomatillo is tomate|tomato
When Aztecs started to cultivate the fruit to be larger, sweeter and red, they called the new variety xitomatl (or jitomates) (pronounced [ʃiːˈtomatɬ]), ('plump with navel' or 'fat water with navel')|tomato
The scientific species name lycopersicum (from the 1753 book, Species Plantarum) is of Greek origin (λύκοπερσικων; lykopersikon), meaning 'wolf peach'.|tomato
The usual pronunciations of tomato are  (usual in American English) and  (usual in British English)|tomato
"The word's dual pronunciations were immortalized in Ira and George Gershwin's 1937 song ""Let's Call the Whole Thing Off"" (""You like  and I like  / You like  and I like "") and have become a symbol for nitpicking pronunciation disputes"|tomato
In this capacity, it has even become an American and British slang term|tomato
"saying """" when presented with two choices can mean ""What's the difference?"" or ""It's all the same to me""."|tomato
Tomato plants are vines, initially decumbent, typically growing 180 cm (6 ft) or more above the ground if supported, although erect bush varieties have been bred, generally 100 cm (3 ft 3 in) tall or shorter|tomato
"Indeterminate types are ""tender"" perennials, dying annually in temperate climates (they are originally native to tropical highlands), although they can live up to three years in a greenhouse in some cases"|tomato
Determinate types are annual in all climates.Tomato plants are dicots, and grow as a series of branching stems, with a terminal bud at the tip that does the actual growing|tomato
When that tip eventually stops growing, whether because of pruning or flowering, lateral buds take over and grow into other, fully functional, vines.Tomato vines are typically pubescent, meaning covered with fine short hairs|tomato
These hairs facilitate the vining process, turning into roots wherever the plant is in contact with the ground and moisture, especially if the vine's connection to its original root has been damaged or severed.Most tomato plants have compound leaves, and are called regular leaf (RL) plants, but some cultivars have simple leaves known as potato leaf (PL) style because of their resemblance to that particular relative|tomato
Of RL plants, there are variations, such as rugose leaves, which are deeply grooved, and variegated, angora leaves, which have additional colors where a genetic mutation causes chlorophyll to be excluded from some portions of the leaves.The leaves are 10–25 cm (4–10 in) long, odd pinnate, with five to nine leaflets on petioles, each leaflet up to 8 cm (3 in) long, with a serrated margin; both the stem and leaves are densely glandular-hairy.Their flowers, appearing on the apical meristem, have the anthers fused along the edges, forming a column surrounding the pistil's style|tomato
Flowers in domestic cultivars can be self-fertilizing|tomato
The flowers are 1–2 cm (1⁄2–3⁄4 in) across, yellow, with five pointed lobes on the corolla; they are borne in a cyme of three to 12 together.Although in culinary terms, tomato is regarded as a vegetable, its fruit is classified botanically as a berry|tomato
As a true fruit, it develops from the ovary of the plant after fertilization, its flesh comprising the pericarp walls|tomato
The fruit contains hollow spaces full of seeds and moisture, called locular cavities|tomato
These vary, among cultivated species, according to type|tomato
Some smaller varieties have two cavities, globe-shaped varieties typically have three to five, beefsteak tomatoes have a great number of smaller cavities, while paste tomatoes have very few, very small cavities.For propagation, the seeds need to come from a mature fruit, and be dried or fermented before germination.|tomato
In 1753, Linnaeus placed the tomato in the genus Solanum (alongside the potato) as Solanum lycopersicum|tomato
In 1768, Philip Miller moved it to its own genus, naming it Lycopersicon esculentum|tomato
This name came into wide use, but was technically in breach of the plant naming rules because Linnaeus's species name lycopersicum still had priority|tomato
Although the name Lycopersicum lycopersicum was suggested by Karsten (1888), this is not used because it violates the International Code of Nomenclature barring the use of tautonyms in botanical nomenclature|tomato
The corrected name Lycopersicon lycopersicum (Nicolson 1974) was technically valid, since Miller's genus name and Linnaeus's species name differ in exact spelling, but since Lycopersicon esculentum has become so well known, it was officially listed as a nomen conservandum in 1983, and would be the correct name for the tomato in classifications which do not place the tomato in the genus Solanum.|tomato
Genetic evidence has now shown that Linnaeus was correct to put the tomato in the genus Solanum, making Solanum lycopersicum the correct name|tomato
Both names, however, will probably be found in the literature for some time|tomato
Two of the major reasons for considering the genera separate are the leaf structure (tomato leaves are markedly different from any other Solanum), and the biochemistry (many of the alkaloids common to other Solanum species are conspicuously absent in the tomato)|tomato
On the other hand, hybrids of tomato and diploid potato can be created in the lab by somatic fusion, and are partially fertile, providing evidence of the close relationship between these species.|tomato
Tomatoes that have been modified using genetic engineering have been developed, and although none are commercially available now, they have been in the past|tomato
The first commercially available genetically modified food was a variety of tomato named the Flavr Savr, which was engineered to have a longer shelf life|tomato
Scientists are continuing to develop tomatoes with new traits not found in natural crops, such as increased resistance to pests or environmental stresses|tomato
Other projects aim to enrich tomatoes with substances that may offer health benefits or provide better nutrition.|tomato
An international consortium of researchers from 10 countries, among them researchers from the Boyce Thompson Institute for Plant Research, began sequencing the tomato genome in 2004, and is creating a database of genomic sequences and information on the tomato and related plants|tomato
A prerelease version of the genome was made available in December 2009|tomato
The genomes of its mitochondria and chloroplasts are also being sequenced as part of the project|tomato
The complete genome for the cultivar Heinz 1706 was published on 31 May 2012 in Nature|tomato
Since many other fruits, like strawberries, apples, melons, and bananas share the same characteristics and genes, researchers stated the published genome could help to improve food quality, food security and reduce costs of all of these fruits.|tomato
The Tomato Genetic Resource Center, Germplasm Resources Information Network, AVRDC, and numerous seed banks around the world store seed representing genetic variations of value to modern agriculture|tomato
These seed stocks are available for legitimate breeding and research efforts|tomato
While individual breeding efforts can produce useful results, the bulk of tomato breeding work is at universities and major agriculture-related corporations|tomato
These efforts have resulted in significant regionally adapted breeding lines and hybrids, such as the Mountain series from North Carolina|tomato
Corporations including Heinz, Monsanto, BHNSeed, and Bejoseed have breeding programs that attempt to improve production, size, shape, color, flavor, disease tolerance, pest tolerance, nutritional value, and numerous other traits.|tomato
Botanically, a tomato is a fruit—a berry, consisting of the ovary, together with its seeds, of a flowering plant|tomato
"However, the tomato is considered a ""culinary vegetable"" because it has a much lower sugar content than culinary fruits; because it is more savoury (umami) than sweet, it is typically served as part of a salad or main course of a meal, rather than as a dessert"|tomato
Tomatoes are not the only food source with this ambiguity; bell peppers, cucumbers, green beans, eggplants, avocados, and squashes of all kinds (such as zucchini and pumpkins) are all botanically fruit, yet cooked as vegetables|tomato
This has led to legal dispute in the United States|tomato
In 1887, U.S|tomato
tariff laws that imposed a duty on vegetables, but not on fruit, caused the tomato's status to become a matter of legal importance|tomato
In Nix v|tomato
Hedden, the U.S|tomato
Supreme Court settled the tariff controversy on May 10, 1893, by declaring that the tomato is a vegetable, based on the popular definition that classifies vegetables by use—they are generally served with dinner and not dessert|tomato
The holding of this case applies only to the interpretation of the Tariff of 1883, and the court did not purport to reclassify the tomato for botanical or other purposes.|tomato
The wild ancestor of the tomato is native to western South America|tomato
These wild versions were the size of peas|tomato
Aztecs and other peoples in Mesoamerica were the first to have domesticated the fruit and used in their cooking|tomato
The Spanish first introduced tomatoes to Europe, where they became used in Spanish food|tomato
In France, Italy and northern Europe, the tomato was initially grown as an ornamental plant|tomato
It was regarded with suspicion as a food because botanists recognized it as a nightshade, a relative of the poisonous belladonna|tomato
This was exacerbated by the interaction of the tomato's acidic juice with pewter plates|tomato
The leaves and immature fruit contains tomatine, which in large quantities would be toxic|tomato
However, the ripe fruit contains no tomatine.|tomato
The exact date of domestication is unknown; by 500 BC, it was already being cultivated in southern Mexico and probably other areas.|tomato
13  The Pueblo people are thought to have believed that those who witnessed the ingestion of tomato seeds were blessed with powers of divination|tomato
The large, lumpy variety of tomato, a mutation from a smoother, smaller fruit, originated in Mesoamerica, and may be the direct ancestor of some modern cultivated tomatoes.|tomato
15 The Aztecs raised several varieties of tomato, with red tomatoes called xictomatl and green tomatoes called tomatl (Tomatillo)|tomato
Bernardino de Sahagún reported seeing a great variety of tomatoes in the Aztec market at Tenochtitlán (Mexico City)|tomato
“|tomato
large tomatoes, small tomatoes, leaf tomatoes, sweet tomatoes, large serpent tomatoes, nipple-shaped tomatoes,” and tomatoes of all colors from the brightest red to the deepest yellow|tomato
Bernardino de Sahagún mentioned Aztecs cooking various sauces, some with and without tomatoes of different sizes, serving them in city markets|tomato
"""foods sauces, hot sauces; fried [food], olla-cooked [food], juices, sauces of juices, shredded [food] with chile, with squash seeds [most likely Cucurbita pepo], with tomatoes, with smoked chile, with hot chile, with yellow chile, with mild red chile sauce, yellow chile sauce, hot chile sauce, with ""bird excrement"" sauce, sauce of smoked chile, heated [sauces], bean sauce; [he sells] toasted beans, cooked beans, mushroom sauce, sauce of small squash, sauce of large tomatoes, sauce of ordinary tomatoes, sauce of various kinds of sour herbs, avocado sauce."""|tomato
Spanish conquistador Hernán Cortés may have been the first to transfer a small yellow tomato to Europe after he captured the Aztec city of Tenochtitlan, now Mexico City, in 1521|tomato
The earliest discussion of the tomato in European literature appeared in a herbal written in 1544 by Pietro Andrea Mattioli, an Italian physician and botanist, who suggested that a new type of eggplant had been brought to Italy that was blood red or golden color when mature and could be divided into segments and eaten like an eggplant—that is, cooked and seasoned with salt, black pepper, and oil|tomato
"It was not until ten years later that tomatoes were named in print by Mattioli as pomi d'oro, or ""golden apples""."|tomato
13 After the Spanish colonization of the Americas, the Spanish distributed the tomato throughout their colonies in the Caribbean|tomato
They also took it to the Philippines, from where it spread to southeast Asia and then the entire Asian continent|tomato
The Spanish also brought the tomato to Europe|tomato
It grew easily in Mediterranean climates, and cultivation began in the 1540s|tomato
It was probably eaten shortly after it was introduced, and was certainly being used as food by the early 17th century in Spain.|tomato
The tomato was introduced to China, likely via the Philippines or Macau, in the 1500s|tomato
It was given the name fānqié (barbarian eggplant), as the Chinese named many foodstuffs introduced from abroad, but referring specifically to early introductions.|tomato
"The recorded history of tomatoes in Italy dates back to at least 31 October 1548, when the house steward of Cosimo de' Medici, the grand duke of Tuscany, wrote to the Medici private secretary informing him that the basket of tomatoes sent from the grand duke's Florentine estate at Torre del Gallo ""had arrived safely"""|tomato
Tomatoes were grown mainly as ornamentals early on after their arrival in Italy|tomato
"For example, the Florentine aristocrat Giovanvettorio Soderini wrote how they ""were to be sought only for their beauty"", and were grown only in gardens or flower beds"|tomato
The tomato's ability to mutate and create new and different varieties helped contribute to its success and spread throughout Italy|tomato
However, even in areas where the climate supported growing tomatoes, their habit of growing to the ground suggested low status|tomato
They were not adopted as a staple of the peasant population because they were not as filling as other fruits already available|tomato
Additionally, both toxic and inedible varieties discouraged many people from attempting to consume or prepare any other varieties|tomato
In certain areas of Italy, such as Florence, the fruit was used solely as a tabletop decoration, until it was incorporated into the local cuisine in the late 17th or early 18th century|tomato
The earliest discovered cookbook with tomato recipes was published in Naples in 1692, though the author had apparently obtained these recipes from Spanish sources.|tomato
17 Unique varieties were developed over the next several hundred years for uses such as dried tomatoes, sauce tomatoes, pizza tomatoes, and tomatoes for long-term storage|tomato
These varieties are usually known for their place of origin as much as by a variety name|tomato
"For example, Pomodorino del Piennolo del Vesuvio is the ""hanging tomato of Vesuvius"", or the well known and highly-prized San Marzano plum tomato grown in that region."|tomato
Tomatoes were not grown in England until the 1590s.|tomato
17  One of the earliest cultivators was John Gerard, a barber-surgeon.|tomato
17  Gerard's Herbal, published in 1597, and largely plagiarized from continental sources,|tomato
17  is also one of the earliest discussions of the tomato in England|tomato
Gerard knew the tomato was eaten in Spain and Italy.|tomato
17  Nonetheless, he believed it was poisonous|tomato
17  (in fact, the plant and raw fruit do have low levels of tomatine, but are not generally dangerous; see below)|tomato
Gerard's views were influential, and the tomato was considered unfit for eating (though not necessarily poisonous) for many years in Britain and its North American colonies.|tomato
"17 However, by the mid-18th century, tomatoes were widely eaten in Britain, and before the end of that century, the Encyclopædia Britannica stated the tomato was ""in daily use"" in soups, broths, and as a garnish"|tomato
"They were not part of the average person's diet, and though by 1820 they were described as ""to be seen in great abundance in all our vegetable markets"" and to be ""used by all our best cooks"", reference was made to their cultivation in gardens still ""for the singularity of their appearance"", while their use in cooking was associated with exotic Italian or Jewish cuisine."|tomato
It was grown from the 18th century onwards for the British|tomato
"Even today, in Bengal, the alternative name is ""Biliti Begun"" (Bengali"|tomato
"বিলিতি বেগুন), meaning ""Foreign Eggplant"""|tomato
The tomato was introduced to cultivation in the Middle East by John Barker, British consul in Aleppo circa 1799 to 1825|tomato
Nineteenth century descriptions of its consumption are uniformly as an ingredient in a cooked dish|tomato
"In 1881, it is described as only eaten in the region ""within the last forty years"""|tomato
Today, the tomato is a critical and ubiquitous part of Middle Eastern cuisine, served fresh in salads (e.g., Arab salad, Israeli salad, Shirazi salad and Turkish salad), grilled with kebabs and other dishes, made into sauces, and so on.|tomato
The earliest reference to tomatoes being grown in British North America is from 1710, when herbalist William Salmon reported seeing them in what is today South Carolina.|tomato
25  They may have been introduced from the Caribbean|tomato
By the mid-18th century, they were cultivated on some Carolina plantations, and probably in other parts of the Southeast as well|tomato
Possibly, some people continued to think tomatoes were poisonous at this time; and in general, they were grown more as ornamental plants than as food|tomato
Thomas Jefferson, who ate tomatoes in Paris, sent some seeds back to America.|tomato
28  Some early American advocates of the culinary use of the tomato included Michele Felice Cornè and Robert Gibbon Johnson.Early tomato breeders included Henry Tilden in Iowa and a Dr|tomato
Hand in Baltimore.Alexander W|tomato
Livingston receives much credit for developing numerous varieties of tomato for both home and commercial gardeners|tomato
The U.S|tomato
"Department of Agriculture's 1937 yearbook declared that ""half of the major varieties were a result of the abilities of the Livingstons to evaluate and perpetuate superior material in the tomato."" Livingston's first breed of tomato, the Paragon, was introduced in 1870, the beginning of a great tomato culture enterprise in the county"|tomato
In 1875, he introduced the Acme, which was said to be involved in the parentage of most of the tomatoes introduced by him and his competitors for the next twenty-five years.When Livingston began his attempts to develop the tomato as a commercial crop, his aim had been to grow tomatoes smooth in contour, uniform in size, and sweet in flavor|tomato
He eventually developed over seventeen different varieties of the tomato plant|tomato
Today, the crop is grown in every state in the Union.Because of the long growing season needed for this heat-loving crop, several states in the US Sun Belt became major tomato-producers, particularly Florida and California|tomato
In California, tomatoes are grown under irrigation for both the fresh fruit market and for canning and processing|tomato
The University of California, Davis (UC Davis) became a major center for research on the tomato|tomato
The C.M|tomato
Rick Tomato Genetics Resource Center at UC Davis is a gene bank of wild relatives, monogenic mutants and miscellaneous genetic stocks of tomato|tomato
The center is named for the late Dr|tomato
Charles M|tomato
Rick, a pioneer in tomato genetics research|tomato
Research on processing tomatoes is also conducted by the California Tomato Research Institute in Escalon, California.In California, growers have used a method of cultivation called dry-farming, especially with Early Girl tomatoes|tomato
This technique encourages the plant to send roots deep to find existing moisture in soil that retains moisture, such as clayey soil.|tomato
The poor taste and lack of sugar in modern garden and commercial tomato varieties resulted from breeding tomatoes to ripen uniformly red|tomato
"This change occurred after discovery of a mutant ""u"" phenotype in the mid 20th century that ripened ""u""niformly"|tomato
This was widely cross-bred to produce red fruit without the typical green ring around the stem on uncross-bred varieties|tomato
Prior to general introduction of this trait, most tomatoes produced more sugar during ripening, and were sweeter and more flavorful.Evidence has been found that 10–20% of the total carbon fixed in the fruit can be produced by photosynthesis in the developing fruit of the normal U phenotype|tomato
The u genetic mutation encodes a factor that produces defective chloroplasts with lower density in developing fruit, resulting in a lighter green colour of unripe fruit, and repression of sugars accumulation in the resulting ripe fruit by 10–15%|tomato
Perhaps more important than their role in photosynthesis, the fruit chloroplasts are remodelled during ripening into chlorophyll-free chromoplasts that synthesize and accumulate the carotenoids lycopene, β-carotene, and other metabolites that are sensory and nutritional assets of the ripe fruit|tomato
The potent chloroplasts in the dark-green shoulders of the U phenotype are beneficial here, but have the disadvantage of leaving green shoulders near the stems of the ripe fruit, and even cracked yellow shoulders, apparently because of oxidative stress due to overload of the photosynthetic chain in direct sunlight at high temperatures|tomato
Hence genetic design of a commercial variety that combines the advantages of types u and U requires fine tuning, but may be feasible.Furthermore, breeders of modern tomato cultivars typically strive to produce tomato plants exhibiting improved yield, shelf life, size, and tolerance/resistance to various environmental pressures, including disease|tomato
However, these breeding efforts have yielded unintended negative consequences on various tomato fruit attributes|tomato
For instance, linkage drag is a phenomenon that has been responsible for alterations in the metabolism of the tomato fruit|tomato
Linkage drag describes the introduction of an undesired trait or allele into a plant during backcrossing|tomato
This trait/allele is physically linked (or is very close) to the desired allele along the chromosome|tomato
In introducing the beneficial allele, there exists a high likelihood that the poor allele is also incorporated into the plant|tomato
Thus, breeding efforts attempting to enhance certain traits (for example|tomato
larger fruit size) have unintentionally altered production of chemicals associated with, for instance, nutritional value and flavor.Breeders have turned to using wild tomato species as a source of alleles for the introduction of beneficial traits into modern tomato varieties|tomato
For example, wild tomato relatives may possess higher amounts of fruit solids (which are associated with greater sugar content) or resistance to diseases caused by microbes, such as resistance towards the early blight pathogen Alternaria solani|tomato
However, this tactic has limitations, for the incorporation of certain traits, such as pathogen resistance, can negatively impact other favorable phenotypes (fruit production, etc.).|tomato
The tomato is grown worldwide for its edible fruits, with thousands of cultivars|tomato
A fertilizer with an NPK ratio of 5–10–10 is often sold as tomato fertilizer or vegetable fertilizer, although manure and compost are also used|tomato
On average there are 150,000 seeds in a pound of tomato seeds.|tomato
Tomato cultivars vary widely in their resistance to disease|tomato
Modern hybrids focus on improving disease resistance over the heirloom plants.|tomato
Various forms of mildew and blight are common tomato afflictions, which is why tomato cultivars are often marked with a combination of letters that refer to specific disease resistance|tomato
The most common letters are|tomato
LB – late blight, V – verticillium wilt, F – fusarium wilt strain I, FF – fusarium wilt strain I and II, N – nematodes, T – tobacco mosaic virus, and A – alternaria.|tomato
Some common tomato pests are the tomato bug, stink bugs, cutworms, tomato hornworms and tobacco hornworms, aphids, cabbage loopers, whiteflies, tomato fruitworms, flea beetles, red spider mite, slugs, and Colorado potato beetles|tomato
The tomato russet mite, Aculops lycopersici, feeds on foliage and young fruit of tomato plants, causing shrivelling and necrosis of leaves, flowers, and fruit, possibly killing the plant.A common tomato disease is tobacco mosaic virus|tomato
Handling cigarettes and other infected tobacco products can transmit the virus to tomato plants.Another particularly dreaded disease is curly top, carried by the beet leafhopper, which interrupts the lifecycle|tomato
As the name implies, it has the symptom of making the top leaves of the plant wrinkle up and grow abnormally.After an insect attack tomato plants produce systemin, a plant peptide hormone |tomato
Systemin activates defensive mechanisms, such as the production of protease inhibitors to slow the growth of insects|tomato
The hormone was first identified in tomatoes, but similar proteins have been identified in other species since.Although not a disease as such, irregular supplies of water can cause growing or ripening fruit to split|tomato
Besides cosmetic damage, the splits may allow decay to start, although growing fruits have some ability to heal after a split|tomato
In addition, a deformity called cat-facing can be caused by pests, temperature stress, or poor soil conditions|tomato
Affected fruit usually remains edible, but its appearance may be unsightly.|tomato
Among the most famous pairings is the tomato plant and carrots; studies supporting this relationship have produced a popular book about companion planting, Carrots Love Tomatoes.The devastating tomato hornworm has a major predator in various parasitic wasps, whose larvae devour the hornworm, but whose adult form drinks nectar from tiny-flowered plants like umbellifers|tomato
Several species of umbellifer are therefore often grown with tomato plants, including parsley, Queen Anne's lace, and occasionally dill|tomato
These also attract predatory flies that attack various tomato pests.Borage is thought to repel the tomato hornworm moth.Plants with strong scents, like alliums (onions, chives, garlic), mints (basil, oregano, spearmint) and French marigold, (Tagetes patula) are thought to mask the scent of the tomato plant, making it harder for pests to locate it, or to provide an alternative landing point, reducing the odds of the pests from attacking the correct plant|tomato
These plants may also subtly affect the flavor of tomato fruit.Tomato plants can protect asparagus from asparagus beetles, because they contain solanine that kills this pest, while asparagus plants contain Asparagusic acid that repels nematodes known to attack tomato plants|tomato
Marigolds also repel nematodes.|tomato
In the wild, original state, tomatoes required cross-pollination; they were much more self-incompatible than domestic cultivars|tomato
As a floral device to reduce selfing, the pistil of wild tomatoes extends farther out of the flower than today's cultivars|tomato
The stamens were, and remain, entirely within the closed corolla.|tomato
As tomatoes were moved from their native areas, their traditional pollinators, (probably a species of halictid bee) did not move with them|tomato
The trait of self-fertility became an advantage, and domestic cultivars of tomato have been selected to maximize this trait.This is not the same as self-pollination, despite the common claim that tomatoes do so|tomato
"That tomatoes pollinate themselves poorly without outside aid is clearly shown in greenhouse situations, where pollination must be aided by artificial wind, vibration of the plants (one brand of vibrator is a wand called an ""electric bee"" that is used manually), or more often today, by cultured bumblebees"|tomato
The anther of a tomato flower is shaped like a hollow tube, with the pollen produced within the structure, rather than on the surface, as in most species|tomato
The pollen moves through pores in the anther, but very little pollen is shed without some kind of externally-induced motion|tomato
The ideal vibratory frequencies to release pollen grains are provided by an insect, such as a bumblebee, or the original wild halictid pollinator, capable of engaging in a behavior known as buzz pollination, which honey bees cannot perform|tomato
In an outdoors setting, wind or animals usually provide sufficient motion to produce commercially viable crops.|tomato
Pollination and fruit formation depend on meiosis|tomato
Meiosis is central to the processes by which diploid microspore mother cells within the anther give rise to haploid pollen grains, and megaspore mother cells in ovules that are contained within the ovary give rise to haploid nuclei|tomato
Union of haploid nuclei from pollen and ovule (fertilization) can occur either by self- or cross-pollination|tomato
Fertilization leads to the formation of a diploid zygote that can then develop into an embryo within the emerging seed|tomato
Repeated fertilizations within the ovary are accompanied by maturation of the ovary to form the tomato fruit.|tomato
Homologs of the recA gene, including rad51, play a key role in homologous recombinational repair of DNA during meiosis|tomato
A rad51 homolog is present in the anther of tomato (Lycopersicon esculentum), suggesting that recombinational repair occurs during meiosis in tomato.|tomato
Tomatoes are often grown in greenhouses in cooler climates, and cultivars such as the British 'Moneymaker' and a number of cultivars grown in Siberia are specifically bred for indoor growing|tomato
In more temperate climates, it is not uncommon to start seeds in greenhouses during the late winter for future transplant.|tomato
Greenhouse tomato production in large-acreage commercial greenhouses and owner-operator stand-alone or multiple-bay greenhouses is on the increase, providing fruit during those times of the year when field-grown fruit is not readily available|tomato
Smaller sized fruit (cherry and grape), or cluster tomatoes (fruit-on-the-vine) are the fruit of choice for the large commercial greenhouse operators while the beefsteak varieties are the choice of owner-operator growers.Hydroponic technique is often used in hostile growing environments, as well as high-density plantings.|tomato
"To facilitate transportation and storage, tomatoes are often picked unripe (green) and ripened in storage with ethylene.A machine-harvestable variety of tomato (the ""square tomato"") was developed in the 1950s by University of California, Davis's Gordie C"|tomato
Hanna, which, in combination with the development of a suitable harvester, revolutionized the tomato-growing industry|tomato
This type of tomato is grown commercially near plants that process and can tomatoes, tomato sauce, and tomato paste|tomato
They are harvested when ripe and are flavorful when picked|tomato
They are harvested 24 hours a day, seven days a week during a 12- to 14-week season, and immediately transported to packing plants, which operate on the same schedule|tomato
California is a center of this sort of commercial tomato production and produces about a third of the processed tomatoes produced in the world.In 1994, Calgene introduced a genetically modified tomato called the FlavrSavr, which could be vine ripened without compromising shelf life|tomato
However, the product was not commercially successful, and was sold only until 1997.|tomato
"As of 2008, the heaviest tomato harvested, weighed 3.51 kg (7 lb 12 oz), was of the cultivar ""Delicious"", and was grown by Gordon Graham of Edmond, Oklahoma in 1986"|tomato
"The largest tomato plant grown was of the cultivar ""Sungold"" and reached 19.8 m (65 ft) in length, grown by Nutriculture Ltd (UK) of Mawdesley, Lancashire, UK, in 2000.A massive ""tomato tree"" growing inside the Walt Disney World Resort's experimental greenhouses in Lake Buena Vista, Florida may have been the largest single tomato plant in the world"|tomato
The plant has been recognized as a Guinness World Record Holder, with a harvest of more than 32,000 tomatoes and a total weight of 522 kg (1,151 lb)|tomato
It yielded thousands of tomatoes at one time from a single vine|tomato
Yong Huang, Epcot's manager of agricultural science, discovered the unique plant in Beijing, China|tomato

Although tomatoes originated in the Americas, they have become extensively used in Mediterranean cuisine|tomato
Ripe tomatoes contain significant umami flavor and they are a key ingredient in pizza, and are commonly used in pasta sauces.|tomato
The tomato is now grown and eaten around the world|tomato
It is used in diverse ways, including raw in salads or in slices, stewed, incorporated into a wide variety of dishes, or processed into ketchup or tomato soup|tomato
Unripe green tomatoes can also be breaded and fried, used to make salsa, or pickled|tomato
Tomato juice is sold as a drink, and is used in cocktails such as the Bloody Mary.|tomato
Tomatoes keep best unwashed at room temperature and out of direct sunlight|tomato
It is not recommended to refrigerate them as this can harm the flavour|tomato
Tomatoes stored cold tend to lose their flavour permanently.Storing stem down can prolong shelf life, as it may keep from rotting too quickly.Tomatoes that are not yet ripe can be kept in a paper bag till ripening.Tomatoes are easy to preserve whole, in pieces, as tomato sauce or paste by home canning|tomato
They are acidic enough to process in a water bath rather than a pressure cooker as most vegetables require|tomato
The fruit is also preserved by drying, often in the sun, and sold either in bags or in jars with oil.|tomato
The leaves, stem, and green unripe fruit of the tomato plant contain small amounts of the alkaloid tomatine, whose effect on humans has not been studied|tomato
They also contain small amounts of solanine, a toxic alkaloid found in potato leaves and other plants in the nightshade family|tomato
However, solanine concentrations in foliage and green fruit are generally too small to be dangerous unless large amounts are consumed—for example, as greens.|tomato
Small amounts of tomato foliage are sometimes used for flavoring without ill effect, and the green fruit of unripe red tomato varieties is sometimes used for cooking, particularly as fried green tomatoes|tomato
There are also tomato varieties with fully ripe fruit that is still green|tomato
Compared to potatoes, the amount of solanine in unripe green or fully ripe tomatoes is low|tomato
However, even in the case of potatoes, while solanine poisoning resulting from dosages several times the normal human consumption has been demonstrated, actual cases of poisoning from excessive consumption of potatoes are rare.Tomato plants can be toxic to dogs if they eat large amounts of the fruit, or chew plant material.|tomato
Tomatoes were linked to seven Salmonella outbreaks between 1990 and 2005, and may have been the cause of a salmonellosis outbreak causing 172 illnesses in 18 US states in 2006|tomato
The 2008 United States salmonellosis outbreak caused the temporary removal of tomatoes from stores and restaurants across the United States and parts of Canada, although other foods, including jalapeño and serrano peppers, may have been involved.|tomato
A tomato is 95% water, contains 4% carbohydrates and less than 1% each of fat and protein (table)|tomato

Alexander W|tomato
Livingston, of Reynoldsburg, Ohio, played a large part in popularizing the tomato in the late 19th century; his efforts are commemorated in Reynoldsburg with an annual Tomato Festival.|tomato
"Tomatoes are a popular ""nonlethal"" throwing weapon in mass protests, and there was a common tradition of throwing rotten tomatoes at bad performers on a stage during the 19th century; today this is usually referenced as a metaphor"|tomato
Embracing it for this protest connotation, the Dutch Socialist party adopted the tomato as their logo.|tomato
"The US city of Reynoldsburg, Ohio calls itself ""The Birthplace of the Tomato"", claiming the first commercial variety of tomato was bred there in the 19th century.""Rotten Tomatoes"" is an American review-aggregation website for film and television"|tomato
"The name ""Rotten Tomatoes"" derives from the practice of audiences throwing rotten tomatoes when disapproving of a poor stage performance"|tomato
"""Rotten Tomatoes"" took the tomato metaphor further by rating films as Certified Fresh if they got a score of 75% or higher, Fresh for films with a score of 60% or higher that do not meet the requirements for the Certified Fresh seal, and Rotten for films with a score of 0–59%."|tomato

Cucumber (Cucumis sativus) is a widely-cultivated creeping vine plant in the Cucurbitaceae gourd family that bears usually cylindrical fruits, which are used as vegetables|cucumber
Considered an annual plant, there are three main varieties of cucumber — slicing, pickling, and burpless/seedless — within which several cultivars have been created|cucumber
The cucumber originates from South Asia, but now grows on most continents, as many different types of cucumber are traded on the global market|cucumber
In North America, the term wild cucumber refers to plants in the genera Echinocystis and Marah, though the two are not closely related.|cucumber
The cucumber is a creeping vine that roots in the ground and grows up trellises or other supporting frames, wrapping around supports with thin, spiraling tendrils|cucumber
The plant may also root in a soilless medium, whereby it will sprawl along the ground in lieu of a supporting structure|cucumber
The vine has large leaves that form a canopy over the fruits.The fruit of typical cultivars of cucumber is roughly cylindrical, but elongated with tapered ends, and may be as large as 62 centimeters (24 in) long and 10 centimeters (4 in) in diameter.Cucumber fruits consist of 95% water (see nutrition table)|cucumber
In botanical terms, the cucumber is classified as a pepo, a type of botanical berry with a hard outer rind and no internal divisions|cucumber
However, much like tomatoes and squashes, it is often perceived, prepared, and eaten as a vegetable.|cucumber
Most cucumber cultivars are seeded and require pollination|cucumber
For this purpose, thousands of honey beehives are annually carried to cucumber fields just before bloom|cucumber
Cucumbers may also be pollinated via bumblebees and several other bee species|cucumber
Most cucumbers that require pollination are self-incompatible, thus requiring the pollen of another plant in order to form seeds and fruit|cucumber
Some self-compatible cultivars exist that are related to the 'Lemon' cultivar.A few cultivars of cucumber are parthenocarpic, the blossoms of which create seedless fruit without pollination, which degrades the eating quality of these cultivar|cucumber
In the United States, these are usually grown in greenhouses, where bees are excluded|cucumber
In Europe, they are grown outdoors in some regions, where bees are likewise excluded.Traditional cultivars produce male blossoms first, then female, in about equivalent numbers|cucumber
Newer gynoecious hybrid cultivars produce almost all female blossoms|cucumber
They may have a pollenizer cultivar interplanted, and the number of beehives per unit area is increased, but temperature changes induce male flowers even on these plants, which may be sufficient for pollination to occur.In 2009, an international team of researchers announced they had sequenced the cucumber genome.|cucumber
In a 100-gram (3+1⁄2-ounce) reference serving, raw cucumber (with peel) is 95% water, 4% carbohydrates, 1% protein, and contains negligible fat|cucumber
Cucumber provides 67 kilojoules (16 kilocalories) of food energy, and supplies low content of micronutrients, as it is notable only for vitamin K at 16% of the Daily Value (table).|cucumber
Depending on variety, cucumbers may have a mild melon aroma and flavor, in part resulting from unsaturated aldehydes, such as (E,Z)-nona-2,6-dienal, and the cis- and trans- isomers of 2-nonenal|cucumber
The slightly bitter taste of cucumber rind results from cucurbitacins.|cucumber
In general cultivation, cucumbers are classified into three main cultivar groups|cucumber
slicing, pickled, and seedless/burpless.|cucumber
Cucumbers grown to eat fresh are called slicing cucumbers|cucumber
The main varieties of slicers mature on vines with large leaves that provide shading.Slicers grown commercially for the North American market are generally longer, smoother, more uniform in color, and have much tougher skin|cucumber
In contrast, those in other countries, often called European cucumbers, are smaller and have thinner, more delicate skin, often with fewer seeds, thus are often being sold in plastic skin for protection|cucumber
This variety may also be called a telegraph cucumber, particularly in Australasia.|cucumber
Pickling with brine, sugar, vinegar, and spices creates various flavored products from cucumbers and other foods|cucumber
Although any cucumber can be pickled, commercial pickles are made from cucumbers specially bred for uniformity of length-to-diameter ratio and lack of voids in the flesh|cucumber
Those cucumbers intended for pickling, called picklers, grow to about 7 to 10 cm (3 to 4 in) long and 2.5 cm (1 in) wide|cucumber
Compared to slicers, picklers tend to be shorter, thicker, less-regularly shaped, and have bumpy skin with tiny white or black-dotted spines|cucumber
Color can vary from creamy yellow to pale or dark green.|cucumber
Gherkins, also called cornichons, or baby pickles, are small cucumbers, typically those 2.5 to 12.5 centimetres (1 to 5 in) in length, often with bumpy skin, which are typically used for pickling|cucumber
The word gherkin comes from the early modern Dutch gurken or augurken ('small pickled cucumber')|cucumber
The term is also used in the name for Cucumis anguria, the West Indian gherkin, a closely related species.|cucumber
Burpless cucumbers are sweeter and have a thinner skin than other varieties of cucumber|cucumber
They are reputed to be easy to digest and to have a pleasant taste|cucumber
They can grow as long as 60 centimeters (2 ft), are nearly seedless, and have a delicate skin|cucumber
Most commonly grown in greenhouses, these parthenocarpic cucumbers are often found in grocery markets, shrink-wrapped in plastic|cucumber
They are marketed as either burpless or seedless, as the seeds and skin of other varieties of cucumbers are said to give some people gas.|cucumber
Cultivated for at least 3,000 years, the cucumber originated from India, where a great many varieties have been observed, along with its closest living relative, Cucumis hystrix|cucumber
It was probably introduced to Europe by the Greeks or Romans|cucumber
Records of cucumber cultivation appear in France in the 9th century, England in the 14th century, and in North America by the mid-16th century.|cucumber
According to Pliny the Elder, the Emperor Tiberius had the cucumber on his table daily during summer and winter|cucumber
In order to have it available for his table every day of the year, the Romans reportedly used artificial methods of growing (similar to the greenhouse system), whereby mirrorstone refers to Pliny's lapis specularis, believed to have been sheet mica:|cucumber
Reportedly, they were also cultivated in specularia, cucumber houses glazed with oiled cloth|cucumber
Pliny describes the Italian fruit as very small, probably like a gherkin|cucumber
He also describes the preparation of a medication known as elaterium|cucumber
However, some scholars believe that he was instead referring to Ecballium elaterium, known in pre-Linnean times as Cucumis silvestris or Cucumis asininus ('wild cucumber' or 'donkey cucumber'), a species different from the common cucumber|cucumber
"Pliny also writes about several other varieties of cucumber, including the cultivated cucumber, and remedies from the different types (9 from the cultivated; 5 from the ""anguine;"" and 26 from the ""wild"")."|cucumber
Charlemagne had cucumbers grown in his gardens in the 8th/9th century|cucumber
They were reportedly introduced into England in the early 14th century, lost, then reintroduced approximately 250 years later|cucumber
The Spaniards (through the Italian Christopher Columbus) brought cucumbers to Haiti in 1494|cucumber
"In 1535, Jacques Cartier, a French explorer, found ""very great cucumbers"" grown on the site of what is now Montreal."|cucumber
Throughout the 16th century, European trappers, traders, bison hunters, and explorers bartered for the products of American Indian agriculture|cucumber
The tribes of the Great Plains and the Rocky Mountains learned from the Spanish how to grow European crops|cucumber
The farmers on the Great Plains included the Mandan and Abenaki|cucumber
They obtained cucumbers and watermelons from the Spanish, and added them to the crops they were already growing, including several varieties of corn and beans, pumpkins, squash, and gourd plants|cucumber
The Iroquois were also growing them when the first Europeans visited them.|cucumber
In 1630, the Reverend Francis Higginson produced a book called New-Englands Plantation in which, describing a garden on Conant's Island in Boston Harbor known as The Governor's Garden, he states:The countrie aboundeth naturally with store of roots of great varietie [sic] and good to eat|cucumber
Our turnips, parsnips, and carrots are here both bigger and sweeter than is ordinary to be found in England|cucumber
Here are store of pompions, cowcumbers, and other things of that nature which I know not…In New England Prospect (1633, England), William Wood published observations he made in 1629 in America:The ground affords very good kitchin gardens, for Turneps, Parsnips, Carrots, Radishes, and Pompions, Muskmillons, Isquoter-squashes, coucumbars, Onyons, and whatever grows well in England grows as well there, many things being better and larger|cucumber
[sic]|cucumber
In the later 17th century, a prejudice developed against uncooked vegetables and fruits|cucumber
A number of articles in contemporary health publications stated that uncooked plants brought on summer diseases and should be forbidden to children|cucumber
"The cucumber kept this reputation for an inordinate period of time, ""fit only for consumption by cows,"" which some believe is why it gained the name, cowcumber."|cucumber

Spinach (Spinacia oleracea) is a leafy green flowering plant native to central and western Asia|spinach
It is of the order Caryophyllales, family Amaranthaceae, subfamily Chenopodioideae|spinach
Its leaves are a common edible vegetable consumed either fresh, or after storage using preservation techniques by canning, freezing, or dehydration|spinach
It may be eaten cooked or raw, and the taste differs considerably; the high oxalate content may be reduced by steaming.|spinach
It is an annual plant (rarely biennial), growing as tall as 30 cm (1 ft)|spinach
Spinach may overwinter in temperate regions|spinach
The leaves are alternate, simple, ovate to triangular, and very variable in size|spinach
2–30 cm (1–12 in) long and 1–15 cm (0.4–5.9 in) broad, with larger leaves at the base of the plant and small leaves higher on the flowering stem|spinach
The flowers are inconspicuous, yellow-green, 3–4 mm (0.1–0.2 in) in diameter, and mature into a small, hard, dry, lumpy fruit cluster 5–10 mm (0.2–0.4 in) across containing several seeds|spinach
"The English word ""spinach"" dates to the late 14th century from espinache (French"|spinach
épinard).|spinach
Common spinach (S|spinach
oleracea) was long considered to be in the family Chenopodiaceae, but in 2003 that family was merged into the Amaranthaceae in the order Caryophyllales|spinach
Within the family Amaranthaceae sensu lato, Spinach belongs to the subfamily Chenopodioideae.|spinach
Raw spinach is 91% water, 4% carbohydrates, 3% protein, and contains negligible fat|spinach
In a 100 g (3.5 oz) serving providing only 23 calories, spinach has a high nutritional value, especially when fresh, frozen, steamed, or quickly boiled|spinach
It is a rich source (20% or more of the Daily Value, DV) of vitamin A, vitamin C, vitamin K, magnesium, manganese, iron and folate|spinach
Spinach is a good source (10-19% of DV) of the B vitamins riboflavin and vitamin B6, vitamin E, calcium, potassium, and dietary fiber|spinach
Although spinach is touted as being high in iron and calcium content, and is often served and consumed in its raw form, raw spinach contains high levels of oxalates, which block absorption of calcium and iron in the stomach and small intestine|spinach
Spinach cooked in several changes of water has much lower levels of oxalates and is better digested and its nutrients absorbed more completely.|spinach
Spinach, along with other green, leafy vegetables, contains an appreciable amount of iron attaining 21% of the Daily Value in a 100 g (3.5 oz) amount of raw spinach|spinach
For example, the United States Department of Agriculture states that a 100 g (3.5 oz) serving of cooked spinach contains 3.57 mg of iron, whereas a 100 g (3.5 oz) ground hamburger patty contains 1.93 mg of iron|spinach
However, spinach contains iron absorption-inhibiting substances, including high levels of oxalate, which can bind to the iron to form ferrous oxalate and render much of the iron in spinach unusable by the body|spinach
In addition to preventing absorption and use, high levels of oxalates remove iron from the body.|spinach
Spinach also has a moderate calcium content which can be affected by oxalates, decreasing its absorption|spinach
The calcium in spinach is among the least bioavailable of food calcium sources|spinach
By way of comparison, the human body can absorb about half of the calcium present in broccoli, yet only around 5% of the calcium in spinach.|spinach
A quantity of 100 g of spinach contains over four times the recommended daily intake of vitamin K|spinach
For this reason, individuals taking the anticoagulant warfarin – which acts by inhibiting vitamin K – are instructed to minimize consumption of spinach (as well as other dark green leafy vegetables) to avoid blunting the effect of warfarin.|spinach
In 2018, world production of spinach was 26.3 million tonnes, with China alone accounting for 90% of the total.Fresh spinach is sold loose, bunched, or packaged fresh in bags|spinach
Fresh spinach loses much of its nutritional value with storage of more than a few days|spinach
Fresh spinach is packaged in air, or in nitrogen gas to extend shelf life|spinach
While refrigeration slows this effect to about eight days, fresh spinach loses most of its folate and carotenoid content over this period of time|spinach
For longer storage, it is canned, or blanched or cooked and frozen.Some packaged spinach is exposed to radiation to kill any harmful bacteria|spinach
The Food and Drug Administration approves of irradiation of spinach leaves up to 4.0 kilograys, having no or only a minor effect on nutrient content|spinach
Spinach may be high in cadmium contamination depending on the soil and location where the spinach is grown.|spinach
"Spinach is thought to have originated about 2,000 years ago in ancient Persia from which it was introduced to India and ancient China via Nepal in 647 AD as the ""Persian vegetable"""|spinach
In AD 827, the Saracens introduced spinach to Sicily|spinach
The first written evidence of spinach in the Mediterranean was recorded in three 10th-century works|spinach
a medical work by al-Rāzī (known as Rhazes in the West) and in two agricultural treatises, one by Ibn Waḥshīyah and the other by Qusṭus al-Rūmī|spinach
Spinach became a popular vegetable in the Arab Mediterranean and arrived in Spain by the latter part of the 12th century, where Ibn al-ʻAwwām called it raʼīs al-buqūl, 'the chieftain of leafy greens'|spinach
Spinach was also the subject of a special treatise in the 11th century by Ibn Ḥajjāj.Spinach first appeared in England and France in the 14th century, probably via Spain, and gained common use because it appeared in early spring when fresh local vegetables were not available|spinach
Spinach is mentioned in the first known English cookbook, the Forme of Cury (1390), where it is referred to as 'spinnedge' and 'spynoches'|spinach
During World War I, wine fortified with spinach juice was given to injured French soldiers with the intent to curtail their bleeding.|spinach
The comics and cartoon character Popeye the Sailor Man has been portrayed since 1931 as having a strong affinity for spinach, particularly the canned variety|spinach
He becomes physically stronger after consuming it|spinach
"This is usually attributed to the iron content of spinach, but in a 1932 strip, Popeye says ""spinach is full of vitamin A an' tha's what makes hoomans strong and helty""."|spinach
