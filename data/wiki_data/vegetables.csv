Broccoli|broccoli|Broccoli (Brassica oleracea var
Broccoli|broccoli|italica) is an edible green plant in the cabbage family (family Brassicaceae, genus Brassica) whose large flowering head, stalk and small associated leaves are eaten as a vegetable
Broccoli|broccoli|Broccoli is classified in the Italica cultivar group of the species Brassica oleracea
Broccoli|broccoli|Broccoli has large flower heads, usually dark green, arranged in a tree-like structure branching out from a thick stalk which is usually light green
Broccoli|broccoli|The mass of flower heads is surrounded by leaves
Broccoli|broccoli|Broccoli resembles cauliflower, which is a different, but closely related cultivar group of the same Brassica species.
Broccoli|broccoli|It is eaten either raw or cooked
Broccoli|broccoli|Broccoli is a particularly rich source of vitamin C and vitamin K
Broccoli|broccoli|"Contents of its characteristic sulfur-containing glucosinolate compounds, isothiocyanates and sulforaphane, are diminished by boiling, but are better preserved by steaming, microwaving or stir-frying.Rapini, sometimes called ""broccoli rabe,"" is a distinct species from broccoli, forming similar but smaller heads and is actually a type of turnip (Brassica rapa)."
Broccoli|broccoli|Broccoli resulted from breeding of landrace Brassica crops in the northern Mediterranean starting in about the sixth century BCE
Broccoli|broccoli|Broccoli has its origins in primitive cultivars grown in the Roman Empire and was most likely improved via artificial selection in the southern Italian Peninsula or in Sicily
Broccoli|broccoli|Broccoli was spread to northern Europe by the 18th century and brought to North America in the 19th century by Italian immigrants
Broccoli|broccoli|After the Second World War, breeding of United States and Japanese F1 hybrids increased yields, quality, growth speed, and regional adaptation, which produced the cultivars that have been the most popular since then
Broccoli|broccoli|'Premium Crop', 'Packman', and 'Marathon'.
Broccoli|broccoli|Other cultivar groups of Brassica oleracea include cabbage (Capitata Group), cauliflower and Romanesco broccoli (Botrytis Group), kale (Acephala Group), collard (Viridis Group), kohlrabi (Gongylodes Group), Brussels sprouts (Gemmifera Group), and kai-lan (Alboglabra Group)
Broccoli|broccoli|As these groups are the same species, they readily hybridize
Broccoli|broccoli|"for example, Broccolini or ""Tenderstem broccoli"" is a cross between broccoli and Kai-lan"
Broccoli|broccoli|"Broccoli cultivars form the genetic basis of the ""tropical cauliflowers"" commonly grown in South and Southeastern Asia, although they produce a more cauliflower-like head in warmer conditions."
Broccoli|broccoli|There are three commonly grown types of broccoli
Broccoli|broccoli|"The most familiar is Calabrese broccoli, often referred to simply as ""broccoli"", named after Calabria in Italy"
Broccoli|broccoli|It has large (10 to 20 cm) green heads and thick stalks
Broccoli|broccoli|It is a cool-season annual crop
Broccoli|broccoli|Sprouting broccoli (white or purple) has a larger number of heads with many thin stalks
Broccoli|broccoli|Purple cauliflower or Violet Cauliflower is a type of broccoli grown in Europe and North America
Broccoli|broccoli|It has a head shaped like cauliflower, but consisting of many tiny flower buds
Broccoli|broccoli|It sometimes, but not always, has a purple cast to the tips of the flower buds
Broccoli|broccoli|Purple cauliflower may also be white, red, green, or other colors.Other popular cultivars include Belstar, Blue Wind, Coronado Crown, Destiny, DiCicco, Green Goliath, Green Magic, Purple Sprouting, Romanesco, Sun King and Waltham 29.Beneforté is a variety of broccoli containing 2–3 times more glucoraphanin and produced by crossing broccoli with a wild Brassica variety, Brassica oleracea var villosa.
Broccoli|broccoli|The majority of broccoli cultivars are cool-weather crops that do poorly in hot summer weather
Broccoli|broccoli|Broccoli grows best when exposed to an average daily temperature between 18 and 23 °C (64 and 73 °F)
Broccoli|broccoli|"When the cluster of flowers, also referred to as a ""head"" of broccoli, appear in the center of the plant, the cluster is generally green"
Broccoli|broccoli|Garden pruners or shears are used to cut the head about 25 mm (1 in) from the tip
Broccoli|broccoli|Broccoli should be harvested before the flowers on the head bloom bright yellow.
Broccoli|broccoli|In 2019, global production of broccoli (combined for production reports with cauliflowers) was 27 million tonnes, with China and India together accounting for 73% of the world total
Broccoli|broccoli|Secondary producers, each having about one million tonnes or less annually, were the United States, Spain, and Mexico.
Broccoli|broccoli|A 100 gram reference serving of raw broccoli provides 34 calories and is a rich source (20% or higher of the Daily Value, DV) of vitamin C (107% DV) and vitamin K (97% DV) (table)
Broccoli|broccoli|Raw broccoli also contains moderate amounts (10–19% DV) of several B vitamins and the dietary mineral manganese, whereas other micronutrients are low in content (less than 10% DV)
Broccoli|broccoli|Raw broccoli is 89% water, 7% carbohydrates, 3% protein, and contains negligible fat (table).
Broccoli|broccoli|The perceived bitterness of cruciferous vegetables, such as broccoli, results from glucosinolates and their hydrolysis products, particularly isothiocyanates and other sulfur-containing compounds
Broccoli|broccoli|Preliminary research indicates that genetic inheritance through the gene TAS2R38 may be responsible in part for bitter taste perception in broccoli.
Broccolini|broccoli|Broccolini or baby broccoli is a green vegetable similar to broccoli but with smaller florets and longer, thin stalks
Broccolini|broccoli|"It is a hybrid of broccoli and gai lan (which is sometimes referred to as ""Chinese kale"" or ""Chinese broccoli""), both cultivar groups of Brassica oleracea"
Broccolini|broccoli|The name broccolini is a registered trademark of Mann Packing.
Broccolini|broccoli|Broccolini was originally developed over eight years by the Sakata Seed Company of Yokohama, Japan
Broccolini|broccoli|It was developed as a hybrid of broccoli and Chinese broccoli, rather than being genetically modified.Sakata partnered with Sanbon Incorporated in 1994 to begin growing the product commercially in Mexico under the name Asparation, implying a similarity to asparagus due to the slim, edible stem
Broccolini|broccoli|After first becoming available in US markets in 1996, in 1998 Sakata began a partnership with Mann Packing Company in Salinas, California, and marketed the product as Broccolini
Broccolini|broccoli|New forms of broccolini continue to be developed, including purple broccolini.
Broccolini|broccoli|Broccolini has a similar structure to sprouting-type broccoli
Broccolini|broccoli|It grows to 80 centimeters, with a slender elongated stem that is 15–30 centimeters long
Broccolini|broccoli|It is annual or biennial, herbaceous and glaucous.
Broccolini|broccoli|The entire vegetable (leaves, young stems, unopened flower shoots, and flowers) is consumable
Broccolini|broccoli|Its flavor is sweet, with notes of both broccoli and asparagus, although it is not closely related to the latter.
Broccolini|broccoli|Common cooking methods include sauteeing, steaming, boiling, and stir frying
Broccolini|broccoli|According to a 2005 Horticulture Australia study, 78% of people in Australia steam broccolini, 53% stir fry it, and 3% eat it raw or in a salad
Broccolini|broccoli|It is usually eaten steamed in Japan, where it is highly popular as a spring vegetable.
Broccolini|broccoli|Broccolini is high in vitamin C and contains a significant amount of vitamin A and dietary fiber
Broccolini|broccoli|One cup (122 g/4.3 oz) contains 37 calories (155 kJ) with 105% of daily vitamin C intake, 39% of vitamin A needs and 15% of dietary fibre needs
Broccolini|broccoli|Broccolini also contains potassium, calcium and iron in smaller amounts.
Broccolini|broccoli|Broccolini grows in cool climates and is intolerant of extreme climates
Broccolini|broccoli|It is more sensitive to cold temperatures than broccoli but less sensitive to hot temperatures.
Broccolini|broccoli|Broccolini takes 50–60 days to grow after being transplanted
Broccolini|broccoli|It is harvested when the heads are fully developed but are not flowering
Broccolini|broccoli|By cutting off the head, the harvest time is extended by four weeks as new shoots of smaller heads will grow
Broccolini|broccoli|After being harvested, the plant is cooled to 0 °C, preventing the flower heads developing.Broccolini is grown near the central California coast during the spring, summer, and fall seasons and Yuma, Arizona, throughout the winter
Broccolini|broccoli|It is sold throughout the United States, Canada, and the United Kingdom, as well as five states in Australia.
Broccolini|broccoli|"The International Federation for Produce Standards assigns it the price look-up code 3277, ""baby broccoli"""
Broccolini|broccoli|"It is also known as asparation, asparations, ""sweet baby broccoli"", broccoletti, and broccolette ""Italian Sprouting broccoli"","
Broccolini|broccoli|"In Brazil, the common form of the word broccoli (""brócolis"") refers to broccolini; the more traditional broccoli is called ""brócolis americano"" (American broccoli) or ""brócolis ninja"" (ninja broccoli)"
Broccolini|broccoli|It is sold under the registered trade marks BIMI and TENDERSTEM.
Epicuticular wax|broccoli|Epicuticular wax is a coating of wax covering the outer surface of the plant cuticle in land plants
Epicuticular wax|broccoli|It may form a whitish film or bloom on leaves, fruits and other plant organs
Epicuticular wax|broccoli|Chemically, it consists of hydrophobic organic compounds, mainly straight-chain aliphatic hydrocarbons with or without a variety of substituted functional groups
Epicuticular wax|broccoli|The main functions of the epicuticular wax are to decrease surface wetting and moisture loss
Epicuticular wax|broccoli|Other functions include reflection of ultraviolet light, assisting in the formation of an ultrahydrophobic and self-cleaning surface and acting as an anti-climb surface.
Epicuticular wax|broccoli|Common constituents of epicuticular wax are predominantly straight-chain aliphatic hydrocarbons that may be saturated or unsaturated and contain a variety of functional groups
Epicuticular wax|broccoli|Paraffins occur in leaves of peas and cabbages, alkyl esters in leaves of carnauba palm and banana, the asymmetrical secondary alcohol 10-nonacosanol in most gymnosperms such as Ginkgo biloba and Sitka spruce, many of the Ranunculaceae, Papaveraceae and Rosaceae and some mosses, symmetrical secondary alcohols in Brassicaceae including Arabidopsis thaliana, primary alcohols (mostly octacosan-1-ol) in most grasses Poaceae, Eucalyptus and legumes among many other plant groups, β-diketones in many grasses, Eucalyptus, box Buxus and the Ericaceae, aldehydes in young beech leaves, sugarcane culms and lemon fruit and triterpenes in fruit waxes of apple, plum and grape
Epicuticular wax|broccoli|Cyclic constituents are often recorded in epicuticular waxes but are generally minor constituents
Epicuticular wax|broccoli|They may include phytosterols such as β-sitosterol and pentacyclic triterpenoids such as ursolic acid and oleanolic acid and their respective precursors, α-amyrin and β-amyrin.
Epicuticular wax|broccoli|Many species of the genus Primula and ferns such as Cheilanthes, Pityrogramma and Notholaena produce a mealy, whitish to pale yellow glandular secretion known as farina that is not an epicuticular wax, but consists largely of crystals of a different class of polyphenolic compounds known as flavonoids
Epicuticular wax|broccoli|Unlike epicuticular wax, farina is secreted by specialised glandular hairs, rather than by the cuticle of the entire epidermis.
Epicuticular wax|broccoli|Epicuticular waxes are mostly solids at ambient temperature, with melting points above about 40 °C (100 °F)
Epicuticular wax|broccoli|They are soluble in organic solvents such as chloroform and hexane, making them accessible for chemical analysis, but in some species esterification of acids and alcohols into estolides or the polymerization of aldehydes may give rise to insoluble compounds
Epicuticular wax|broccoli|Solvent extracts of cuticle waxes contain both epicuticular and cuticular waxes, often contaminated with cell membrane lipids of underlying cells
Epicuticular wax|broccoli|Epicuticular wax can now also be isolated by mechanical methods that distinguish the epicuticular wax outside the plant cuticle from the cuticular wax embedded in the cuticle polymer
Epicuticular wax|broccoli|As a consequence, these two are now known to be chemically distinct, although the mechanism that segregates the molecular species into the two layers is unknown
Epicuticular wax|broccoli|Recent scanning electron microscopy (SEM), atomic force microscopy (AFM) and neutron reflectometry studies on reconstituted wax films have found wheat epicuticular waxes; made up of surface epicuticular crystals and an underlying, porous background film layer to undergo swelling when in contact with water, indicating the background film is permeable and susceptible to the transport of water.
Epicuticular wax|broccoli|Epicuticular wax can reflect UV light, such as the white, chalky, wax coating of Dudleya brittonii, which has the highest ultraviolet light (UV) reflectivity of any known naturally occurring biological substance.The term 'glaucous' is used to refer to any foliage, such as that of the family Crassulaceae, which appears whitish because of the waxy covering
Epicuticular wax|broccoli|Coatings of epicuticular flavonoids may  be referred to as 'farina', the plants themselves being described as 'farinose' or 'farinaceous'.
Epicuticular wax|broccoli|51
Epicuticular wax|broccoli|Epicuticular wax forms crystalline projections from the plant surface, which enhance their water repellency, create a self-cleaning property known as the lotus effect and reflect UV radiation
Epicuticular wax|broccoli|The shapes of the crystals are dependent on the wax compounds present in them
Epicuticular wax|broccoli|Asymmetrical secondary alcohols and β-diketones form hollow wax nanotubes, while primary alcohols and symmetrical secondary alcohols form flat plates Although these have been observed using the transmission electron microscope and scanning electron microscope the process of growth of the crystals had never been observed directly until Koch and coworkers studied growing wax crystals on leaves of snowdrop (Galanthus nivalis) and other species using the atomic force microscope
Epicuticular wax|broccoli|These studies show that the crystals grow by extension from their tips, raising interesting questions about the mechanism of transport of the molecules.
Microgreen|broccoli|Microgreens are vegetable greens (not to be confused with sprouts or shoots) harvested just after the cotyledon leaves have developed (and possibly, with one set of true leaves)
Microgreen|broccoli|They are used as a nutrition supplement, a visual enhancement, and a flavor and texture enhancement
Microgreen|broccoli|Microgreens can add sweetness and spiciness to foods
Microgreen|broccoli|Microgreens are smaller than “baby greens” because they are consumed very soon after sprouting, rather than after the plant has matured to produce multiple leaves
Microgreen|broccoli|Among upscale grocers, they are now considered a speciality genre of greens, good for garnishing salads, soups, sandwiches, and plates
Microgreen|broccoli|They can be used as a main vegetable as well in certain recipes for intense flavor and nutrition
Microgreen|broccoli|Many recipes use them as a garnish while some utilize them as the main ingredient
Microgreen|broccoli|For example, garlic pea shoots, pea shoots or micro cabbage in cabbage soup,  or coleslaw made with radish microgreen instead of cabbage
Microgreen|broccoli|As microgreens become more popular for their intense flavor and nutrition, innovative chefs and cooks create new ways to use them.
Microgreen|broccoli|Edible young greens are produced from various kinds of vegetables, herbs, or other plants
Microgreen|broccoli|They range in size from 1 to 3 inches (2.5 to 7.6 cm), including the stem and leaves
Microgreen|broccoli|The stem is cut just above the soil line during harvesting
Microgreen|broccoli|Microgreens have fully developed cotyledon leaves and usually, one pair of very small, partially developed true leaves.
Microgreen|broccoli|Microgreens began showing up on chefs' menus as early as the 1980s in San Francisco
Microgreen|broccoli|In Southern California, microgreens have been grown since about the mid‑90s
Microgreen|broccoli|Initially, a few varieties were offered; those available were
Microgreen|broccoli|"arugula, basil, beets, kale, cilantro, and a colorful mixture of those called a ""Rainbow Mix"""
Microgreen|broccoli|Having spread eastward from California, they are now being grown in most areas of the United States, with an increasing number of varieties
Microgreen|broccoli|Today, the U.S
Microgreen|broccoli|industry for microgreens consists of a variety of seed companies and growers.
Microgreen|broccoli|Microgreens have three basic parts
Microgreen|broccoli|a central stem, cotyledon leaf or leaves, and typically, the first pair of very young true leaves
Microgreen|broccoli|They vary in size depending upon the specific variety grown, with the typical size being 1 to 1.5 in (25 to 38 mm) in total length
Microgreen|broccoli|When the plant grows beyond this size, it should no longer be considered a microgreen
Microgreen|broccoli|Larger sizes have been called petite greens
Microgreen|broccoli|The average crop-time for fast-growing microgreens, such as many brassicas, is 10–14 days from seeding to harvest
Microgreen|broccoli|Slower growing microgreens, such as beets, chard, and many herbs, may take 16-25 days to reach harvestable size
Microgreen|broccoli|Both baby greens and microgreens lack any legal definition
Microgreen|broccoli|"The terms ""baby greens"" and ""microgreens"" are marketing terms used to describe their respective categories"
Microgreen|broccoli|Sprouts are germinated seeds and typically, are consumed as an entire plant (root, seed, and shoot), depending on the species
Microgreen|broccoli|For example, sprouts from almond, pumpkin, and peanut reportedly have a preferred flavor when harvested prior to root developments
Microgreen|broccoli|Sprouts are legally defined, and have additional regulations concerning their production and marketing due to their relatively high risk of microbial contamination compared to other greens
Microgreen|broccoli|Growers interested in producing sprouts for sale need to be aware of the risks and precautions summarized in the FDA publication Guidance for Industry
Microgreen|broccoli|Reducing Microbial Food Safety Hazards for Sprouted Seeds (FDA 1999).
Microgreen|broccoli|Growing microgreens is relatively easy, but yet is filled with challenges, ranging from preventing and managing fungus or mold growth to provided the right nutrients and growing media to the plants for getting quality produce
Microgreen|broccoli|"Many small ""backyard"" growers have sprung up selling their greens at farmers markets or to restaurants"
Microgreen|broccoli|A shallow plastic container with drainage holes, such as a nursery flat or prepackaged-salad box, will facilitate sprouting and grow out on a small scale.However, for commercial scale growing, specific trays suited to growing and supporting microgreens better have to be used
Microgreen|broccoli|Growing and marketing high-quality microgreens commercially is much more difficult, but also shows potential for providing better quality produce under controlled and sterile environments and could provide local communities with better nutritional diversity at scale
Microgreen|broccoli|Artificial lighting is not necessarily needed for growing microgreens, but is required for indoor commercial setups for growing them
Microgreen|broccoli|Microgreens can grow under various lighting conditions, including under indirect natural light and grow lights, but some source of light is necessary for them to reach to their true leaf stage or just before the time of harvest
Microgreen|broccoli|Different lighting conditions can change the flavors of the microgreens being grown
Microgreen|broccoli|For instance, corn microgreens are sweet when grown in the dark, but become bitter when exposed to light due to photosynthesis processes taking place in the sprouting plants.Nightshade family plants such as potatoes, tomatoes, eggplants, and peppers should not be grown and consumed as microgreens, since nightshade plant sprouts are poisonous
Microgreen|broccoli|Nightshade plant sprouts contain toxic alkaloids such as solanine and tropanes, which can cause adverse symptoms in the digestive and nervous systems.
Microgreen|broccoli|Researchers at the USDA Agricultural Research Service have published, as of early 2014, several studies that identify the nutritional make-up and the shelf life of microgreens
Microgreen|broccoli|Twenty-five varieties were tested, key nutrients measured were ascorbic acid (vitamin C), tocopherols (vitamin E), phylloquinone (vitamin K), and beta-carotene (a vitamin A precursor), plus other related carotenoids in the cotyledons.
Microgreen|broccoli|Among the 25 microgreens tested, red cabbage, cilantro, garnet amaranth, and green daikon radish had the highest concentrations respectively of vitamin C, carotenoids, vitamin K, and vitamin E
Microgreen|broccoli|In general, microgreens contained considerably higher levels of vitamins and carotenoids—about five times greater—than their mature plant counterparts, an indication that microgreens may be worth the trouble of delivering them fresh during their short lives.
Microgreen|broccoli|Sprouts are germinated or partially germinated seeds
Microgreen|broccoli|A sprout consists of the seed, root, stem, while microgreens are harvested without the roots.Microgreens have stronger flavors compared to sprouts, and come in a wide selection of leaf shapes, textures, and colors.
Microgreen|broccoli|Microgreens are grown in soil or soil-like materials such as peat moss
Microgreen|broccoli|Microgreens require high light levels, preferably natural sunlight with low humidity and good air circulation
Microgreen|broccoli|Microgreens are planted with very low seed density compared to sprout processing
Microgreen|broccoli|Crop times are generally one to two weeks for most varieties, although some can take four to six weeks
Microgreen|broccoli|Microgreens are ready to harvest when the cotyledons are fully expanded
Microgreen|broccoli|Harvesting is usually with scissors cutting just above the soil surface, excluding any roots
Microgreen|broccoli|Some growers sell them while still growing, rooted in the growing trays so that they may be cut later
Microgreen|broccoli|Once removed from their growing environment, these trays of microgreens must be used quickly or they will rapidly begin to elongate and lose color and flavor.
Microgreen|broccoli|Sprout seeds are soaked in water, usually for eight hours and then drained
Microgreen|broccoli|A high density of seed is placed inside of sprouting equipment or enclosed containers
Microgreen|broccoli|The seed germinates rapidly due to the high moisture and humidity levels maintained in the enclosures
Microgreen|broccoli|Seeds can also be sprouted in cloth bags that are repeatedly soaked in water
Microgreen|broccoli|The sprouting process occurs in dark or very low light conditions
Microgreen|broccoli|After a few days of soaking and repeated rinsing in water (several times a day to minimize spoilage), the processing is complete and the sprouts are ready to consume.
Microgreen|broccoli|The conditions that are ideal for properly grown microgreens do not encourage the growth of dangerous pathogens
Microgreen|broccoli|These growing methods would not work for the production of sprouts.
Microgreen|broccoli|However, the potential for food safety issues with microgreens may be increasing due to the number of indoor microgreen growing operations in which excessive seed density, low light intensity, low air circulation, or most commonly, a lack of GAP (good agricultural practices) and GMP (good manufacturing practices) based food safety procedures
Microgreen|broccoli|Certain provisions of the Guidance for Industry
Microgreen|broccoli|Reducing Microbial Food Safety Hazards For Sprouted Seeds  may be beneficial and prudent for growers of microgreens to follow
Microgreen|broccoli|Also, not all plants can be grown as microgreens due to toxicity concerns
Microgreen|broccoli|For instance, nightshade plants (eggplants, tomatoes, potatoes, peppers, etc.) should not be grown as microgreen sprouts, since nightshade sprouts are toxic.
Microgreen|broccoli|Microgreens have a long shelf life if stored and packaged properly
Microgreen|broccoli|Optimal methods of storing and transporting microgreens are currently being studied
Microgreen|broccoli|Commercial microgreens are most often stored in plastic clamshell containers, which do not provide the right balance of oxygen and carbon dioxide for live greens to breathe
Microgreen|broccoli|This is why microgreens are normally sold cut and packaged in a non breathable container
Microgreen|broccoli|When freshly cut the shelf life for microgreens can be several weeks
Microgreen|broccoli|Some growers add a food safe moisture wicking material in the bottom of the container to extend shelf life
Microgreen|broccoli|Moisture control and temperature are the two most important factors when considering the longevity of packaged microgreens and their transport
Microgreen|broccoli|"""After harvesting, microgreens should be kept as cool as possible without damaging the product"
Microgreen|broccoli|Minimizing the time the product is left at room temperature should be a required practice
Microgreen|broccoli|Microgreens should be stored in a clean, refrigerated area at 4°C or less to minimize microbial growth
Microgreen|broccoli|A thermometer should be installed and monitored regularly in the temperature-controlled environment
Microgreen|broccoli|Microgreens should also be stored in a manner that prevents product damage
Microgreen|broccoli|Stacking too many clamshell packages or bags of product on top of each other could cause damage to the product at the bottom of the stacks, which raises the risk of faster deterioration of the final product
Microgreen|broccoli|While shelf life will vary from species to species and variety to variety, most microgreens will have a shelf life of approximately 5 to 10 days with proper handling and storage
Microgreen|broccoli|The high level of care, attention and proper storage put into the product needs to be transferred into the distribution stages
Microgreen|broccoli|Microgreens need to be transported in refrigerated spaces to reduce risk of contamination and microbial growth
Microgreen|broccoli|Although it is up to the end consumer to follow basic food safety requirements, growers should advise customers on the recommended handling and storage of the product when opportunity allows
Microgreen|broccoli|"Using the best practices and proper crop management discussed in this factsheet can give growers the best results for their business goals.""The ARS researchers found that buckwheat microgreens packaged in films with an oxygen transmission rate of 225 cubic centimeters per square inch per day had a fresher appearance and better cell membrane integrity than those packaged in other films tested"
Microgreen|broccoli|Following these steps, the team maintained acceptable buckwheat microgreen quality for more than fourteen days—a significant extension, according to authors
Microgreen|broccoli|This study was published in LWT-Food Science and Technology in 2013.Light-emitting diodes, otherwise known as LEDs, now provide the ability to measure impacts of narrow-band wavelengths of light on seedling physiology
Microgreen|broccoli|The carotenoid zeaxanthin has been hypothesized to be a blue light receptor in plant physiology
Microgreen|broccoli|A study was carried out to measure the impact of short-duration blue light on phytochemical compounds, which impart the nutritional quality of sprouting broccoli microgreens
Microgreen|broccoli|Broccoli microgreens were grown in a controlled environment under LEDs using growing pads
Microgreen|broccoli|Short-duration blue light acted to increase important phytochemical compounds influencing the nutritional value of broccoli microgreens.
Cabbage|cabbage|Cabbage, comprising several cultivars of Brassica oleracea, is a leafy green, red (purple), or white (pale green) biennial plant grown as an annual vegetable crop for its dense-leaved heads
Cabbage|cabbage|It is descended from the wild cabbage (B
Cabbage|cabbage|oleracea var
Cabbage|cabbage|"oleracea), and belongs to the ""cole crops"" or brassicas, meaning it is closely related to broccoli and cauliflower (var"
Cabbage|cabbage|botrytis); Brussels sprouts (var
Cabbage|cabbage|gemmifera); and Savoy cabbage (var
Cabbage|cabbage|sabauda).
Cabbage|cabbage|A cabbage generally weighs between 500 to 1,000 grams (1 to 2 lb)
Cabbage|cabbage|Smooth-leafed, firm-headed green cabbages are the most common, with smooth-leafed purple cabbages and crinkle-leafed savoy cabbages of both colours being rarer
Cabbage|cabbage|Under conditions of long sunny days, such as those found at high northern latitudes in summer, cabbages can grow quite large
Cabbage|cabbage|As of 2012, the heaviest cabbage was 62.71 kilograms (138 lb 4 oz)
Cabbage|cabbage|Cabbage heads are generally picked during the first year of the plant's life cycle, but plants intended for seed are allowed to grow a second year and must be kept separate from other cole crops to prevent cross-pollination
Cabbage|cabbage|Cabbage is prone to several nutrient deficiencies, as well as to multiple pests, and bacterial and fungal diseases.
Cabbage|cabbage|Cabbage was most likely domesticated somewhere in Europe before 1000 BC, although savoys were not developed until the 16th century AD
Cabbage|cabbage|By the Middle Ages, cabbage had become a prominent part of European cuisine
Cabbage|cabbage|They can be prepared many different ways for eating; they can be pickled, fermented (for dishes such as sauerkraut), steamed, stewed, roasted, sautéed, braised, or eaten raw
Cabbage|cabbage|Cabbage is a good source of vitamin K, vitamin C and dietary fiber
Cabbage|cabbage|World production of cabbage and other brassicas for 2018 was 69 million tonnes, and China accounts for 48% of the total.
Cabbage|cabbage|Cabbage (Brassica oleracea or B
Cabbage|cabbage|oleracea var
Cabbage|cabbage|capitata, var
Cabbage|cabbage|tuba, var
Cabbage|cabbage|sabauda or var
Cabbage|cabbage|acephala) is a member of the genus Brassica and the mustard family, Brassicaceae
Cabbage|cabbage|Several other cruciferous vegetables (sometimes known as cole crops) are cultivars of B
Cabbage|cabbage|oleracea, including broccoli, collard greens, brussels sprouts, kohlrabi and sprouting broccoli
Cabbage|cabbage|All of these developed from the wild cabbage B
Cabbage|cabbage|oleracea var
Cabbage|cabbage|oleracea, also called colewort or field cabbage
Cabbage|cabbage|"This original species evolved over thousands of years into those seen today, as selection resulted in cultivars having different characteristics, such as large heads for cabbage, large leaves for kale and thick stems with flower buds for broccoli.The varietal epithet capitata is derived from the Latin word for ""having a head"".""Cabbage"" was originally used to refer to multiple forms of B"
Cabbage|cabbage|oleracea, including those with loose or non-existent heads
Cabbage|cabbage|A related species, Brassica rapa, is commonly named Chinese, napa or celery cabbage, and has many of the same uses
Cabbage|cabbage|It is also a part of common names for several unrelated species
Cabbage|cabbage|These include cabbage bark or cabbage tree (a member of the genus Andira) and cabbage palms, which include several genera of palms such as Mauritia, Roystonea oleracea, Acrocomia and Euterpe oenocarpus.The original family name of brassicas was Cruciferae, which derived from the flower petal pattern thought by medieval Europeans to resemble a crucifix
Cabbage|cabbage|The word brassica derives from bresic, a Celtic word for cabbage
Cabbage|cabbage|"Many European and Asiatic names for cabbage are derived from the Celto-Slavic root cap or kap, meaning ""head"""
Cabbage|cabbage|"The late Middle English word cabbage derives from the word caboche (""head""), from the Picard dialect of Old French"
Cabbage|cabbage|This in turn is a variant of the Old French caboce
Cabbage|cabbage|"Through the centuries, ""cabbage"" and its derivatives have been used as slang for numerous items, occupations and activities"
Cabbage|cabbage|"Cash and tobacco have both been described by the slang ""cabbage"", while ""cabbage-head"" means a fool or stupid person and ""cabbaged"" means to be exhausted or, vulgarly, in a vegetative state."
Cabbage|cabbage|Cabbage seedlings have a thin taproot and cordate (heart-shaped) cotyledons
Cabbage|cabbage|The first leaves produced are ovate (egg-shaped) with a lobed petiole
Cabbage|cabbage|Plants are 40–60 cm (16–24 in) tall in their first year at the mature vegetative stage, and 1.5–2.0 m (4 ft 11 in–6 ft 7 in) tall when flowering in the second year
Cabbage|cabbage|Heads average between 0.5 and 4 kg (1 and 8 lb), with fast-growing, earlier-maturing varieties producing smaller heads
Cabbage|cabbage|Most cabbages have thick, alternating leaves, with margins that range from wavy or lobed to highly dissected; some varieties have a waxy bloom on the leaves
Cabbage|cabbage|Plants have root systems that are fibrous and shallow
Cabbage|cabbage|About 90 percent of the root mass is in the upper 20–30 cm (8–12 in) of soil; some lateral roots can penetrate up to 2 m (6 ft 7 in) deep.The inflorescence is an unbranched and indeterminate terminal raceme measuring 50–100 cm (20–40 in) tall, with flowers that are yellow or white
Cabbage|cabbage|Each flower has four petals set in a perpendicular pattern, as well as four sepals, six stamens, and a superior ovary that is two-celled and contains a single stigma and style
Cabbage|cabbage|Two of the six stamens have shorter filaments
Cabbage|cabbage|The fruit is a silique that opens at maturity through dehiscence to reveal brown or black seeds that are small and round in shape
Cabbage|cabbage|Self-pollination is impossible, and plants are cross-pollinated by insects
Cabbage|cabbage|The initial leaves form a rosette shape comprising 7 to 15 leaves, each measuring 25–35 cm (10–14 in) by 20–30 cm (8–12 in); after this, leaves with shorter petioles develop and heads form through the leaves cupping inward.Many shapes, colors and leaf textures are found in various cultivated varieties of cabbage
Cabbage|cabbage|Leaf types are generally divided between crinkled-leaf, loose-head savoys and smooth-leaf firm-head cabbages, while the color spectrum includes white and a range of greens and purples
Cabbage|cabbage|Oblate, round and pointed shapes are found.Cabbage has been selectively bred for head weight and morphological characteristics, frost hardiness, fast growth and storage ability
Cabbage|cabbage|The appearance of the cabbage head has been given importance in selective breeding, with varieties being chosen for shape, color, firmness and other physical characteristics
Cabbage|cabbage|Breeding objectives are now focused on increasing resistance to various insects and diseases and improving the nutritional content of cabbage
Cabbage|cabbage|Scientific research into the genetic modification of B
Cabbage|cabbage|oleracea crops, including cabbage, has included European Union and United States explorations of greater insect and herbicide resistance.There are several Guinness Book of World Records entries related to cabbage
Cabbage|cabbage|These include the heaviest cabbage, at 62.71 kg (138 lb 4 oz), heaviest red cabbage, at 31.6 kilograms (69 lb 11 oz), longest cabbage roll, at 19.54 m (64 ft 1+1⁄2 in), and the largest cabbage dish, at 2,960 kg (6,526 lb).
Cabbage|cabbage|"Although cabbage has an extensive history, it is difficult to trace its exact origins owing to the many varieties of leafy greens classified as ""brassicas"""
Cabbage|cabbage|A possible wild ancestor of cabbage, Brassica oleracea, originally found in Britain and continental Europe, is tolerant of salt but not encroachment by other plants and consequently inhabits rocky cliffs in cool damp coastal habitats, retaining water and nutrients in its slightly thickened, turgid leaves
Cabbage|cabbage|However, genetic analysis is consistent with feral origin of this population, deriving from plants escaped from field and gardens
Cabbage|cabbage|According to the triangle of U theory of the evolution and relationships between Brassica species, B
Cabbage|cabbage|oleracea and other closely related kale vegetables (cabbages, kale, broccoli, Brussels sprouts, and cauliflower) represent one of three ancestral lines from which all other brassicas originated.Cabbage was probably domesticated later in history than Near Eastern crops such as lentils and summer wheat
Cabbage|cabbage|Because of the wide range of crops developed from the wild B
Cabbage|cabbage|oleracea, multiple broadly contemporaneous domestications of cabbage may have occurred throughout Europe
Cabbage|cabbage|"Nonheading cabbages and kale were probably the first to be domesticated, before 1000 BC, perhaps by the Celts of central and western Europe, although recent linguistic and genetic evidence enforces a Mediterranean origin of cultivated brassicas.While unidentified brassicas were part of the highly conservative unchanging Mesopotamian garden repertory, it is believed that the ancient Egyptians did not cultivate cabbage, which is not native to the Nile valley, though the word shaw't in Papyrus Harris of the time of Ramesses III has been interpreted as ""cabbage"""
Cabbage|cabbage|The ancient Greeks had some varieties of cabbage, as mentioned by Theophrastus, although whether they were more closely related to today's cabbage or to one of the other Brassica crops is unknown
Cabbage|cabbage|The headed cabbage variety was known to the Greeks as krambe and to the Romans as brassica or olus; the open, leafy variety (kale) was known in Greek as raphanos and in Latin as caulis
Cabbage|cabbage|Ptolemaic Egyptians knew the cole crops as gramb, under the influence of Greek krambe, which had been a familiar plant to the Macedonian antecedents of the Ptolemies
Cabbage|cabbage|By early Roman times, Egyptian artisans and children were eating cabbage and turnips among a wide variety of other vegetables and pulses.Chrysippus of Cnidos wrote a treatise on cabbage, which Pliny knew, but it has not survived
Cabbage|cabbage|The Greeks were convinced that cabbages and grapevines were inimical, and that cabbage planted too near the vine would impart its unwelcome odor to the grapes; this Mediterranean sense of antipathy survives today.Brassica was considered by some Romans a table luxury,  although Lucullus considered it unfit for the senatorial table
Cabbage|cabbage|The more traditionalist Cato the Elder, espousing a simple Republican life, ate his cabbage cooked or raw and dressed with vinegar; he said it surpassed all other vegetables, and approvingly distinguished three varieties; he also gave directions for its medicinal use, which extended to the cabbage-eater's urine, in which infants might be rinsed
Cabbage|cabbage|"Pliny the Elder listed seven varieties, including Pompeii cabbage, Cumae cabbage and Sabellian cabbage.According to Pliny, the Pompeii cabbage, which could not stand cold, is ""taller, and has a thick stock near the root, but grows thicker between the leaves, these being scantier and narrower, but their tenderness is a valuable quality"""
Cabbage|cabbage|The Pompeii cabbage was also mentioned by Columella in De Re Rustica
Cabbage|cabbage|Apicius gives several recipes for cauliculi, tender cabbage shoots
Cabbage|cabbage|The Greeks and Romans claimed medicinal usages for their cabbage varieties that included relief from gout, headaches and the symptoms of poisonous mushroom ingestion.The antipathy towards the vine made it seem that eating cabbage would enable one to avoid drunkenness
Cabbage|cabbage|Cabbage continued to figure in the materia medica of antiquity as well as at table
Cabbage|cabbage|in the first century AD Dioscorides mentions two kinds of coleworts with medical uses, the cultivated and the wild, and his opinions continued to be paraphrased in herbals right through the 17th century.
Cabbage|cabbage|"At the end of Antiquity cabbage is mentioned in De observatione ciborum (""On the Observance of Foods"") by Anthimus, a Greek doctor at the court of Theodoric the Great"
Cabbage|cabbage|Cabbage appears among vegetables directed to be cultivated in the Capitulare de villis, composed in 771–800 AD, that guided the governance of the royal estates of Charlemagne.
Cabbage|cabbage|In Britain, the Anglo-Saxons cultivated cawel
Cabbage|cabbage|"When round-headed cabbages appeared in 14th-century England they were called cabaches and caboches, words drawn from Old French and applied at first to refer to the ball of unopened leaves,  the contemporaneous recipe that commences ""Take cabbages and quarter them, and seethe them in good broth"", also suggests the tightly headed cabbage."
Cabbage|cabbage|Manuscript illuminations show the prominence of cabbage in the cuisine of the High Middle Ages,  and cabbage seeds feature among the seed list of purchases for the use of King John II of France when captive in England in 1360, but cabbages were also a familiar staple of the poor
Cabbage|cabbage|"in the lean year of 1420 the ""Bourgeois of Paris"" noted that ""poor people ate no bread, nothing but cabbages and turnips and such dishes, without any bread or salt"""
Cabbage|cabbage|"French naturalist Jean Ruel made what is considered the first explicit mention of head cabbage in his 1536 botanical treatise De Natura Stirpium, referring to it as capucos coles (""head-coles"").In Istanbul, Sultan Selim III penned a tongue-in-cheek ode to cabbage"
Cabbage|cabbage|without cabbage, the halva feast was not complete
Cabbage|cabbage|In India, cabbage was one of several vegetable crops introduced by colonizing traders from Portugal, who established trade routes from the 14th to 17th centuries
Cabbage|cabbage|Carl Peter Thunberg reported that cabbage was not yet known in Japan in 1775.Many cabbage varieties—including some still commonly grown—were introduced in Germany, France, and the Low Countries
Cabbage|cabbage|During the 16th century, German gardeners developed the savoy cabbage
Cabbage|cabbage|During the 17th and 18th centuries, cabbage was a food staple in such countries as Germany, England, Ireland and Russia, and pickled cabbage was frequently eaten
Cabbage|cabbage|Sauerkraut was used by Dutch, Scandinavian and German sailors to prevent scurvy during long ship voyages.Jacques Cartier first brought cabbage to the Americas in 1541–42, and it was probably planted by the early English colonists, despite the lack of written evidence of its existence there until the mid-17th century
Cabbage|cabbage|By the 18th century, it was commonly planted by both colonists and native American Indians
Cabbage|cabbage|Cabbage seeds traveled to Australia in 1788 with the First Fleet, and were planted the same year on Norfolk Island
Cabbage|cabbage|It became a favorite vegetable of Australians by the 1830s and was frequently seen at the Sydney Markets.
Cabbage|cabbage|An traditional and very old, street, open air market
Cabbage|cabbage|Zelný trh (Cabbage market) in Brno, Moravia, Czech republic is named only by cabbage since 1325 (700 year) years.
Cabbage|cabbage|Cabbage is generally grown for its densely leaved heads, produced during the first year of its biennial cycle
Cabbage|cabbage|Plants perform best when grown in well-drained soil in a location that receives full sun
Cabbage|cabbage|Different varieties prefer different soil types, ranging from lighter sand to heavier clay, but all prefer fertile ground with a pH between 6.0 and 6.8
Cabbage|cabbage|For optimal growth, there must be adequate levels of nitrogen in the soil, especially during the early head formation stage, and sufficient phosphorus and potassium during the early stages of expansion of the outer leaves.Temperatures between 4 and 24 °C (39 and 75 °F) prompt the best growth, and extended periods of higher or lower temperatures may result in premature bolting (flowering)
Cabbage|cabbage|Flowering induced by periods of low temperatures (a process called vernalization) only occurs if the plant is past the juvenile period
Cabbage|cabbage|The transition from a juvenile to adult state happens when the stem diameter is about 6 mm (1⁄4 in)
Cabbage|cabbage|Vernalization allows the plant to grow to an adequate size before flowering
Cabbage|cabbage|In certain climates, cabbage can be planted at the beginning of the cold period and survive until a later warm period without being induced to flower, a practice that was common in the eastern US.
Cabbage|cabbage|Plants are generally started in protected locations early in the growing season before being transplanted outside, although some are seeded directly into the ground from which they will be harvested
Cabbage|cabbage|Seedlings typically emerge in about 4–6 days from seeds planted 13 mm (1⁄2 in) deep at a soil temperature between 20 and 30 °C (68 and 86 °F)
Cabbage|cabbage|Growers normally place plants 30 to 61 cm (12 to 24 in) apart
Cabbage|cabbage|"Closer spacing reduces the resources available to each plant (especially the amount of light) and increases the time taken to reach maturity.Some varieties of cabbage have been developed for ornamental use; these are generally called ""flowering cabbage"""
Cabbage|cabbage|They do not produce heads and feature purple or green outer leaves surrounding an inner grouping of smaller leaves in white, red, or pink
Cabbage|cabbage|Early varieties of cabbage take about 70 days from planting to reach maturity, while late varieties take about 120 days.Cabbages are mature when they are firm and solid to the touch
Cabbage|cabbage|They are harvested by cutting the stalk just below the bottom leaves with a blade
Cabbage|cabbage|The outer leaves are trimmed, and any diseased, damaged, or necrotic leaves are removed
Cabbage|cabbage|Delays in harvest can result in the head splitting as a result of expansion of the inner leaves and continued stem growth.When being grown for seed, cabbages must be isolated from other B
Cabbage|cabbage|oleracea subspecies, including the wild varieties, by 0.8 to 1.6 km (1⁄2 to 1 mi) to prevent cross-pollination
Cabbage|cabbage|Other Brassica species, such as B
Cabbage|cabbage|rapa, B
Cabbage|cabbage|juncea, B
Cabbage|cabbage|nigra, B
Cabbage|cabbage|napus and Raphanus sativus, do not readily cross-pollinate.
Cabbage|cabbage|White, also called Dutch – Smooth, pale green leavesSome sources only delineate three cultivars
Cabbage|cabbage|savoy, red and white, with spring greens and green cabbage being subsumed under the last.
Cabbage|cabbage|Due to its high level of nutrient requirements, cabbage is prone to nutrient deficiencies, including boron, calcium, phosphorus and potassium
Cabbage|cabbage|There are several physiological disorders that can affect the postharvest appearance of cabbage
Cabbage|cabbage|Internal tip burn occurs when the margins of inside leaves turn brown, but the outer leaves look normal
Cabbage|cabbage|Necrotic spot is where there are oval sunken spots a few millimeters across that are often grouped around the midrib
Cabbage|cabbage|In pepper spot, tiny black spots occur on the areas between the veins, which can increase during storage.Fungal diseases include wirestem, which causes weak or dying transplants; Fusarium yellows, which result in stunted and twisted plants with yellow leaves; and blackleg (see Leptosphaeria maculans), which leads to sunken areas on stems and gray-brown spotted leaves
Cabbage|cabbage|The fungi Alternaria brassicae and A
Cabbage|cabbage|brassicicola cause dark leaf spots in affected plants
Cabbage|cabbage|They are both seedborne and airborne, and typically propagate from spores in infected plant debris left on the soil surface for up to twelve weeks after harvest
Cabbage|cabbage|"Rhizoctonia solani causes the post-emergence disease wirestem, resulting in killed seedlings (""damping-off""), root rot or stunted growth and smaller heads."
Cabbage|cabbage|One of the most common bacterial diseases to affect cabbage is black rot, caused by  Xanthomonas campestris, which causes chlorotic and necrotic lesions that start at the leaf margins, and wilting of plants
Cabbage|cabbage|Clubroot, caused by the soilborne slime mold-like organism Plasmodiophora brassicae, results in swollen, club-like roots
Cabbage|cabbage|Downy mildew, a parasitic disease caused by the oomycete Peronospora parasitica, produces pale leaves with white, brownish or olive mildew on the lower leaf surfaces; this is often confused with the fungal disease powdery mildew.Pests include root-knot nematodes and cabbage maggots, which produce stunted and wilted plants with yellow leaves; aphids, which induce stunted plants with curled and yellow leaves; harlequin cabbage bugs, which cause white and yellow leaves; thrips, which lead to leaves with white-bronze spots; striped flea beetles, which riddle leaves with small holes; and caterpillars, which leave behind large, ragged holes in leaves
Cabbage|cabbage|"The caterpillar stage of the ""small cabbage white butterfly"" (Pieris rapae), commonly known in the United States as the ""imported cabbage worm"", is a major cabbage pest in most countries.The large white butterfly (Pieris brassicae) is prevalent in eastern European countries"
Cabbage|cabbage|The diamondback moth (Plutella xylostella) and the cabbage moth (Mamestra brassicae) thrive in the higher summer temperatures of continental Europe, where they cause considerable damage to cabbage crops
Cabbage|cabbage|The cabbage looper (Trichoplusia ni) is infamous in North America for its voracious appetite and for producing frass that contaminates plants
Cabbage|cabbage|In India, the diamondback moth has caused losses up to 90 percent in crops that were not treated with insecticide
Cabbage|cabbage|Destructive soil insects include the cabbage root fly (Delia radicum) and the cabbage maggot (Hylemya brassicae), whose larvae can burrow into the part of plant consumed by humans.Planting near other members of the cabbage family, or where these plants have been placed in previous years, can prompt the spread of pests and disease
Cabbage|cabbage|Excessive water and excessive heat can also cause cultivation problems.Factors that contribute to reduced head weight include
Cabbage|cabbage|growth in the compacted soils that result from no-till farming practices, drought, waterlogging, insect and disease incidence, and shading and nutrient stress caused by weeds.
Cabbage|cabbage|In 2018, world production of cabbages (combined with other brassicas) was 69.4 million tonnes, led by China with 48% of the world total (table)
Cabbage|cabbage|Other major producers were India, South Korea, and Russia.
Cabbage|cabbage|Cabbages sold for market are generally smaller, and different varieties are used for those sold immediately upon harvest and those stored before sale
Cabbage|cabbage|Those used for processing, especially sauerkraut, are larger and have a lower percentage of water
Cabbage|cabbage|Both hand and mechanical harvesting are used, and hand-harvesting is generally used for cabbages destined for market sales
Cabbage|cabbage|In commercial-scale operations, hand-harvested cabbages are trimmed, sorted, and packed directly in the field to increase efficiency.Vacuum cooling rapidly refrigerates the vegetable, allowing for earlier shipping and a fresher product
Cabbage|cabbage|Cabbage can be stored the longest at −1 to 2 °C (30 to 36 °F) with a humidity of 90–100 percent; these conditions will result in up to six months of longevity
Cabbage|cabbage|When stored under less ideal conditions, cabbage can still last up to four months.
Cabbage|cabbage|Cabbage consumption varies widely around the world
Cabbage|cabbage|Russia has the highest annual per capita consumption at 20 kg (44 lb), followed by Belgium at 4.7 kg (10 lb 6 oz) and the Netherlands at 4.0 kg (8 lb 13 oz)
Cabbage|cabbage|Americans consume 3.9 kg (8.6 lb) annually per capita.
Cabbage|cabbage|Cabbage is prepared and consumed in many ways
Cabbage|cabbage|The simplest options include eating the vegetable raw or steaming it, though many cuisines pickle, stew, sautée or braise cabbage
Cabbage|cabbage|Pickling is a common way of preserving cabbage, creating dishes such as sauerkraut and kimchi, although kimchi is more often made from Chinese cabbage (B
Cabbage|cabbage|rapa subsp
Cabbage|cabbage|pekinensis)
Cabbage|cabbage|Savoy cabbages are usually used in salads, while smooth-leaf types are utilized for both market sales and processing
Cabbage|cabbage|Bean curd and cabbage is a staple of Chinese cooking, while the British dish bubble and squeak is made primarily with leftover potato and boiled cabbage and eaten with cold meat.In Poland, cabbage is one of the main food crops, and it features prominently in Polish cuisine
Cabbage|cabbage|It is frequently eaten, either cooked or as sauerkraut, as a side dish or as an ingredient in such dishes as bigos (cabbage, sauerkraut, meat, and wild mushrooms, among other ingredients) gołąbki (stuffed cabbage) and pierogi (filled dumplings)
Cabbage|cabbage|Other eastern European countries, such as Hungary and Romania, also have traditional dishes that feature cabbage as a main ingredient
Cabbage|cabbage|In India and Ethiopia, cabbage is often included in spicy salads and braises
Cabbage|cabbage|In the United States, cabbage is used primarily for the production of coleslaw, followed by market use and sauerkraut production.
Cabbage|cabbage|The characteristic flavor of cabbage is caused by glucosinolates, a class of sulfur-containing glucosides
Cabbage|cabbage|Although found throughout the plant, these compounds are concentrated in the highest quantities in the seeds; lesser quantities are found in young vegetative tissue, and they decrease as the tissue ages
Cabbage|cabbage|Cooked cabbage is often criticized for its pungent, unpleasant odor and taste
Cabbage|cabbage|These develop when cabbage is overcooked and hydrogen sulfide gas is produced.
Cabbage|cabbage|Raw cabbage is 92% water, 6% carbohydrates, 1% protein, and contains negligible fat (table)
Cabbage|cabbage|In a 100 gram reference amount, raw cabbage is a rich source of vitamin C and vitamin K, containing 44% and 72%, respectively, of the Daily Value (DV)
Cabbage|cabbage|Cabbage is also a moderate source (10–19% DV) of vitamin B6 and folate, with no other nutrients having significant content per 100-gram serving (table).
Cabbage|cabbage|Basic research on cabbage phytochemicals is ongoing to discern if certain cabbage compounds may affect health or have potential for anti-disease effects, such as sulforaphane and other glucosinolates
Cabbage|cabbage|Studies on cruciferous vegetables, including cabbage, include whether they may lower the risk against colon cancer
Cabbage|cabbage|Cabbage is a source of indole-3-carbinol, a chemical under basic research for its possible properties.
Cabbage|cabbage|In addition to its usual purpose as an edible vegetable, cabbage has been used historically in herbalism
Cabbage|cabbage|The Ancient Greeks recommended consuming the vegetable as a laxative, and used cabbage juice as an antidote for mushroom poisoning, for eye salves, and for liniments for bruises
Cabbage|cabbage|The ancient Roman, Pliny the Elder, described both culinary and medicinal properties of the vegetable
Cabbage|cabbage|Ancient Egyptians ate cooked cabbage at the beginning of meals to reduce the intoxicating effects of wine
Cabbage|cabbage|This traditional usage persisted in European literature until the mid-20th century.The cooling properties of the leaves were used in Britain as a treatment for trench foot in World War I, and as compresses for ulcers and breast abscesses
Cabbage|cabbage|Other medicinal uses recorded in European folk medicine include treatments for rheumatism, sore throat, hoarseness, colic, and melancholy
Cabbage|cabbage|Both mashed cabbage and cabbage juice have been used in poultices to remove boils and treat warts, pneumonia, appendicitis, and ulcers
Cabbage|cabbage|As of 2019, there is no clinical evidence that cabbage has any medicinal properties.
Cabbage|cabbage|Excessive consumption of cabbage may lead to increased intestinal gas which causes bloating and flatulence due to the trisaccharide raffinose, which the human small intestine cannot digest, but is digested by bacteria in the large intestine.Cabbage has been linked to outbreaks of some food-borne illnesses, including Listeria monocytogenes and Clostridium botulinum
Cabbage|cabbage|The latter toxin has been traced to pre-made, packaged coleslaw mixes, while the spores were found on whole cabbages that were otherwise acceptable in appearance
Cabbage|cabbage|Shigella species are able to survive in shredded cabbage
Cabbage|cabbage|Two outbreaks of E
Cabbage|cabbage|coli in the United States have been linked to cabbage consumption
Cabbage|cabbage|Biological risk assessments have concluded that there is the potential for further outbreaks linked to uncooked cabbage, due to contamination at many stages of the growing, harvesting and packaging processes
Cabbage|cabbage|Contaminants from water, humans, animals and soil have the potential to be transferred to cabbage, and from there to the end consumer.Cabbage and other cruciferous vegetables contain small amounts of thiocyanate, a compound associated with goiter formation when iodine intake is deficient.

Radish|radish|The radish (Raphanus raphanistrum subsp
Radish|radish|sativus) is an edible root vegetable of the family Brassicaceae that was domesticated in Asia prior to Roman times.
Radish|radish|Radishes are grown and consumed throughout the world, being mostly eaten raw as a crunchy salad vegetable with a pungent flavor
Radish|radish|There are numerous varieties, varying in size, flavor, color, and length of time they take to mature
Radish|radish|Radishes owe their sharp flavor to the various chemical compounds produced by the plants, including glucosinolate, myrosinase, and isothiocyanate
Radish|radish|They are sometimes grown as companion plants and suffer from few pests and diseases
Radish|radish|They germinate quickly and grow rapidly, common smaller varieties being ready for consumption within a month, while larger daikon varieties take several months
Radish|radish|Being easy to grow and quick to harvest, radishes are often planted by novice gardeners
Radish|radish|Another use of radish is as a cover or catch crop in winter, or as a forage crop
Radish|radish|Some radishes are grown for their seeds; others, such as daikon, may be grown for oil production
Radish|radish|Others are used for sprouting.
Radish|radish|Varieties of radish are now broadly distributed around the world, but almost no archeological records are available to help determine their early history and domestication
Radish|radish|However, scientists have tentatively located the origin of Raphanus sativus in Southeast Asia, as this is the only region where truly wild forms have been discovered
Radish|radish|India, central China, and Central Asia appear to have been secondary centers where differing forms were developed
Radish|radish|Radishes enter the historical record in third century BC
Radish|radish|Greek and Roman agriculturalists of the first century AD gave details of small, large, round, long, mild, and sharp varieties
Radish|radish|The radish seems to have been one of the first European crops introduced to the Americas
Radish|radish|A German botanist reported radishes of 45 kilograms (100 pounds) and roughly 90 centimetres (3 feet) in length in 1544, although the only variety of that size today is the Japanese Sakurajima radish
Radish|radish|The large, mild, and white East Asian form was developed in China, though it is mostly associated in the West with the Japanese daikon, owing to Japanese agricultural development and larger exports.
Radish|radish|Radishes are annual or biennial brassicaceous crops grown for their swollen tap roots which can be globular, tapering, or cylindrical
Radish|radish|The root skin colour ranges from white through pink, red, purple, yellow, and green to black, but the flesh is usually white
Radish|radish|The roots obtain their color from anthocyanins
Radish|radish|Red varieties use the anthocyanin pelargonidin as a pigment, and purple cultivars obtain their color from cyanidin
Radish|radish|Smaller types have a few leaves about 13 cm (5 in) long with round roots up to 2.5 cm (1 in) in diameter or more slender, long roots up to 7 cm (3 in) long
Radish|radish|Both of these are normally eaten raw in salads
Radish|radish|A longer root form, including oriental radishes, daikon or mooli, and winter radishes, grows up to 60 cm (24 in) long with foliage about 60 cm (24 in) high with a spread of 45 cm (18 in)
Radish|radish|The flesh of radishes harvested timely is crisp and sweet, but becomes bitter and tough if the vegetable is left in the ground too long
Radish|radish|Leaves are arranged in a rosette
Radish|radish|They have a lyrate shape, meaning they are divided pinnately with an enlarged terminal lobe and smaller lateral lobes
Radish|radish|The white flowers are borne on a racemose inflorescence
Radish|radish|The fruits are small pods which can be eaten when young.The radish is a diploid species, and has 18 chromosomes (2n=18)
Radish|radish|It is estimated that the radish genome contains between 526 and 574 Mb.
Radish|radish|Radishes are a fast-growing, annual, cool-season crop
Radish|radish|The seed germinates in three to four days in moist conditions with soil temperatures between 18 and 29 °C (65 and 85 °F)
Radish|radish|Best quality roots are obtained under moderate day lengths with air temperatures in the range 10 to 18 °C (50 to 65 °F)
Radish|radish|Under average conditions, the crop matures in 3–4 weeks, but in colder weather, 6–7 weeks may be required.Radishes grow best in full sun in light, sandy loams, with a soil pH 6.5 to 7.0, but for late-season crops, a clayey-loam is ideal
Radish|radish|Soils that bake dry and form a crust in dry weather are unsuitable and can impair germination
Radish|radish|Harvesting periods can be extended by making repeat plantings, spaced a week or two apart
Radish|radish|In warmer climates, radishes are normally planted in the autumn
Radish|radish|The depth at which seeds are planted affects the size of the root, from 1 cm (1⁄2 in) deep recommended for small radishes to 4 cm (1+1⁄2 in) for large radishes
Radish|radish|During the growing period, the crop needs to be thinned and weeds controlled, and irrigation may be required.
Radish|radish|Radishes are a common garden crop in many parts of the world, and the fast harvest cycle makes them particularly suitable for children's gardens
Radish|radish|After harvesting, radishes can be stored without loss of quality for two or three days at room temperature, and about two months at 0 °C (32 °F) with a relative humidity of 90–95%.
Radish|radish|Radishes can be useful as companion plants for many other crops, probably because their pungent odour deters such insect pests as aphids, cucumber beetles, tomato hornworms, squash bugs, and ants
Radish|radish|They can also function as a trap crop, luring insect pests away from the main crop
Radish|radish|Cucumbers and radishes seem to thrive when grown in close association with each other, and radishes also grow well with chervil, lettuce, peas, and nasturtiums
Radish|radish|However, they react adversely to growing in close association with hyssop.
Radish|radish|As a fast-growing plant, diseases are not generally a problem with radishes, but some insect pests can be a nuisance
Radish|radish|"The larvae of flea beetles (Delia radicum) live in the soil, but the adult beetles cause damage to the crop, biting small ""shot holes"" in the leaves, especially of seedlings"
Radish|radish|The swede midge (Contarinia nasturtii) attacks the foliage and growing tip of the plant and causes distortion, multiple (or no) growing tips, and swollen or crinkled leaves and stems
Radish|radish|The larvae of the cabbage root fly sometimes attack the roots
Radish|radish|The foliage droops and becomes discoloured, and small, white maggots tunnel through the root, making it unattractive or inedible.
Radish|radish|'Bunny Tail' is an heirloom variety from Italy, where it is known as Rosso Tondo A Piccola Punta Bianca
Radish|radish|It is slightly oblong, mostly red, with a white tip.
Radish|radish|'Cherry Belle' is a bright red-skinned round variety with a white interior
Radish|radish|It is familiar in North American supermarkets.
Radish|radish|'Sicily Giant' is a large heirloom variety from Sicily
Radish|radish|It can reach up to 5 cm (2 in) in diameter.
Radish|radish|'White Icicle' or 'Icicle' is a white carrot-shaped variety, around 10–12 cm (4–5 in) long, dating back to the 16th century
Radish|radish|It slices easily, and has better than average resistance to pithiness.
Radish|radish|'French Breakfast' is an elongated, red-skinned radish with a white splash at the root end
Radish|radish|It is typically slightly milder than other summer varieties, but is among the quickest to turn pithy.
Radish|radish|'Easter Egg' is not an actual variety, but a mix of varieties with different skin colors, typically including white, pink, red, and purple radishes
Radish|radish|Sold in markets or seed packets under the name, the seed mixes can extend harvesting duration from a single planting, as different varieties may mature at different times.
Radish|radish|'Black Spanish' or 'Black Spanish Round' occur in both round and elongated forms, and are sometimes simply called the black radish (Raphanus sativus L

Radish|radish|It dates in Europe to 1548, and was a common garden variety in England and France during the early 19th century
Radish|radish|It has a rough, black skin with hot-flavored, white flesh, is round or irregularly pear shaped, and grows to around 10 cm (4 in) in diameter.Daikon refers to a wide variety of winter oilseed radishes from Asia
Radish|radish|While the Japanese name daikon has been adopted in English, it is also sometimes called the Japanese radish, Chinese radish, Oriental radish or mooli (in India and South Asia)
Radish|radish|Daikon commonly have elongated white roots, although many varieties of daikon exist
Radish|radish|One well-known variety is 'April Cross', with smooth white roots
Radish|radish|The New York Times describes 'Masato Red' and 'Masato Green' varieties as extremely long, well-suited for fall planting and winter storage
Radish|radish|The Sakurajima radish is a hot-flavored variety which is typically grown to around 10 kg (22 lb), but which can grow to 30 kg (66 lb) when left in the ground.Korean radish, also called mu(무), is a variety of white radish with firm crunchy texture
Radish|radish|Although mu is also a generic term for radishes in Korean (as daikon is a generic term for radishes in Japanese), the word is usually used in its narrow sense, referring to Joseon radish(조선무, Joseonmu)
Radish|radish|In Korean cuisine context, the word Joseon is often used in contrast to Wae, to distinguish Korean varieties from Japanese ones
Radish|radish|The longer, thinner, and waterier Japanese daikon cultivated mainly for danmuji is referred to as Wae radish(왜무, Waemu) in Korea
Radish|radish|Korean radishes are generally shorter, stouter, and sturdier than daikon, and have pale green shade halfway down from the top
Radish|radish|They also have stronger flavour, denser flesh and softer leaves
Radish|radish|The greens of Korean radishes are called mucheong(무청) and used as vegetable in various dishes.
Radish|radish|"The seeds of radishes grow in siliques (widely referred to as ""pods""), following flowering that happens when left to grow past their normal harvesting period"
Radish|radish|The seeds are edible, and are sometimes used as a crunchy, sharp addition to salads
Radish|radish|Some varieties are grown specifically for their seeds or seed pods, rather than their roots
Radish|radish|The rat-tailed radish, an old European variety thought to have come from East Asia centuries ago, has long, thin, curly pods which can exceed 20 cm (8 in) in length
Radish|radish|In the 17th century, the pods were often pickled and served with meat
Radish|radish|The 'München Bier' variety supplies seed pods that are sometimes served raw as an accompaniment to beer in Germany.
Radish|radish|In a 100-gram (3+1⁄2-ounce) reference serving, raw radishes provide 66 kilojoules (16 kilocalories) of food energy and have a moderate amount of vitamin C (18% of Daily Value), with other essential nutrients in low content (table)
Radish|radish|A raw radish is 95% water, 3% carbohydrates, 1% protein, and has negligible fat.
Radish|radish|The most commonly eaten portion is the napiform or fusiform taproot, although the entire plant is edible and the tops can be used as a leaf vegetable
Radish|radish|The seed can also be sprouted and eaten raw in a similar way to a mung bean.The root of the radish is usually eaten raw, although tougher specimens can be steamed
Radish|radish|The raw flesh has a crisp texture and a pungent, peppery flavor, caused by glucosinolates and the enzyme myrosinase, which combine when chewed to form allyl isothiocyanates, also present in mustard, horseradish, and wasabi.Radishes are mostly used in salads, but also appear in many European dishes
Radish|radish|In Mexican cuisine, sliced radishes are used in combination with shredded lettuce as garnish for traditional dishes such as tostadas, sopes, enchiladas and Posole stew.Radish greens are usually discarded, but are edible and nutritious, and can be prepared in a variety of ways
Radish|radish|The leaves are sometimes used in recipes, like potato soup or as a sauteed side dish
Radish|radish|"They are also found blended with fruit juices in some recipes.In Indian cuisine the seed pods are called ""moongra"" or ""mogri"" and can be used in many dishes."
Radish|radish|The seeds of radishes can be pressed to extract radish seed oil
Radish|radish|Wild radish seeds contain up to 48% oil, and while not suitable for human consumption, this oil is a potential source of biofuel
Radish|radish|"The daikon grows well in cool climates and, apart from its industrial use, can be used as a cover crop, grown to increase soil fertility, to scavenge nutrients, suppress weeds, help alleviate soil compaction, and prevent winter erosion of the soil.""Radi"", a spiral-cut radish that is sprinkled with salt and occasionally chives, and eaten with the fingers, is traditionally served with beer at the Bavarian Oktoberfest."
Radish|radish|The daikon varieties of radish are important parts of East, Southeast, and South Asian cuisine
Radish|radish|In Japan and Korea, radish dolls are sometimes made as children's toys
Radish|radish|Daikon is also one of the plants that make up the Japanese Festival of Seven Herbs (Nanakusa no sekku) on the seventh day after the new year.Citizens of Oaxaca, Mexico, celebrate the Night of the Radishes (Noche de los rábanos) on December 23 as a part of Christmas celebrations
Radish|radish|This folk art competition uses a large type of radish up to 50 cm (20 in) long and weighing up to 3 kg (7 lb)
Radish|radish|Great skill and ingenuity are used to carve these into religious and popular figures, buildings, and other objects, and they are displayed in the town square.

Turnip|radish|The turnip or white turnip (Brassica rapa subsp
Turnip|radish|rapa) is a root vegetable commonly grown in temperate climates worldwide for its white, fleshy taproot
Turnip|radish|The word turnip is a compound of turn as in turned/rounded on a lathe and neep, derived from Latin napus, the word for the plant
Turnip|radish|Small, tender varieties are grown for human consumption, while larger varieties are grown as feed for livestock
Turnip|radish|In the north of England, Scotland, Ireland, Cornwall and parts of Canada (Quebec, Newfoundland, Manitoba and the Maritimes), the word turnip (or neep) often refers to rutabaga, also known as swede, a larger, yellow root vegetable in the same genus (Brassica).
Turnip|radish|The most common type of turnip is mostly white-skinned apart from the upper 1 to 6 centimetres (1⁄2 to 2+1⁄2 inches), which protrude above the ground and are purple or red or greenish where the sun has hit
Turnip|radish|This above-ground part develops from stem tissue, but is fused with the root
Turnip|radish|The interior flesh is entirely white
Turnip|radish|The root is roughly globular, from 5–20 cm (2–8 in) in diameter, and lacks side roots
Turnip|radish|Underneath, the taproot (the normal root below the swollen storage root) is thin and 10 cm (4 in) or more in length; it is often trimmed off before the vegetable is sold
Turnip|radish|"The leaves grow directly from the above-ground shoulder of the root, with little or no visible crown or neck (as found in rutabagas).Turnip leaves are sometimes eaten as ""turnip greens"" (""turnip tops"" in the UK), and they resemble mustard greens (to which they are closely related) in flavor"
Turnip|radish|Turnip greens are a common side dish in southeastern U.S
Turnip|radish|cooking, primarily during late Fall and Winter
Turnip|radish|Smaller leaves are preferred, but the bitter taste of larger leaves can be reduced by pouring off the water from the initial boiling and replacing it with fresh water
Turnip|radish|Varieties of turnip grown specifically for their leaves resemble mustard greens and have small or no storage roots
Turnip|radish|These include rapini (broccoli rabe), bok choy, and Chinese cabbage
Turnip|radish|Similar to raw cabbage or radish, turnip leaves and roots have a pungent flavor that becomes milder after cooking.Turnip roots weigh up to 1 kilogram (2 pounds 3 ounces), although they are usually harvested when smaller
Turnip|radish|Size is partly a function of variety and partly a function of the length of time the turnip has grown
Turnip|radish|Most very small turnips (also called baby turnips) are specialty varieties
Turnip|radish|These are only available when freshly harvested and do not keep well
Turnip|radish|Most baby turnips can be eaten whole, including their leaves
Turnip|radish|Baby turnips are sold in yellow-, orange-, and red-fleshed varieties, as well as white-fleshed
Turnip|radish|Their flavor is mild, so they can be eaten raw in salads like radishes and other vegetables.
Turnip|radish|"Boiled green leaves of the turnip top (""turnip greens"") provide 84 kilojoules (20 kilocalories) of food energy in a reference serving of 100 grams (3+1⁄2 oz), and are 93% water, 4% carbohydrates, and 1% protein, with negligible fat (table)"
Turnip|radish|The boiled greens are a rich source (more than 20% of the Daily Value, DV) particularly of vitamin K (350% DV), with vitamin A, vitamin C, and folate also in significant content (30% DV or greater, table)
Turnip|radish|Boiled turnip greens also contain substantial lutein (8440 micrograms per 100 g).
Turnip|radish|In a 100-gram reference amount, boiled turnip root supplies 92 kJ (22 kcal), with only vitamin C in a moderate amount (14% DV)
Turnip|radish|Other micronutrients in boiled turnip are in low or negligible content (table)
Turnip|radish|Boiled turnip is 94% water, 5% carbohydrates, and 1% protein, with negligible fat.
Turnip|radish|Wild forms of the turnip and its relatives, the mustards and radishes, are found over western Asia and Europe
Turnip|radish|Starting as early as 2000 BC, related oilseed subspecies of Brassica rapa like oleifera may have been domesticated several times from the Mediterranean to India, though these are not the same turnips cultivated for its roots
Turnip|radish|Furthermore, estimates of domestication dates are limited to linguistic analyses of plant names.Edible turnips were possibly first cultivated in northern Europe, and were an important food in the Hellenistic and Roman world
Turnip|radish|The turnip eventually spread east to China, and reached Japan by 700 AD.Turnips were an important crop in the cuisine of Antebellum America
Turnip|radish|They were grown for their greens as well the roots and could yield edible greens within a few weeks of planting, making them a staple of new plantations still in the process of becoming productive
Turnip|radish|They could be planted as late as the fall and still provide newly arrived settlers with a source of food
Turnip|radish|"The typical southern way of cooking turnip greens was to boil them with a large chunk of ""bacon"""
Turnip|radish|The broth obtained from this process was known as pot likker and was served with crumbled corn pone, often made from coarse meal when little else was available along the antebellum frontier.
Turnip|radish|The 1881 American Household Cyclopedia advises that turnips can be grown in fields that have been harrowed, ploughed, and planted with turnip seed
Turnip|radish|It recommends planting in late May or June and weeding and thinning with a hoe throughout the summer.As a root crop, turnips grow best in cool weather; hot temperatures cause the roots to become woody and bad-tasting
Turnip|radish|They are typically planted in the spring in cold-weather climates (such as the northern US and Canada) where the growing season is only 3–4 months
Turnip|radish|In temperate climates (ones with a growing season of 5–6 months), turnips may also be planted in late summer for a second fall crop
Turnip|radish|In warm-weather climates (7 or more month growing season), they are planted in the fall
Turnip|radish|55–60 days is the average time from planting to harvest.Turnips are a biennial plant, taking two years from germination to reproduction
Turnip|radish|The root spends the first year growing and storing nutrients, and the second year flowers, produces seeds, and dies
Turnip|radish|The flowers of the turnip are tall and yellow, with the seeds forming in pea-like pods
Turnip|radish|In areas with less than seven-month growing seasons, temperatures are too cold for the roots to survive the winter
Turnip|radish|To produce seeds,  pulling the turnips and storing them over winter is necessary, taking care not to damage the leaves
Turnip|radish|During the spring, they may be set back in the ground to complete their lifecycle.
Turnip|radish|"In England around 1700, Charles ""Turnip"" Townshend promoted the use of turnips in a four-year crop-rotation system that enabled year-round livestock feeding"
Turnip|radish|In most of England, the smaller white vegetables are called turnips, while the larger yellow ones are referred to as swedes
Turnip|radish|In the United States, turnips are the same, but swedes are usually called rutabagas.
Turnip|radish|The turnip is an old vegetable charge in heraldry
Turnip|radish|It was used by Leonhard von Keutschach, prince-archbishop of Salzburg
Turnip|radish|The turnip is still the heart shield in the arms of Keutschach am See.The arms of the former municipality of Kiikala, Finland, were Gules, a turnip Or.

Carrot|carrot|The carrot (Daucus carota subsp
Carrot|carrot|sativus) is a root vegetable, typically orange in color, though purple, black, red, white, and yellow cultivars exist, all of which are domesticated forms of the wild carrot, Daucus carota, native to Europe and Southwestern Asia
Carrot|carrot|The plant probably originated in Persia and was originally cultivated for its leaves and seeds
Carrot|carrot|The most commonly eaten part of the plant is the taproot, although the stems and leaves are also eaten
Carrot|carrot|The domestic carrot has been selectively bred for its greatly enlarged, more palatable, less woody-textured taproot.
Carrot|carrot|The carrot is a biennial plant in the umbellifer family, Apiaceae
Carrot|carrot|At first, it grows a rosette of leaves while building up the enlarged taproot
Carrot|carrot|Fast-growing cultivars mature within three months (90 days) of sowing the seed, while slower-maturing cultivars need a month longer (120 days)
Carrot|carrot|The roots contain high quantities of alpha- and beta-carotene, and are a good source of vitamin K and vitamin B6.
Carrot|carrot|The United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) reports that world production of carrots and turnips (these plants are combined by the FAO) for 2018 was 40 million tonnes, with 45% of the world total grown in China
Carrot|carrot|Carrots are widely used in many cuisines, especially in the preparation of salads, and carrot salads are a tradition in many regional cuisines.
Carrot|carrot|The word is first recorded in English circa 1530 and was borrowed from Middle French carotte, itself from Late Latin carōta, from ancient Greek καρωτόν karōtón), originally from the Proto-Indo-European root *ker- ('horn'), due to its horn-like shape
Carrot|carrot|In Old English, carrots (typically white at the time) were not clearly distinguished from parsnips
Carrot|carrot|the two were collectively called moru or more (from Proto-Indo-European *mork- 'edible root', cf
Carrot|carrot|German Möhre or Russian морковь (morkov)).Various languages still use the same word for carrot as they do for root; e.g
Carrot|carrot|Dutch wortel.
Carrot|carrot|Both written history and molecular genetic studies indicate that the domestic carrot has a single origin in Central Asia
Carrot|carrot|Its wild ancestors probably originated in Persia (regions of which are now Iran and Afghanistan), which remains the centre of diversity for the wild carrot Daucus carota
Carrot|carrot|A naturally occurring subspecies of the wild carrot was presumably bred selectively over the centuries to reduce bitterness, increase sweetness and minimise the woody core; this process produced the familiar garden vegetable.When they were first cultivated, carrots were grown for their aromatic leaves and seeds rather than their roots
Carrot|carrot|Carrot seeds have been found in Switzerland and Southern Germany dating back to 2000–3000 BC
Carrot|carrot|Some close relatives of the carrot are still grown for their leaves and seeds, such as parsley, cilantro, coriander, fennel, anise, dill and cumin
Carrot|carrot|The first mention of the root in classical sources is from the 1st century AD; the Romans ate a root vegetable called pastinaca, which may have been either the carrot or the closely related parsnip.The plant is depicted and described in the Eastern Roman Juliana Anicia Codex, a 6th-century AD Constantinopolitan copy of the Greek physician Dioscorides' 1st-century pharmacopoeia of herbs and medicines, De Materia Medica
Carrot|carrot|"Three different types of carrots are depicted, and the text states that ""the root can be cooked and eaten"""
Carrot|carrot|Another copy of this work, Codex Neapolitanes from late 6th or early 7th century, has basically the same illustrations but with roots in purple.The plant was introduced into Spain by the Moors in the 8th century
Carrot|carrot|In the 10th century, roots from West Asia, India and Europe were purple
Carrot|carrot|The modern carrot originated in Afghanistan at about this time
Carrot|carrot|The 11th-century Jewish scholar Simeon Seth describes both red and yellow carrots, as does the 12th-century Arab-Andalusian agriculturist, Ibn al-'Awwam
Carrot|carrot|Cultivated carrots appeared in China in the 12th century, and in Japan in the 16th or 17th century.There are many claims that Dutch growers created orange carrots in the 17th century to honor the Dutch flag at the time and William of Orange
Carrot|carrot|Other authorities argue these claims lack convincing evidence
Carrot|carrot|Modern carrots were described at about this time by the English antiquary John Aubrey (1626–1697)
Carrot|carrot|"""Carrots were first sown at Beckington in Somersetshire"
Carrot|carrot|"Some very old Man there [in 1668] did remember their first bringing hither."" European settlers introduced the carrot to colonial America in the 17th century.Outwardly purple carrots, still orange on the inside, were sold in British stores beginning in 2002."
Carrot|carrot|Daucus carota is a biennial plant
Carrot|carrot|In the first year, its rosette of leaves produces large amounts of sugars, which are stored in the taproot to provide energy for the plant to flower in the second year.
Carrot|carrot|Soon after germination, carrot seedlings show a distinct demarcation between taproot and stem
Carrot|carrot|the stem is thicker and lacks lateral roots
Carrot|carrot|At the upper end of the stem is the seed leaf
Carrot|carrot|The first true leaf appears about 10–15 days after germination
Carrot|carrot|Subsequent leaves are alternate (with a single leaf attached to a node), spirally arranged, and pinnately compound, with leaf bases sheathing the stem
Carrot|carrot|As the plant grows, the bases of the seed leaves, near the taproot, are pushed apart
Carrot|carrot|The stem, located just above the ground, is compressed and the internodes are not distinct
Carrot|carrot|When the seed stalk elongates for flowering, the tip of the stem narrows and becomes pointed, and the stem extends upward to become a highly branched inflorescence up to 60–200 cm (20–80 in) tall.Most of the taproot consists of a pulpy outer cortex (phloem) and an inner core (xylem)
Carrot|carrot|High-quality carrots have a large proportion of cortex compared to core
Carrot|carrot|Although a completely xylem-free carrot is not possible, some cultivars have small and deeply pigmented cores; the taproot can appear to lack a core when the colour of the cortex and core are similar in intensity
Carrot|carrot|Taproots are typically long and conical, although cylindrical and nearly-spherical cultivars are available
Carrot|carrot|The root diameter can range from 1 cm (3⁄8 in) to as much as 10 cm (4 in) at the widest part
Carrot|carrot|The root length ranges from 5 to 50 cm (2 to 20 in), although most are between 10 and 25 cm (4 and 10 in).
Carrot|carrot|Flower development begins when the flat meristem changes from producing leaves to an uplifted, conical meristem capable of producing stem elongation and a cluster of flowers
Carrot|carrot|The cluster is a compound umbel, and each umbel contains several smaller umbels (umbellets)
Carrot|carrot|The first (primary) umbel occurs at the end of the main floral stem; smaller secondary umbels grow from the main branch, and these further branch into third, fourth, and even later-flowering umbels.A large, primary umbel can contain up to 50 umbellets, each of which may have as many as 50 flowers; subsequent umbels have fewer flowers
Carrot|carrot|Individual flowers are small and white, sometimes with a light green or yellow tint
Carrot|carrot|They consist of five petals, five stamens, and an entire calyx
Carrot|carrot|The stamens usually split and fall off before the stigma becomes receptive to receive pollen
Carrot|carrot|The stamens of the brown, male, sterile flowers degenerate and shrivel before the flower fully opens
Carrot|carrot|In the other type of male sterile flower, the stamens are replaced by petals, and these petals do not fall off
Carrot|carrot|A nectar-containing disc is present on the upper surface of the carpels.
Carrot|carrot|Flowers change sex in their development, so the stamens release their pollen before the stigma of the same flower is receptive
Carrot|carrot|The arrangement is centripetal, meaning the oldest flowers are near the edge and the youngest flowers are in the center
Carrot|carrot|Flowers usually first open at the outer edge of the primary umbel, followed about a week later on the secondary umbels, and then in subsequent weeks in higher-order umbels.The usual flowering period of individual umbels is 7 to 10 days, so a plant can be in the process of flowering for 30–50 days
Carrot|carrot|The distinctive umbels and floral nectaries attract pollinating insects
Carrot|carrot|After fertilization and as seeds develop, the outer umbellets of an umbel bend inward causing the umbel shape to change from slightly convex or fairly flat to concave, and when cupped it resembles a bird's nest.
Carrot|carrot|The fruit that develops is a schizocarp consisting of two mericarps; each mericarp is a true seed
Carrot|carrot|The paired mericarps are easily separated when they are dry
Carrot|carrot|Premature separation (shattering) before harvest is undesirable because it can result in seed loss
Carrot|carrot|Mature seeds are flattened on the commissural side that faced the septum of the ovary
Carrot|carrot|The flattened side has five longitudinal ribs
Carrot|carrot|The bristly hairs that protrude from some ribs are usually removed by abrasion during milling and cleaning
Carrot|carrot|Seeds also contain oil ducts and canals
Carrot|carrot|Seeds vary somewhat in size, ranging from less than 500 to more than 1000 seeds per gram.The carrot is a diploid species, and has nine relatively short, uniform-length chromosomes (2n=18)
Carrot|carrot|The genome size is estimated to be 473 mega base pairs, which is four times larger than Arabidopsis thaliana, one-fifth the size of the maize genome, and about the same size as the rice genome.
Carrot|carrot|Polyacetylenes can be found in Apiaceae vegetables like carrots where they show cytotoxic activities
Carrot|carrot|Falcarinol and falcarindiol (cis-heptadeca-1,9-diene-4,6-diyne-3,8-diol) are such compounds
Carrot|carrot|This latter compound shows antifungal activity towards Mycocentrospora acerina and Cladosporium cladosporioides
Carrot|carrot|Falcarindiol is the main compound responsible for bitterness in carrots.Other compounds such as pyrrolidine (present in the leaves), 6-hydroxymellein, 6-methoxymellein, eugenin, 2,4,5-trimethoxybenzaldehyde (gazarin) or (Z)-3-acetoxy-heptadeca-1,9-diene-4,6-diin-8-ol (falcarindiol 3-acetate) can also be found in carrot.
Carrot|carrot|Carrots are grown from seed and can take up to four months (120 days) to mature, but most cultivars mature within 70 to 80 days under the right conditions
Carrot|carrot|They grow best in full sun but tolerate some shade
Carrot|carrot|The optimum temperature is 16 to 21 °C (61 to 70 °F)
Carrot|carrot|The ideal soil is deep, loose and well-drained, sandy or loamy, with a pH of 6.3 to 6.8.Fertilizer should be applied according to soil type because the crop requires low levels of nitrogen, moderate phosphate and high potash
Carrot|carrot|Rich or rocky soils should be avoided, as these will cause the roots to become hairy and/or misshapen
Carrot|carrot|Irrigation is applied when needed to keep the soil moist
Carrot|carrot|After sprouting, the crop is eventually thinned to a spacing of 8 to 10 cm (3 to 4 in) and weeded to prevent competition beneath the soil.
Carrot|carrot|There are several diseases that can reduce the yield and market value of carrots
Carrot|carrot|The most devastating carrot disease is Alternaria leaf blight, which has been known to eradicate entire crops
Carrot|carrot|A bacterial leaf blight caused by Xanthomonas campestris can also be destructive in warm, humid areas
Carrot|carrot|Root knot nematodes (Meloidogyne species) can cause stubby or forked roots, or galls
Carrot|carrot|Cavity spot, caused by the oomycetes Pythium violae and Pythium sulcatum, results in irregularly shaped, depressed lesions on the taproots.Physical damage can also reduce the value of carrot crops
Carrot|carrot|The two main forms of damage are splitting, whereby a longitudinal crack develops during growth that can be a few centimetres to the entire length of the root, and breaking, which occurs postharvest
Carrot|carrot|These disorders can affect over 30% of commercial crops
Carrot|carrot|Factors associated with high levels of splitting include wide plant spacing, early sowing, lengthy growth durations, and genotype.
Carrot|carrot|Carrots benefit from strongly scented companion plants
Carrot|carrot|The pungent odour of onions, leeks and chives help repel the carrot root fly, and other vegetables that team well with carrots include lettuce, tomatoes and radishes, as well as the herbs rosemary and sage
Carrot|carrot|Carrots thrive in the presence of caraway, coriander, chamomile, marigold and Swan River daisy
Carrot|carrot|They can also be good companions for other plants; if left to flower, the carrot, like any umbellifer, attracts predatory wasps that kill many garden pests.
Carrot|carrot|Carrot cultivars can be grouped into two broad classes, eastern carrots and western carrots
Carrot|carrot|"A number of novelty cultivars have been bred for particular characteristics.""Eastern"" (a European and American continent reference) carrots were domesticated in Persia (probably in the lands of modern-day Iran and Afghanistan within West Asia) during the 10th century, or possibly earlier"
Carrot|carrot|"Specimens of the ""eastern"" carrot that survive to the present day are commonly purple or yellow, and often have branched roots"
Carrot|carrot|The purple colour common in these carrots comes from anthocyanin pigments.The western carrot emerged in the Netherlands in the 17th century
Carrot|carrot|There is a popular belief that its orange colour making it popular in those countries as an emblem of the House of Orange and the struggle for Dutch independence, although there is little evidence for this
Carrot|carrot|The orange colour results from abundant carotenes in these cultivars.
Carrot|carrot|Western carrot cultivars are commonly classified by their root shape
Carrot|carrot|The four general types are:
Carrot|carrot|Chantenay carrots
Carrot|carrot|Although the roots are shorter than other cultivars, they have vigorous foliage and greater girth, being broad in the shoulders and tapering towards a blunt, rounded tip
Carrot|carrot|They store well, have a pale-coloured core and are mostly used for processing
Carrot|carrot|Cultivars include 'Carson Hybrid' and 'Red Cored Chantenay'.
Carrot|carrot|Danvers carrots
Carrot|carrot|These have strong foliage and the roots are longer than Chantenay types, and they have a conical shape with a well-defined shoulder, tapering to a point
Carrot|carrot|They are somewhat shorter than Imperator cultivars, but more tolerant of heavy soil conditions
Carrot|carrot|Danvers cultivars store well and are used both fresh and for processing
Carrot|carrot|They were developed in 1871 in Danvers, Massachusetts
Carrot|carrot|Cultivars include 'Danvers Half Long' and 'Danvers 126'.
Carrot|carrot|Imperator carrots
Carrot|carrot|This cultivar has vigorous foliage, is of high sugar content, and has long and slender roots, tapering to a pointed tip
Carrot|carrot|Imperator types are the most widely cultivated by commercial growers
Carrot|carrot|Cultivars include 'Imperator 58' and 'Sugarsnax Hybrid'.
Carrot|carrot|Nantes carrots
Carrot|carrot|These have sparse foliage, are cylindrical, short with a more blunt tip than Imperator types, and attain high yields in a range of conditions
Carrot|carrot|The skin is easily damaged and the core is deeply pigmented
Carrot|carrot|They are brittle, high in sugar and store less well than other types
Carrot|carrot|Cultivars include 'Nelson Hybrid', 'Scarlet Nantes' and 'Sweetness Hybrid'.Carrot breeding programs have developed new cultivars to have dense amounts of chemically-stable acylated pigments, such as anthocyanins, which enrich carrot color based on the density and types of anthocyanin to produce different carrot colors
Carrot|carrot|One particular cultivar lacks the usual orange pigment due to carotene, owing its white colour to a recessive gene for tocopherol (vitamin E), but this cultivar and wild carrots do not provide nutritionally significant amounts of vitamin E.
Carrot|carrot|In 2018, world production of carrots (combined with turnips) was 40 million tonnes, with China producing 45% of the world total (table)
Carrot|carrot|Other major producers were the United States, Uzbekistan, and Russia.
Carrot|carrot|Carrots can be stored for several months in the refrigerator or over winter in a moist, cool place
Carrot|carrot|For long term storage, unwashed carrots can be placed in a bucket between layers of sand, a 50/50 mix of sand and wood shavings, or in soil
Carrot|carrot|A temperature range of 0 to 4 °C (32 to 40 °F) and 98% humidity is best.
Carrot|carrot|Carrots can be eaten in a variety of ways
Carrot|carrot|Only 3 percent of the β-carotene in raw carrots is released during digestion
Carrot|carrot|this can be improved to 39% by pulping, cooking and adding cooking oil
Carrot|carrot|Alternatively they may be chopped and boiled, fried or steamed, and cooked in soups and stews, as well as baby and pet foods
Carrot|carrot|A well-known dish is carrots julienne
Carrot|carrot|Together with onion and celery, carrots are one of the primary vegetables used in a mirepoix to make various broths.The greens are edible as a leaf vegetable, but are rarely eaten by humans; some sources suggest that the greens contain toxic alkaloids
Carrot|carrot|When used for this purpose, they are harvested young in high-density plantings, before significant root development, and typically used stir-fried, or in salads
Carrot|carrot|Some people are allergic to carrots
Carrot|carrot|In a 2010 study on the prevalence of food allergies in Europe, 3.6 percent of young adults showed some degree of sensitivity to carrots
Carrot|carrot|Because the major carrot allergen, the protein Dauc c 1.0104, is cross-reactive with homologues in birch pollen (Bet v 1) and mugwort pollen (Art v 1), most carrot allergy sufferers are also allergic to pollen from these plants.In India carrots are used in a variety of ways, as salads or as vegetables added to spicy rice or dal dishes
Carrot|carrot|A popular variation in north India is the Gajar Ka Halwa carrot dessert, which has carrots grated and cooked in milk until the whole mixture is solid, after which nuts and butter are added
Carrot|carrot|Carrot salads are usually made with grated carrots with a seasoning of mustard seeds and green chillies popped in hot oil
Carrot|carrot|Carrots can also be cut in thin strips and added to rice, can form part of a dish of mixed roast vegetables or can be blended with tamarind to make chutney.Since the late 1980s, baby carrots or mini-carrots (carrots that have been peeled and cut into uniform cylinders) have been a popular ready-to-eat snack food available in many supermarkets
Carrot|carrot|Carrots are puréed and used as baby food, dehydrated to make chips, flakes, and powder, and thinly sliced and deep-fried, like potato chips.The sweetness of carrots allows the vegetable to be used in some fruit-like roles
Carrot|carrot|Grated carrots are used in carrot cakes, as well as carrot puddings, an English dish thought to have originated in the early 19th century
Carrot|carrot|Carrots can also be used alone or blended with fruits in jams and preserves
Carrot|carrot|Carrot juice is also widely marketed, especially as a health drink, either stand-alone or blended with juices extracted from fruits and other vegetables.Highly excessive consumption over a period of time can result in carotenemia, a yellow-orange discoloration of the skin caused by a build up of carotenoids.
Carrot|carrot|Raw carrots are 88% water, 9% carbohydrates, 0.9% protein, 2.8% dietary fiber, 1% ash and 0.2% fat
Carrot|carrot|Carrot dietary fiber comprises mostly cellulose, with smaller proportions of hemicellulose, lignin and starch
Carrot|carrot|Free sugars in carrot include sucrose, glucose, and fructose.The carrot gets its characteristic, bright orange colour from β-carotene, and lesser amounts of α-carotene, γ-carotene, lutein, and zeaxanthin
Carrot|carrot|α- and β-carotenes are partly metabolized into vitamin A, providing more than 100% of the Daily Value (DV) per 100 g serving of carrots (right table)
Carrot|carrot|Carrots are also a good source of vitamin K (13% DV) and vitamin B6 (11% DV), but otherwise have modest content of other essential nutrients (table).
Carrot|carrot|The provitamin A beta-carotene from carrots does not actually help people to see in the dark unless they suffer from vitamin A deficiency
Carrot|carrot|This myth was propaganda used by the Royal Air Force during the Second World War to explain why their pilots had improved success during night air battles, but was actually used to disguise advances in radar technology and the use of red lights on instrument panels.Nevertheless, the consumption of carrots was advocated in Britain at the time as part of a Dig for Victory campaign
Carrot|carrot|A radio programme called The Kitchen Front encouraged people to grow, store and use carrots in various novel ways, including making carrot jam and Woolton pie, named after the Lord Woolton, the Minister for Food
Carrot|carrot|The British public during WWII generally believed that eating carrots would help them see better at night and in 1942 there was a 100,000-ton surplus of carrots from the extra production.
Carrot and stick|carrot|"The phrase ""carrot and stick"" is a metaphor for the use of a combination of reward and punishment to induce a desired behaviour.In politics, ""carrot or stick"" sometimes refers to the realist concept of soft and hard power"
Carrot and stick|carrot|The carrot in this context could be the promise of economic or diplomatic aid between nations, while the stick might be the threat of military action.
Carrot and stick|carrot|"The earliest English-language references to the ""carrot and stick"" come from authors in the mid-1800s who in turn wrote in reference to a ""caricature"" or cartoon of the time that depicted a race between donkey riders, with the losing jockey using the strategy of beating his steed with ""blackthorn twigs"" to urge it forward, while the winner of the race sits in his saddle relaxing and holding the butt end of his baited stick"
Carrot and stick|carrot|In fact, in some oral traditions, turnips were used instead of carrots as the donkey's temptation.
Carrot and stick|carrot|Decades later, the idea appeared in a letter from Winston Churchill, dated July 6, 1938
Carrot and stick|carrot|"""Thus, by every device from the stick to the carrot, the emaciated Austrian donkey is made to pull the Nazi barrow up an ever-steepening hill.""The Southern Hemisphere caught up in 1947 and 1948 amid Australian newspaper commentary about the need to stimulate productivity following World War II.The earliest uses of the idiom in widely available U.S"
Carrot and stick|carrot|periodicals were in The Economist's December 11, 1948 issue and in a Daily Republic newspaper article that same year that discussed Russia's economy.In the German language, the idiom translates as sugar bread and whip.
Carrot and stick|carrot|"In the years leading up to World War II and during the war itself, Joseph Stalin applied the ""carrot or stick"" principle among the nations of the Soviet Sphere of Influence in order to establish tighter control over them"
Carrot and stick|carrot|"For example, in 1934, Stalin reversed his decision to attack the socialists of the region, instead allowing them to join the ""People's Front Against Fascism and War."" Despite this alliance's limited success when it came to strategies against the fascism of Nazi Germany, Stalin had effectively replaced the ""stick"" of aggression that he had been using against the socialists with the ""carrot"" of a better deal for them"
Carrot and stick|carrot|membership in a more sweeping system of Popular Fronts against the Axis.
Carrot and stick|carrot|Stalin's use of reward and punishment, as described above, has not been unique in the world arena
Carrot and stick|carrot|A casual survey of international news confirms that the tactic is still in common use today, by people in power up to and including the presidents of the United States and NATO
Carrot and stick|carrot|The carrot and stick as metaphor could be applied to the conduct of the Chinese during the Ming treasure voyages in the 15th century
Carrot and stick|carrot|The carrot was access to Chinese goods through trade opportunity and the stick was the overwhelming naval power that the Ming Chinese expeditionary fleet could bring upon recalcitrant rulers
Carrot and stick|carrot|Diplomatic relationships were based on a mutually beneficial maritime commerce and a visible presence of a Chinese militaristic naval force in foreign waters
Carrot and stick|carrot|The Chinese naval superiority was a crucial factor in this interaction, namely because it was inadvisable to risk punitive action from the Chinese fleet
Carrot and stick|carrot|Meanwhile, the worthwhile and profitable nature of the Ming treasure voyages for foreign countries was a persuading factor to comply.

Carrot fly|carrot|The carrot fly (Chamaepsila rosae) is a pest of gardens and farms, and mainly affects the crop of carrots, but can also attack parsnips, parsley and celery
Carrot fly|carrot|It is a member of the family Psilidae (order Diptera).
Carrot fly|carrot|Crop damage is caused by the creamy-yellow larvae (maggots) feeding on the outer layers of the carrot root
Carrot fly|carrot|In autumn, they may penetrate further into the root
Carrot fly|carrot|The legless larvae are up to 10 mm in length.
Carrot fly|carrot|Foliage becomes wilted and discoloured
Carrot fly|carrot|Leaves turn rusty red to scarlet with some yellowing
Carrot fly|carrot|Rusty-brown tunnels are seen under the outer skin of mature roots.
Carrot fly|carrot|The flies lay their eggs around the developing carrots; the larvae, once hatched, burrow into the root
Carrot fly|carrot|As female carrot flies are very low flying, the best method of prevention is to erect a barrier around the crop at least 2 feet (60 cm) high
Carrot fly|carrot|Alternatively horticultural fleece may be used as a floating mulch to cover the crop
Carrot fly|carrot|Because the carrot fly is attracted to host plants by odor, masking the smell of the host plant by planting odoriferous companion crops such as onions, chives, and garlic can successfully deter attack
Carrot fly|carrot|Intermixing of crops can also be a fruitful way to confuse and avoid carrot fly attack
Carrot fly|carrot|Some plants such as rosemary, sage, and marigold are also used to deter the carrot fly
Carrot fly|carrot|Newer varieties of carrot which claim to be resistant to carrot fly (e.g
Carrot fly|carrot|"""Flyaway"") may be used."
Carrot fly|carrot|Another method of control is to use heavier, fine plastic mesh available from garden centers and over the internet made specially for the purpose
Carrot fly|carrot|"This can be in the form of a surrounding wall or a complete ""cage"""
Carrot fly|carrot|Some form of support framework is necessary to prevent the netting from flattening the foliage
Carrot fly|carrot|Also the bottom of the netting needs to be in close contact or buried in the soil as it is believed that the eggs are laid on bare soil
Carrot fly|carrot|When the maggots hatch they then crawl towards the carrots so a soil level barrier is necessary.
Carrot fly|carrot|The original species name of Musca rosae (Fabricius in Entomologia systematica emendata et aucta (1794)) was originally occupied by Musca rosae (De Geer 1776), which was itself a synonym for the hoverfly species Musca pyrastri Linnaeus, 1758 (now Scaeva pyrastri)
Carrot fly|carrot|The new name of Chamaepsila hennigi was proposed for the Carrot fly by Thompson & Pont in 1994
Carrot fly|carrot|As the name rosae Fabricius was well known for this major crop pest, applications were made to the International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature for suppression of the name rosae of De Geer and the conservation of rosae of Fabricius
Carrot fly|carrot|In 2006 they ruled under their plenary powers that rosae Fabricius, 1794 was not to be regarded as invalid by reason of being a junior primary homonym of Musca rosae De Geer, 1776.
Carrot harvester|carrot|A Carrot Harvester  is an agricultural machine for harvesting carrots
Carrot harvester|carrot|Carrot harvesters are either top lifters or share lifters and may be tractor mounted, trailed behind a tractor or self-propelled
Carrot harvester|carrot|The machine typically harvests between one and six rows of carrots at once.
Carrot harvester|carrot|Top lifters use rubber belts to grab the green tops of the carrot plant and pull them from the soil
Carrot harvester|carrot|A share pushes under the carrot root and loosens the plant.
Carrot harvester|carrot|A share lifter uses a share to get the carrots out of the ground from underneath
Carrot harvester|carrot|The machine must be preceded by a topper to cut the green tops off the carrot plants
Carrot harvester|carrot|The carrots travel along a longer web to separate out the soil.
Carrot harvester|carrot|The carrot roots travel along one or more webs to remove most of the soil attached to the carrot
Carrot harvester|carrot|The carrots are collected either in a storage tank on the machine or in a trailer pulled alongside the machine by another tractor.
Carrot seed oil|carrot|Carrot seed oil is the essential oil extract of the seed from the carrot plant Daucus carota
Carrot seed oil|carrot|The oil has a woody, earthy sweet smell and is yellow or amber-coloured to pale orange-brown in appearance
Carrot seed oil|carrot|The pharmocologically active constituents of carrot seed extract are three flavones
Carrot seed oil|carrot|luteolin, luteolin 3'-O-beta-D-glucopyranoside, and luteolin 4'-O-beta-D-glucopyranoside
Carrot seed oil|carrot|Rather than the extract the distilled (ethereal) oil is used in perfumery and food aromatization
Carrot seed oil|carrot|The main constituent of this oil is carotol.
Carrot seed oil|carrot|Pressed carrot seed oil is extracted by cold-pressing the seeds of the carrot plant
Carrot seed oil|carrot|The properties of pressed carrot seed oil are quite different from those of the essential oil
Carrot seed oil|carrot|It has been used in cosmetics for its alleged anti-aging properties
List of carrot dishes|carrot|This is a list of carrot dishes and foods, which use carrot as a primary ingredient
List of carrot dishes|carrot|The carrot (Daucus carota subsp

Lettuce|lettuce|Lettuce (Lactuca sativa) is an annual plant of the daisy family, Asteraceae
Lettuce|lettuce|It is most often grown as a leaf vegetable, but sometimes for its stem and seeds
Lettuce|lettuce|Lettuce is most often used for salads, although it is also seen in other kinds of food, such as soups, sandwiches and wraps; it can also be grilled
Lettuce|lettuce|One variety, the celtuce (asparagus lettuce), is grown for its stems, which are eaten either raw or cooked
Lettuce|lettuce|In addition to its main use as a leafy green, it has also gathered religious and medicinal significance over centuries of human consumption
Lettuce|lettuce|Europe and North America originally dominated the market for lettuce, but by the late 20th century the consumption of lettuce had spread throughout the world
Lettuce|lettuce|As of 2017, world production of lettuce and chicory was 27 million tonnes, 56% of which came from China.Lettuce was originally farmed by the ancient Egyptians, who transformed it from a plant whose seeds were used to obtain oil into an important food crop raised for its succulent leaves and oil-rich seeds
Lettuce|lettuce|Lettuce spread to the Greeks and Romans; the latter gave it the name lactuca, from which the English lettuce is derived
Lettuce|lettuce|By 50 AD, many types were described, and lettuce appeared often in medieval writings, including several herbals
Lettuce|lettuce|The 16th through 18th centuries saw the development of many varieties in Europe, and by the mid-18th century, cultivars were described that can still be found in gardens.
Lettuce|lettuce|Generally grown as a hardy annual, lettuce is easily cultivated, although it requires relatively low temperatures to prevent it from flowering quickly
Lettuce|lettuce|It can be plagued by numerous nutrient deficiencies, as well as insect and mammal pests, and fungal and bacterial diseases
Lettuce|lettuce|L
Lettuce|lettuce|sativa crosses easily within the species and with some other species within the genus Lactuca
Lettuce|lettuce|Although this trait can be a problem to home gardeners who attempt to save seeds, biologists have used it to broaden the gene pool of cultivated lettuce varieties.
Lettuce|lettuce|Lettuce is a rich source of vitamin K and vitamin A, and a moderate source of folate and iron
Lettuce|lettuce|Contaminated lettuce is often a source of bacterial, viral, and parasitic outbreaks in humans, including E
Lettuce|lettuce|coli and Salmonella.
Lettuce|lettuce|Lactuca sativa is a member of the Lactuca (lettuce) genus and the Asteraceae (sunflower or aster) family
Lettuce|lettuce|The species was first described in 1753 by Carl Linnaeus in the second volume of his Species Plantarum
Lettuce|lettuce|Synonyms for L
Lettuce|lettuce|sativa include Lactuca scariola var
Lettuce|lettuce|sativa, L
Lettuce|lettuce|scariola var
Lettuce|lettuce|integrata and L
Lettuce|lettuce|scariola var
Lettuce|lettuce|integrifolia
Lettuce|lettuce|L
Lettuce|lettuce|scariola is itself a synonym for L
Lettuce|lettuce|serriola, the common wild or prickly lettuce
Lettuce|lettuce|L
Lettuce|lettuce|sativa also has many identified taxonomic groups, subspecies and varieties, which delineate the various cultivar groups of domesticated lettuce
Lettuce|lettuce|Lettuce is closely related to several Lactuca species from southwest Asia; the closest relationship is to L
Lettuce|lettuce|"serriola, an aggressive weed common in temperate and subtropical zones in much of the world.The Romans referred to lettuce as lactuca (lac meaning ""dairy"" in Latin), an allusion to the white substance, latex, exuded by cut stems"
Lettuce|lettuce|"The name Lactuca has become the genus name, while sativa (meaning ""sown"" or ""cultivated"") was added to create the species name"
Lettuce|lettuce|The current word lettuce, originally from Middle English, came from the Old French letues or laitues, which derived from the Roman name
Lettuce|lettuce|The name romaine came from the variety of lettuce grown in the Roman papal gardens, while cos, another term for romaine lettuce, came from the earliest European seeds of the type from the Greek island of Kos, a center of lettuce farming in the Byzantine period.
Lettuce|lettuce|Lettuce's native range spreads from the Mediterranean to Siberia, although it has been transported to almost all areas of the world
Lettuce|lettuce|Plants generally have a height and spread of 15 to 30 cm (6 to 12 in)
Lettuce|lettuce|The leaves are colorful, mainly in the green and red color spectrums, with some variegated varieties
Lettuce|lettuce|There are also a few varieties with yellow, gold or blue-teal leaves.Lettuces have a wide range of shapes and textures, from the dense heads of the iceberg type to the notched, scalloped, frilly or ruffly leaves of leaf varieties
Lettuce|lettuce|Lettuce plants have a root system that includes a main taproot and smaller secondary roots
Lettuce|lettuce|Some varieties, especially those found in the United States and Western Europe, have long, narrow taproots and a small set of secondary roots
Lettuce|lettuce|Longer taproots and more extensive secondary systems are found in varieties from Asia.Depending on the variety and time of year, lettuce generally lives 65–130 days from planting to harvesting
Lettuce|lettuce|"Because lettuce that flowers (through the process known as ""bolting"") becomes bitter and unsaleable, plants grown for consumption are rarely allowed to grow to maturity"
Lettuce|lettuce|Lettuce flowers more quickly in hot temperatures, while freezing temperatures cause slower growth and sometimes damage to outer leaves.Once plants move past the edible stage, they develop flower stalks up to 1 m (3 ft 3 in) high with small yellow blossoms
Lettuce|lettuce|"Like other members of the tribe Cichorieae, lettuce inflorescences (also known as flower heads or capitula) are composed of multiple florets, each with a modified calyx called a pappus (which becomes the feathery ""parachute"" of the fruit), a corolla of five petals fused into a ligule or strap, and the reproductive parts"
Lettuce|lettuce|These include fused anthers that form a tube which surrounds a style and bipartite stigma
Lettuce|lettuce|As the anthers shed pollen, the style elongates to allow the stigmas, now coated with pollen, to emerge from the tube
Lettuce|lettuce|The ovaries form compressed, obovate (teardrop-shaped) dry fruits that do not open at maturity, measuring 3 to 4 mm long
Lettuce|lettuce|The fruits have 5–7 ribs on each side and are tipped by two rows of small white hairs
Lettuce|lettuce|The pappus remains at the top of each fruit as a dispersal structure
Lettuce|lettuce|Each fruit contains one seed, which can be white, yellow, gray or brown depending on the variety of lettuce.The domestication of lettuce over the centuries has resulted in several changes through selective breeding
Lettuce|lettuce|delayed bolting, larger seeds, larger leaves and heads, better taste and texture, a lower latex content, and different leaf shapes and colors
Lettuce|lettuce|Work in these areas continues through the present day
Lettuce|lettuce|Scientific research into the genetic modification of lettuce is ongoing, with over 85 field trials taking place between 1992 and 2005 in the European Union and the United States to test modifications allowing greater herbicide tolerance, greater resistance to insects and fungi and slower bolting patterns
Lettuce|lettuce|However, genetically modified lettuce is not currently used in commercial agriculture.
Lettuce|lettuce|Lettuce was first cultivated in ancient Egypt for the production of oil from its seeds
Lettuce|lettuce|The plant was probably selectively bred by the Egyptians into a plant grown for its edible leaves, with evidence of its cultivation appearing as early as 2680 BC
Lettuce|lettuce|Lettuce was considered a sacred plant of the reproduction god Min, and was carried during his festivals and placed near his images
Lettuce|lettuce|"The plant was thought to help the god ""perform the sexual act untiringly"""
Lettuce|lettuce|Its use in religious ceremonies resulted in the creation of many images in tombs and wall paintings
Lettuce|lettuce|The cultivated variety appears to have been about 75 cm (30 in) tall and resembled a large version of the modern romaine lettuce
Lettuce|lettuce|These upright lettuces were developed by the Egyptians and passed to the Greeks, who in turn shared them with the Romans
Lettuce|lettuce|Around 50 AD, Roman agriculturalist Columella described several lettuce varieties – some of which may have been ancestors of today's lettuces.Lettuce appears in many medieval writings, especially as a medicinal herb
Lettuce|lettuce|Hildegard of Bingen mentioned it in her writings on medicinal herbs between 1098 and 1179, and many early herbals also describe its uses
Lettuce|lettuce|In 1586, Joachim Camerarius provided descriptions of the three basic modern lettuces – head lettuce, loose-leaf lettuce, and romaine (or cos) lettuce
Lettuce|lettuce|Lettuce was first brought to the Americas from Europe by Christopher Columbus in the late 15th century
Lettuce|lettuce|Between the late 16th century and the early 18th century, many varieties were developed in Europe, particularly Holland
Lettuce|lettuce|Books published in the mid-18th and early 19th centuries describe several varieties found in gardens today.Due to its short lifespan after harvest, lettuce was originally sold relatively close to where it was grown
Lettuce|lettuce|The early 20th century saw the development of new packing, storage and shipping technologies that improved the lifespan and transportability of lettuce and resulted in a significant increase in availability
Lettuce|lettuce|During the 1950s, lettuce production was revolutionized with the development of vacuum cooling, which allowed field cooling and packing of lettuce, replacing the previously used method of ice-cooling in packing houses outside the fields.Lettuce is very easy to grow, and as such has been a significant source of sales for many seed companies
Lettuce|lettuce|Tracing the history of many varieties is complicated by the practice of many companies, particularly in the US, of changing a variety's name from year to year
Lettuce|lettuce|"This practice is conducted for several reasons, the most prominent being to boost sales by promoting a ""new"" variety, or to prevent customers from knowing that the variety had been developed by a competing seed company"
Lettuce|lettuce|Documentation from the late 19th century shows between 65 and 140 distinct varieties of lettuce, depending on the amount of variation allowed between types – a distinct difference from the 1,100 named lettuce varieties on the market at the time
Lettuce|lettuce|Names also often changed significantly from country to country
Lettuce|lettuce|Although most lettuce grown today is used as a vegetable, a minor amount is used in the production of tobacco-free cigarettes; however, domestic lettuce's wild relatives produce a leaf that visually more closely resembles tobacco.
Lettuce|lettuce|A hardy annual, some varieties of lettuce can be overwintered even in relatively cold climates under a layer of straw, and older, heirloom varieties are often grown in cold frames
Lettuce|lettuce|Lettuces meant for the cutting of individual leaves are generally planted straight into the garden in thick rows
Lettuce|lettuce|Heading varieties of lettuces are commonly started in flats, then transplanted to individual spots, usually 20 to 36 cm (7.9 to 14.2 in) apart, in the garden after developing several leaves
Lettuce|lettuce|Lettuce spaced farther apart receives more sunlight, which improves color and nutrient quantities in the leaves
Lettuce|lettuce|Pale to white lettuce, such as the centers in some iceberg lettuce, contain few nutrients.
Lettuce|lettuce|Lettuce grows best in full sun in loose, nitrogen-rich soils with a pH of between 6.0 and 6.8
Lettuce|lettuce|Heat generally prompts lettuce to bolt, with most varieties growing poorly above 24 °C (75 °F); cool temperatures prompt better performance, with 16 to 18 °C (61 to 64 °F) being preferred and as low as 7 °C (45 °F) being tolerated
Lettuce|lettuce|Plants in hot areas that are provided partial shade during the hottest part of the day will bolt more slowly
Lettuce|lettuce|Temperatures above 27 °C (81 °F) will generally result in poor or non-existent germination of lettuce seeds
Lettuce|lettuce|After harvest, lettuce lasts the longest when kept at 0 °C (32 °F) and 96 percent humidity
Lettuce|lettuce|Lettuce quickly degrades when stored with fruit such as apples, pears and bananas that release the ripening agent ethylene gas
Lettuce|lettuce|The high water content of lettuce (94.9 percent) creates problems when attempting to preserve the plant – it cannot be successfully frozen, canned or dried and must be eaten fresh
Lettuce|lettuce|In spite of its high water content, traditionally grown lettuce has a low water footprint, with 237 liters of water required for each kilogram of lettuce produced
Lettuce|lettuce|Hydroponic growing methods can reduce this water consumption by nearly two orders of magnitude.
Lettuce|lettuce|Lettuce varieties will cross with each other, making spacing of 1.5 to 6 m (60 to 240 in) between varieties necessary to prevent contamination when saving seeds
Lettuce|lettuce|Lettuce will also cross with Lactuca serriola (wild lettuce), with the resulting seeds often producing a plant with tough, bitter leaves
Lettuce|lettuce|Celtuce, a lettuce variety grown primarily in Asia for its stems, crosses easily with lettuces grown for their leaves
Lettuce|lettuce|This propensity for crossing, however, has led to breeding programs using closely related species in Lactuca, such as L
Lettuce|lettuce|serriola, L
Lettuce|lettuce|saligna, and L
Lettuce|lettuce|virosa, to broaden the available gene pool
Lettuce|lettuce|Starting in the 1990s, such programs began to include more distantly related species such as L
Lettuce|lettuce|tatarica.Seeds keep best when stored in cool conditions, and, unless stored cryogenically, remain viable the longest when stored at −20 °C (−4 °F); they are relatively short lived in storage
Lettuce|lettuce|At room temperature, lettuce seeds remain viable for only a few months
Lettuce|lettuce|However, when newly harvested lettuce seed is stored cryogenically, this life increases to a half-life of 500 years for vaporized nitrogen and 3,400 years for liquid nitrogen; this advantage is lost if seeds are not frozen promptly after harvesting.
Lettuce|lettuce|There are several types or cultivars of lettuce
Lettuce|lettuce|Three types – leaf, head and cos or romaine – are the most common
Lettuce|lettuce|There are seven main cultivar groups of lettuce, each including many varieties:
Lettuce|lettuce|Leaf – Also known as looseleaf, cutting or bunching lettuce, this type has loosely bunched leaves and is the most widely planted
Lettuce|lettuce|It is used mainly for salads.
Lettuce|lettuce|Romaine/Cos – Used mainly for salads and sandwiches, this type forms long, upright heads
Lettuce|lettuce|This is the most often used lettuce in Caesar salads.
Lettuce|lettuce|Iceberg/Crisphead – The most popular type in the United States, Iceberg lettuce is very heat-sensitive and was originally adapted for growth in the northern United States
Lettuce|lettuce|It ships well, but is low in flavor and nutritional content, being composed of even more water than other lettuce types.
Lettuce|lettuce|Summercrisp – Also called Batavian or French crisp, this lettuce is midway between the crisphead and leaf types
Lettuce|lettuce|These lettuces tend to be larger, bolt-resistant and well-flavored.
Lettuce|lettuce|Oilseed – This type is grown for its seeds, which are pressed to extract an oil mainly used for cooking
Lettuce|lettuce|It has few leaves, bolts quickly and produces seeds around 50 percent larger than other types of lettuce.
Lettuce|lettuce|Soil nutrient deficiencies can cause a variety of plant problems that range from malformed plants to a lack of head growth
Lettuce|lettuce|Many insects are attracted to lettuce, including cutworms, which cut seedlings off at the soil line; wireworms and nematodes, which cause yellow, stunted plants; tarnished plant bugs and aphids, which cause yellow, distorted leaves; leafhoppers, which cause stunted growth and pale leaves; thrips, which turn leaves gray-green or silver; leafminers, which create tunnels within the leaves; flea beetles, which cut small holes in leaves and caterpillars, slugs and snails, which cut large holes in leaves
Lettuce|lettuce|For example, the larvae of the ghost moth is a common pest of lettuce plants
Lettuce|lettuce|Mammals, including rabbits and groundhogs, also eat the plants
Lettuce|lettuce|Lettuce contains several defensive compounds, including sesquiterpene lactones, and other natural phenolics such as flavonol and glycosides, which help to protect it against pests
Lettuce|lettuce|Certain varieties contain more than others, and some selective breeding and genetic modification studies have focused on using this trait to identify and produce commercial varieties with increased pest resistance.Lettuce also suffers from several viral diseases, including big vein, which causes yellow, distorted leaves, and mosaic virus, which is spread by aphids and causes stunted plant growth and deformed leaves
Lettuce|lettuce|Aster yellows are a disease-causing bacteria carried by leafhoppers, which causes deformed leaves
Lettuce|lettuce|Fungal diseases include powdery mildew and downy mildew, which cause leaves to mold and die and bottom rot, lettuce drop and gray mold, which cause entire plants to rot and collapse
Lettuce|lettuce|Bacterial diseases include Botrytis cinerea, for which UV-C treatments may be used
Lettuce|lettuce|Vàsquez et al 2017 find that phenylalanine ammonia-lyase activity, phenolic production, and B
Lettuce|lettuce|cinerea resistance are increased by UV-C
Lettuce|lettuce|Crowding lettuce tends to attract pests and diseases
Lettuce|lettuce|Weeds can also be an issue, as cultivated lettuce is generally not competitive with them, especially when directly seeded into the ground
Lettuce|lettuce|Transplanted lettuce (started in flats and later moved to growing beds) is generally more competitive initially, but can still be crowded later in the season, causing misshapen lettuce and lower yields
Lettuce|lettuce|Weeds also act as homes for insects and disease and can make harvesting more difficult
Lettuce|lettuce|Herbicides are often used to control weeds in commercial production
Lettuce|lettuce|However, this has led to the development of herbicide-resistant weeds in lettuce cultivation.
Lettuce|lettuce|Lettuce is the only member of the genus Lactuca to be grown commercially
Lettuce|lettuce|Although China is the top world producer of lettuce, the majority of the crop is consumed domestically
Lettuce|lettuce|Spain is the world's largest exporter of lettuce, with the US ranking second.Western Europe and North America were the original major markets for large-scale lettuce production
Lettuce|lettuce|By the late 1900s, Asia, South America, Australia and Africa became more substantial markets
Lettuce|lettuce|Different locations tended to prefer different types of lettuce, with butterhead prevailing in northern Europe and Great Britain, romaine in the Mediterranean and stem lettuce in China and Egypt
Lettuce|lettuce|By the late 20th century, the preferred types began to change, with crisphead, especially iceberg, lettuce becoming the dominant type in northern Europe and Great Britain and more popular in western Europe
Lettuce|lettuce|In the US, no one type predominated until the early 20th century, when crisphead lettuces began gaining popularity
Lettuce|lettuce|After the 1940s, with the development of iceberg lettuce, 95 percent of the lettuce grown and consumed in the US was crisphead lettuce
Lettuce|lettuce|By the end of the century, other types began to regain popularity and eventually made up over 30 percent of production
Lettuce|lettuce|Stem lettuce was first developed in China, where it remains primarily cultivated.In the early 21st century, bagged salad products increased in the lettuce market, especially in the US where innovative packaging and shipping methods prolonged freshness.In the United States in 2013, California (71%) and Arizona (29%) produced nearly all of the country's fresh head and leaf lettuce, with head lettuce yielding $9400 of value per acre and leaf lettuce $8000 per acre.
Lettuce|lettuce|As described around 50 AD, lettuce leaves were often cooked and served by the Romans with an oil-and-vinegar dressing; however, smaller leaves were sometimes eaten raw
Lettuce|lettuce|During the 81–96 AD reign of Domitian, the tradition of serving a lettuce salad before a meal began
Lettuce|lettuce|Post-Roman Europe continued the tradition of poaching lettuce, mainly with large romaine types, as well as the method of pouring a hot oil and vinegar mixture over the leaves.Today, the majority of lettuce is grown for its leaves, although one type is grown for its stem and one for its seeds, which are made into an oil
Lettuce|lettuce|Most lettuce is used in salads, either alone or with other greens, vegetables, meats and cheeses
Lettuce|lettuce|Romaine lettuce is often used for Caesar salads
Lettuce|lettuce|"Lettuce leaves can also be found in soups, sandwiches and wraps, while the stems are eaten both raw and cooked.The consumption of lettuce in China developed differently from in Western countries, due to health risks and cultural aversion to eating raw leaves; Chinese ""salads"" are composed of cooked vegetables and are served hot or cold"
Lettuce|lettuce|Lettuce is also used in a larger variety of dishes than in Western countries, contributing to a range of dishes including bean curd and meat dishes, soups and stir-frys plain or with other vegetables
Lettuce|lettuce|Stem lettuce, widely consumed in China, is eaten either raw or cooked, the latter primarily in soups and stir-frys
Lettuce|lettuce|Lettuce is also used as a primary ingredient in the preparation of lettuce soup.
Lettuce|lettuce|Depending on the variety, lettuce is an excellent source (20% of the Daily Value, DV, or higher) of vitamin K (97% DV) and vitamin A (21% DV) (table), with higher concentrations of the provitamin A compound, beta-carotene, found in darker green lettuces, such as romaine
Lettuce|lettuce|With the exception of the iceberg variety, lettuce is also a good source (10–19% DV) of folate and iron (table).
Lettuce|lettuce|Food-borne pathogens that can survive on lettuce include Listeria monocytogenes, the causative agent of listeriosis, which multiplies in storage
Lettuce|lettuce|However, despite high levels of bacteria being found on ready-to-eat lettuce products, a 2008 study found no incidences of food-borne illness related to listeriosis, possibly due to the product's short shelf life, indigenous microflora competing with the Listeria bacteria or inhibition of bacteria to cause listeriosis.Other bacteria found on lettuce include Aeromonas species, which have not been linked to any outbreaks; Campylobacter species, which cause campylobacteriosis; and Yersinia intermedia and Yersinia kristensenii (species of Yersinia), which have been found mainly in lettuce
Lettuce|lettuce|Lettuce has been linked to numerous outbreaks of the bacteria E
Lettuce|lettuce|coli O157:H7 and Shigella; the plants were most likely contaminated through contact with animal feces
Lettuce|lettuce|A 2007 study determined that the vacuum cooling method, especially prevalent in the California lettuce industry, increased the uptake and survival rates of E
Lettuce|lettuce|coli O157:H7
Lettuce|lettuce|Salmonella bacteria, including the uncommon Salmonella braenderup type, have also caused outbreaks traced to contaminated lettuce
Lettuce|lettuce|Viruses, including hepatitis A, calicivirus and a Norwalk-like strain, have been found in lettuce
Lettuce|lettuce|The vegetable has also been linked to outbreaks of parasitic infestations, including Giardia lamblia.
Lettuce|lettuce|In addition to its usual purpose as an edible leafy vegetable, lettuce has had a number of uses in ancient (and even some more modern) folk medicine and religious symbolism
Lettuce|lettuce|For example, ancient Egyptians thought lettuce to be a symbol of sexual prowess and a promoter of love and childbearing in women
Lettuce|lettuce|The Romans likewise claimed that it increased sexual potency
Lettuce|lettuce|In contrast, the ancient Greeks connected the plant with male impotency, and served it during funerals (probably due to its role in the myth of Adonis' death), and British women in the 19th century believed it would cause infertility and sterility.
Lettuce|lettuce|"Lettuce has mild narcotic properties; it was called ""sleepwort"" by the Anglo-Saxons because of this attribute, although the cultivated L"
Lettuce|lettuce|sativa has lower levels of the narcotic than its wild cousins
Lettuce|lettuce|"This narcotic effect is a property of two sesquiterpene lactones (lactucin and lactucopicrin) which are found in the white liquid (latex) in the stems of lettuce, called lactucarium or ""lettuce opium"""
Lettuce|lettuce|"Although the standard definition of lactucarium requires its production from Lactuca virosa or ""wild lettuce"", it was recognized that smaller quantities of lactucarium could be produced in a similar way from Lactuca sativa and Lactuca canadensis var"
Lettuce|lettuce|elongata, and that lettuce-opium obtained from Lactuca serriola or Lactuca quercina was of superior quality.Romaine lettuce is one of the symbolic items on the Jewish Passover Seder plate as a bitter herb.Some American settlers claimed that smallpox could be prevented through the ingestion of lettuce, and an Iranian belief suggested consumption of the seeds when afflicted with typhoid
Lettuce|lettuce|Folk medicine has also claimed it as a treatment for pain, rheumatism, tension and nervousness, coughs and insanity; scientific evidence of these benefits in humans has not been found
Lettuce|lettuce|The religious ties of lettuce continue into the present day among the Yazidi people of northern Iraq, who have a religious prohibition against eating the plant.

Cauliflower|cauliflower|Cauliflower is one of several vegetables in the species Brassica oleracea in the genus Brassica, which is in the Brassicaceae (or Mustard) family
Cauliflower|cauliflower|It is an annual plant that reproduces by seed
Cauliflower|cauliflower|"Typically, only the head is eaten – the edible white flesh sometimes called ""curd"" (with a similar appearance to cheese curd)"
Cauliflower|cauliflower|The cauliflower head is composed of a white inflorescence meristem
Cauliflower|cauliflower|Cauliflower heads resemble those in broccoli, which differs in having flower buds as the edible portion
Cauliflower|cauliflower|"Brassica oleracea also includes broccoli, Brussels sprouts, cabbage, collard greens, and kale, collectively called ""cole"" crops, though they are of different cultivar groups."
Cauliflower|cauliflower|Pliny the Elder  included cyma among cultivated plants he described in Natural History
Cauliflower|cauliflower|"""Ex omnibus brassicae generibus suavissima est cyma,"" (""Of all the varieties of cabbage the most pleasant-tasted is cyma"")"
Cauliflower|cauliflower|Pliny's description likely refers to the flowering heads of an earlier cultivated variety of Brassica oleracea.In the Middle Ages, early forms of cauliflower were associated with the island of Cyprus, with the 12th- and 13th-century Arab botanists Ibn al-'Awwam and Ibn al-Baitar, claiming its origin to be Cyprus
Cauliflower|cauliflower|This association continued into Western Europe, where cauliflowers were sometimes known as Cyprus colewort, and there was extensive trade in western Europe in cauliflower seeds from Cyprus, under the French Lusignan rulers of the island, until well into the 16th century.François Pierre La Varenne employed chouxfleurs in Le cuisinier françois
Cauliflower|cauliflower|"They were introduced to France from Genoa in the 16th century, and are featured in Olivier de Serres' Théâtre de l'agriculture (1600), as cauli-fiori ""as the Italians call it, which are still rather rare in France; they hold an honorable place in the garden because of their delicacy"", but they did not commonly appear on grand tables until the time of Louis XIV"
Cauliflower|cauliflower|It was introduced to India in 1822 by the British.
Cauliflower|cauliflower|"The word ""cauliflower"" derives from the Italian cavolfiore, meaning ""cabbage flower"""
Cauliflower|cauliflower|The ultimate origin of the name is from the Latin words caulis (cabbage) and flōs (flower).
Cauliflower|cauliflower|Because weather is a limiting factor for producing cauliflower, the plant grows best in moderate daytime temperatures 21–29 °C (70–85 °F), with plentiful sun, and moist soil conditions high in organic matter and sandy soils
Cauliflower|cauliflower|The earliest maturity possible for cauliflower is 7 to 12 weeks from transplanting
Cauliflower|cauliflower|In the northern hemisphere, fall season plantings in July may enable harvesting before autumn frost.Long periods of sun exposure in hot summer weather may cause cauliflower heads to discolor with a red-purple hue.
Cauliflower|cauliflower|Transplantable cauliflowers can be produced in containers as flats, hotbeds, or in the field
Cauliflower|cauliflower|In soil that is loose, well-drained and fertile, field seedlings are shallow-planted 1 cm (1⁄2 in) and thinned by ample space – about 12 plants per 30 cm (1 ft)
Cauliflower|cauliflower|Ideal growing temperatures are about 18 °C (65 °F) when seedlings are 25 to 35 days old
Cauliflower|cauliflower|Applications of fertilizer to developing seedlings begin when leaves appear, usually with a starter solution weekly.
Cauliflower|cauliflower|Transplanting to the field normally begins late spring and may continue until mid-summer
Cauliflower|cauliflower|Row spacing is about 38–46 cm (15–18 in)
Cauliflower|cauliflower|The most important disorders affecting cauliflower quality are a hollow stem, stunted head growth or buttoning, ricing, browning and leaf-tip burn
Cauliflower|cauliflower|Among major pests affecting cauliflower are aphids, root maggots, cutworms, moths, and flea beetles
Cauliflower|cauliflower|The plant is susceptible to black rot, black leg, club root, black leaf spot, and downy mildew.
Cauliflower|cauliflower|When cauliflower is mature, heads appear as clear white, compact, and 15–20 cm (6–8 in) in diameter, and should be cooled shortly after harvest
Cauliflower|cauliflower|Forced air cooling to remove heat from the field during hot weather may be needed for optimal preservation
Cauliflower|cauliflower|Short-term storage is possible using cool, high-humidity storage conditions.
Cauliflower|cauliflower|Italian
Cauliflower|cauliflower|This specimen is diverse in appearance, biennial and annual in type
Cauliflower|cauliflower|This group also includes white, Romanesco, various brown, green, purple, and yellow cultivars
Cauliflower|cauliflower|This type is the ancestral form from which the others were derived.
Cauliflower|cauliflower|Northern European annuals
Cauliflower|cauliflower|Used in Europe and North America for summer and fall harvest, it was developed in Germany in the 18th century and includes the old cultivars Erfurt and Snowball.
Cauliflower|cauliflower|Northwest European biennial
Cauliflower|cauliflower|Used in Europe for winter and early spring harvest, this was developed in France in the 19th century and includes the old cultivars Angers and Roscoff.
Cauliflower|cauliflower|Asian
Cauliflower|cauliflower|A tropical cauliflower used in China and India, it was developed in India during the 19th century from the now-abandoned Cornish type and includes old varieties Early Benaras and Early Patna.
Cauliflower|cauliflower|There are hundreds of historic and current commercial varieties used around the world
Cauliflower|cauliflower|A comprehensive list of about 80 North American varieties is maintained at North Carolina State University.
Cauliflower|cauliflower|Orange cauliflower contains beta-carotene as the orange pigment, a provitamin A compound
Cauliflower|cauliflower|This orange trait originated from a natural mutant found in a cauliflower field in Canada
Cauliflower|cauliflower|Cultivars include 'Cheddar' and 'Orange Bouquet'.
Cauliflower|cauliflower|Green cauliflower in the B
Cauliflower|cauliflower|oleracea Botrytis Group is sometimes called broccoflower
Cauliflower|cauliflower|It is available in the normal curd (head) shape and with a fractal spiral curd called Romanesco broccoli
Cauliflower|cauliflower|Both have been commercially available in the U.S
Cauliflower|cauliflower|and Europe since the early 1990s
Cauliflower|cauliflower|Green-headed varieties include 'Alverda', 'Green Goddess' and 'Vorda'
Cauliflower|cauliflower|Romanesco varieties include 'Minaret' and 'Veronica'.
Cauliflower|cauliflower|The purple color in this cauliflower is caused by the presence of anthocyanins, water-soluble pigments that are found in many other plants and plant-based products, such as red cabbage and red wine
Cauliflower|cauliflower|Varieties include 'Graffiti' and 'Purple Cape'.
Cauliflower|cauliflower|In 2016, global production of cauliflowers (combined for production reports with broccoli) was 25.2 million tonnes, led by China and India which, combined, had 73% of the world total
Cauliflower|cauliflower|Secondary producers, having 0.4–1.3 million tonnes annually, were the United States, Spain, Mexico and Italy.
Cauliflower|cauliflower|Raw cauliflower is 92% water, 5% carbohydrates, 2% protein, and contains negligible fat (table)
Cauliflower|cauliflower|A 100-gram (3+1⁄2-ounce) reference amount of raw cauliflower provides 104 kilojoules (25 kilocalories) of food energy, and has a high content (20% or more of the Daily Value, DV) of vitamin C (58% DV) and moderate levels of several B vitamins and vitamin K (13–15% DV; table)
Cauliflower|cauliflower|Contents of dietary minerals are low (7% DV or less).
Cauliflower|cauliflower|Cauliflower contains several non-nutrient phytochemicals common in the cabbage family that are under preliminary research for their potential properties, including isothiocyanates and glucosinolates
Cauliflower|cauliflower|Boiling reduces the levels of cauliflower glucosinolates, while other cooking methods, such as steaming, microwaving, and stir frying, have no significant effect on glucosinolate levels.
Cauliflower|cauliflower|Cauliflower heads can be roasted, grilled, boiled, fried, steamed, pickled, or eaten raw
Cauliflower|cauliflower|"When cooking, the outer leaves and thick stalks are typically removed, leaving only the florets (the edible ""curd"" or ""head"")"
Cauliflower|cauliflower|The leaves are also edible but are often discarded.Cauliflower is a low-calorie, gluten-free alternative to rice and flour
Cauliflower|cauliflower|Between 2012 and 2016, cauliflower production in the United States increased 63%, and cauliflower-based product sales increased 71% between 2017 and 2018
Cauliflower|cauliflower|Cauliflower rice is made by pulsing cauliflower florets followed by cooking the result in oil
Cauliflower|cauliflower|Cauliflower pizza crust is made from cauliflower flour and is popular in pizza restaurants
Cauliflower|cauliflower|Mashed cauliflower is a low-carbohydrate alternative to mashed potatoes.
Cauliflower|cauliflower|"One of the fractal properties of cauliflower is that every branch, or ""module"", is similar to the entire cauliflower"
Cauliflower|cauliflower|"Another quality, also present in other plant species, is that the angle between ""modules,"" as they become more distant from the center, is 360 degrees divided by the golden ratio."

Tomato|tomato|The tomato is the edible berry of the plant Solanum lycopersicum, commonly known as a tomato plant
Tomato|tomato|The species originated in western South America and Central America
Tomato|tomato|The Nahuatl word tomatl gave rise to the Spanish word tomate, from which the English word tomato derived
Tomato|tomato|Its domestication and use as a cultivated food may have originated with the indigenous peoples of Mexico
Tomato|tomato|The Aztecs used tomatoes in their cooking at the time of the Spanish conquest of the Aztec Empire, and after the Spanish encountered the tomato for the first time after their contact with the Aztecs, they brought the plant to Europe, in a widespread transfer of plants known as the columbian exchange
Tomato|tomato|From there, the tomato was introduced to other parts of the European-colonized world during the 16th century.Tomatoes are a significant source of umami flavor.
Tomato|tomato|The tomato is consumed in diverse ways, raw or cooked, in many dishes, sauces, salads, and drinks
Tomato|tomato|While tomatoes are fruits—botanically classified as berries—they are commonly used as a vegetable ingredient or side dish.Numerous varieties of the tomato plant are widely grown in temperate climates across the world, with greenhouses allowing for the production of tomatoes throughout all seasons of the year
Tomato|tomato|Tomato plants typically grow to 1–3 meters (3–10 ft) in height
Tomato|tomato|They are vines that have a weak stem that sprawls and typically needs support
Tomato|tomato|Indeterminate tomato plants are perennials in their native habitat, but are cultivated as annuals
Tomato|tomato|(Determinate, or bush, plants are annuals that stop growing at a certain height and produce a crop all at once.) The size of the tomato varies according to the cultivar, with a range of 1–10 cm (1⁄2–4 in) in width.
Tomato|tomato|The word tomato comes from the Spanish tomate, which in turn comes from the Nahuatl word tomatl [ˈtomat͡ɬ] pronunciation , meaning 'swelling fruit'; also  'fat water' or 'fat thing'
Tomato|tomato|The native Mexican tomatillo is tomate
Tomato|tomato|When Aztecs started to cultivate the fruit to be larger, sweeter and red, they called the new variety xitomatl (or jitomates) (pronounced [ʃiːˈtomatɬ]), ('plump with navel' or 'fat water with navel')
Tomato|tomato|The scientific species name lycopersicum (from the 1753 book, Species Plantarum) is of Greek origin (λύκοπερσικων; lykopersikon), meaning 'wolf peach'.
Tomato|tomato|The usual pronunciations of tomato are  (usual in American English) and  (usual in British English)
Tomato|tomato|"The word's dual pronunciations were immortalized in Ira and George Gershwin's 1937 song ""Let's Call the Whole Thing Off"" (""You like  and I like  / You like  and I like "") and have become a symbol for nitpicking pronunciation disputes"
Tomato|tomato|In this capacity, it has even become an American and British slang term
Tomato|tomato|"saying """" when presented with two choices can mean ""What's the difference?"" or ""It's all the same to me""."
Tomato|tomato|Tomato plants are vines, initially decumbent, typically growing 180 cm (6 ft) or more above the ground if supported, although erect bush varieties have been bred, generally 100 cm (3 ft 3 in) tall or shorter
Tomato|tomato|"Indeterminate types are ""tender"" perennials, dying annually in temperate climates (they are originally native to tropical highlands), although they can live up to three years in a greenhouse in some cases"
Tomato|tomato|Determinate types are annual in all climates.Tomato plants are dicots, and grow as a series of branching stems, with a terminal bud at the tip that does the actual growing
Tomato|tomato|When that tip eventually stops growing, whether because of pruning or flowering, lateral buds take over and grow into other, fully functional, vines.Tomato vines are typically pubescent, meaning covered with fine short hairs
Tomato|tomato|These hairs facilitate the vining process, turning into roots wherever the plant is in contact with the ground and moisture, especially if the vine's connection to its original root has been damaged or severed.Most tomato plants have compound leaves, and are called regular leaf (RL) plants, but some cultivars have simple leaves known as potato leaf (PL) style because of their resemblance to that particular relative
Tomato|tomato|Of RL plants, there are variations, such as rugose leaves, which are deeply grooved, and variegated, angora leaves, which have additional colors where a genetic mutation causes chlorophyll to be excluded from some portions of the leaves.The leaves are 10–25 cm (4–10 in) long, odd pinnate, with five to nine leaflets on petioles, each leaflet up to 8 cm (3 in) long, with a serrated margin; both the stem and leaves are densely glandular-hairy.Their flowers, appearing on the apical meristem, have the anthers fused along the edges, forming a column surrounding the pistil's style
Tomato|tomato|Flowers in domestic cultivars can be self-fertilizing
Tomato|tomato|The flowers are 1–2 cm (1⁄2–3⁄4 in) across, yellow, with five pointed lobes on the corolla; they are borne in a cyme of three to 12 together.Although in culinary terms, tomato is regarded as a vegetable, its fruit is classified botanically as a berry
Tomato|tomato|As a true fruit, it develops from the ovary of the plant after fertilization, its flesh comprising the pericarp walls
Tomato|tomato|The fruit contains hollow spaces full of seeds and moisture, called locular cavities
Tomato|tomato|These vary, among cultivated species, according to type
Tomato|tomato|Some smaller varieties have two cavities, globe-shaped varieties typically have three to five, beefsteak tomatoes have a great number of smaller cavities, while paste tomatoes have very few, very small cavities.For propagation, the seeds need to come from a mature fruit, and be dried or fermented before germination.
Tomato|tomato|In 1753, Linnaeus placed the tomato in the genus Solanum (alongside the potato) as Solanum lycopersicum
Tomato|tomato|In 1768, Philip Miller moved it to its own genus, naming it Lycopersicon esculentum
Tomato|tomato|This name came into wide use, but was technically in breach of the plant naming rules because Linnaeus's species name lycopersicum still had priority
Tomato|tomato|Although the name Lycopersicum lycopersicum was suggested by Karsten (1888), this is not used because it violates the International Code of Nomenclature barring the use of tautonyms in botanical nomenclature
Tomato|tomato|The corrected name Lycopersicon lycopersicum (Nicolson 1974) was technically valid, since Miller's genus name and Linnaeus's species name differ in exact spelling, but since Lycopersicon esculentum has become so well known, it was officially listed as a nomen conservandum in 1983, and would be the correct name for the tomato in classifications which do not place the tomato in the genus Solanum.
Tomato|tomato|Genetic evidence has now shown that Linnaeus was correct to put the tomato in the genus Solanum, making Solanum lycopersicum the correct name
Tomato|tomato|Both names, however, will probably be found in the literature for some time
Tomato|tomato|Two of the major reasons for considering the genera separate are the leaf structure (tomato leaves are markedly different from any other Solanum), and the biochemistry (many of the alkaloids common to other Solanum species are conspicuously absent in the tomato)
Tomato|tomato|On the other hand, hybrids of tomato and diploid potato can be created in the lab by somatic fusion, and are partially fertile, providing evidence of the close relationship between these species.
Tomato|tomato|Tomatoes that have been modified using genetic engineering have been developed, and although none are commercially available now, they have been in the past
Tomato|tomato|The first commercially available genetically modified food was a variety of tomato named the Flavr Savr, which was engineered to have a longer shelf life
Tomato|tomato|Scientists are continuing to develop tomatoes with new traits not found in natural crops, such as increased resistance to pests or environmental stresses
Tomato|tomato|Other projects aim to enrich tomatoes with substances that may offer health benefits or provide better nutrition.
Tomato|tomato|An international consortium of researchers from 10 countries, among them researchers from the Boyce Thompson Institute for Plant Research, began sequencing the tomato genome in 2004, and is creating a database of genomic sequences and information on the tomato and related plants
Tomato|tomato|A prerelease version of the genome was made available in December 2009
Tomato|tomato|The genomes of its mitochondria and chloroplasts are also being sequenced as part of the project
Tomato|tomato|The complete genome for the cultivar Heinz 1706 was published on 31 May 2012 in Nature
Tomato|tomato|Since many other fruits, like strawberries, apples, melons, and bananas share the same characteristics and genes, researchers stated the published genome could help to improve food quality, food security and reduce costs of all of these fruits.
Tomato|tomato|The Tomato Genetic Resource Center, Germplasm Resources Information Network, AVRDC, and numerous seed banks around the world store seed representing genetic variations of value to modern agriculture
Tomato|tomato|These seed stocks are available for legitimate breeding and research efforts
Tomato|tomato|While individual breeding efforts can produce useful results, the bulk of tomato breeding work is at universities and major agriculture-related corporations
Tomato|tomato|These efforts have resulted in significant regionally adapted breeding lines and hybrids, such as the Mountain series from North Carolina
Tomato|tomato|Corporations including Heinz, Monsanto, BHNSeed, and Bejoseed have breeding programs that attempt to improve production, size, shape, color, flavor, disease tolerance, pest tolerance, nutritional value, and numerous other traits.
Tomato|tomato|Botanically, a tomato is a fruit—a berry, consisting of the ovary, together with its seeds, of a flowering plant
Tomato|tomato|"However, the tomato is considered a ""culinary vegetable"" because it has a much lower sugar content than culinary fruits; because it is more savoury (umami) than sweet, it is typically served as part of a salad or main course of a meal, rather than as a dessert"
Tomato|tomato|Tomatoes are not the only food source with this ambiguity; bell peppers, cucumbers, green beans, eggplants, avocados, and squashes of all kinds (such as zucchini and pumpkins) are all botanically fruit, yet cooked as vegetables
Tomato|tomato|This has led to legal dispute in the United States
Tomato|tomato|In 1887, U.S
Tomato|tomato|tariff laws that imposed a duty on vegetables, but not on fruit, caused the tomato's status to become a matter of legal importance
Tomato|tomato|In Nix v
Tomato|tomato|Hedden, the U.S
Tomato|tomato|Supreme Court settled the tariff controversy on May 10, 1893, by declaring that the tomato is a vegetable, based on the popular definition that classifies vegetables by use—they are generally served with dinner and not dessert
Tomato|tomato|The holding of this case applies only to the interpretation of the Tariff of 1883, and the court did not purport to reclassify the tomato for botanical or other purposes.
Tomato|tomato|The wild ancestor of the tomato is native to western South America
Tomato|tomato|These wild versions were the size of peas
Tomato|tomato|Aztecs and other peoples in Mesoamerica were the first to have domesticated the fruit and used in their cooking
Tomato|tomato|The Spanish first introduced tomatoes to Europe, where they became used in Spanish food
Tomato|tomato|In France, Italy and northern Europe, the tomato was initially grown as an ornamental plant
Tomato|tomato|It was regarded with suspicion as a food because botanists recognized it as a nightshade, a relative of the poisonous belladonna
Tomato|tomato|This was exacerbated by the interaction of the tomato's acidic juice with pewter plates
Tomato|tomato|The leaves and immature fruit contains tomatine, which in large quantities would be toxic
Tomato|tomato|However, the ripe fruit contains no tomatine.
Tomato|tomato|The exact date of domestication is unknown; by 500 BC, it was already being cultivated in southern Mexico and probably other areas.
Tomato|tomato|13  The Pueblo people are thought to have believed that those who witnessed the ingestion of tomato seeds were blessed with powers of divination
Tomato|tomato|The large, lumpy variety of tomato, a mutation from a smoother, smaller fruit, originated in Mesoamerica, and may be the direct ancestor of some modern cultivated tomatoes.
Tomato|tomato|15 The Aztecs raised several varieties of tomato, with red tomatoes called xictomatl and green tomatoes called tomatl (Tomatillo)
Tomato|tomato|Bernardino de Sahagún reported seeing a great variety of tomatoes in the Aztec market at Tenochtitlán (Mexico City)
Tomato|tomato|“

Tomato|tomato|Bernardino de Sahagún mentioned Aztecs cooking various sauces, some with and without tomatoes of different sizes, serving them in city markets
Tomato|tomato|"""foods sauces, hot sauces; fried [food], olla-cooked [food], juices, sauces of juices, shredded [food] with chile, with squash seeds [most likely Cucurbita pepo], with tomatoes, with smoked chile, with hot chile, with yellow chile, with mild red chile sauce, yellow chile sauce, hot chile sauce, with ""bird excrement"" sauce, sauce of smoked chile, heated [sauces], bean sauce; [he sells] toasted beans, cooked beans, mushroom sauce, sauce of small squash, sauce of large tomatoes, sauce of ordinary tomatoes, sauce of various kinds of sour herbs, avocado sauce."""
Tomato|tomato|Spanish conquistador Hernán Cortés may have been the first to transfer a small yellow tomato to Europe after he captured the Aztec city of Tenochtitlan, now Mexico City, in 1521
Tomato|tomato|The earliest discussion of the tomato in European literature appeared in a herbal written in 1544 by Pietro Andrea Mattioli, an Italian physician and botanist, who suggested that a new type of eggplant had been brought to Italy that was blood red or golden color when mature and could be divided into segments and eaten like an eggplant—that is, cooked and seasoned with salt, black pepper, and oil
Tomato|tomato|"It was not until ten years later that tomatoes were named in print by Mattioli as pomi d'oro, or ""golden apples""."
Tomato|tomato|13 After the Spanish colonization of the Americas, the Spanish distributed the tomato throughout their colonies in the Caribbean
Tomato|tomato|They also took it to the Philippines, from where it spread to southeast Asia and then the entire Asian continent
Tomato|tomato|The Spanish also brought the tomato to Europe
Tomato|tomato|It grew easily in Mediterranean climates, and cultivation began in the 1540s
Tomato|tomato|It was probably eaten shortly after it was introduced, and was certainly being used as food by the early 17th century in Spain.
Tomato|tomato|The tomato was introduced to China, likely via the Philippines or Macau, in the 1500s
Tomato|tomato|It was given the name fānqié (barbarian eggplant), as the Chinese named many foodstuffs introduced from abroad, but referring specifically to early introductions.
Tomato|tomato|"The recorded history of tomatoes in Italy dates back to at least 31 October 1548, when the house steward of Cosimo de' Medici, the grand duke of Tuscany, wrote to the Medici private secretary informing him that the basket of tomatoes sent from the grand duke's Florentine estate at Torre del Gallo ""had arrived safely"""
Tomato|tomato|Tomatoes were grown mainly as ornamentals early on after their arrival in Italy
Tomato|tomato|"For example, the Florentine aristocrat Giovanvettorio Soderini wrote how they ""were to be sought only for their beauty"", and were grown only in gardens or flower beds"
Tomato|tomato|The tomato's ability to mutate and create new and different varieties helped contribute to its success and spread throughout Italy
Tomato|tomato|However, even in areas where the climate supported growing tomatoes, their habit of growing to the ground suggested low status
Tomato|tomato|They were not adopted as a staple of the peasant population because they were not as filling as other fruits already available
Tomato|tomato|Additionally, both toxic and inedible varieties discouraged many people from attempting to consume or prepare any other varieties
Tomato|tomato|In certain areas of Italy, such as Florence, the fruit was used solely as a tabletop decoration, until it was incorporated into the local cuisine in the late 17th or early 18th century
Tomato|tomato|The earliest discovered cookbook with tomato recipes was published in Naples in 1692, though the author had apparently obtained these recipes from Spanish sources.
Tomato|tomato|17 Unique varieties were developed over the next several hundred years for uses such as dried tomatoes, sauce tomatoes, pizza tomatoes, and tomatoes for long-term storage
Tomato|tomato|These varieties are usually known for their place of origin as much as by a variety name
Tomato|tomato|"For example, Pomodorino del Piennolo del Vesuvio is the ""hanging tomato of Vesuvius"", or the well known and highly-prized San Marzano plum tomato grown in that region."
Tomato|tomato|Tomatoes were not grown in England until the 1590s.
Tomato|tomato|17  One of the earliest cultivators was John Gerard, a barber-surgeon.
Tomato|tomato|17  Gerard's Herbal, published in 1597, and largely plagiarized from continental sources,
Tomato|tomato|17  is also one of the earliest discussions of the tomato in England
Tomato|tomato|Gerard knew the tomato was eaten in Spain and Italy.
Tomato|tomato|17  Nonetheless, he believed it was poisonous
Tomato|tomato|17  (in fact, the plant and raw fruit do have low levels of tomatine, but are not generally dangerous; see below)
Tomato|tomato|Gerard's views were influential, and the tomato was considered unfit for eating (though not necessarily poisonous) for many years in Britain and its North American colonies.
Tomato|tomato|"17 However, by the mid-18th century, tomatoes were widely eaten in Britain, and before the end of that century, the Encyclopædia Britannica stated the tomato was ""in daily use"" in soups, broths, and as a garnish"
Tomato|tomato|"They were not part of the average person's diet, and though by 1820 they were described as ""to be seen in great abundance in all our vegetable markets"" and to be ""used by all our best cooks"", reference was made to their cultivation in gardens still ""for the singularity of their appearance"", while their use in cooking was associated with exotic Italian or Jewish cuisine."
Tomato|tomato|It was grown from the 18th century onwards for the British
Tomato|tomato|"Even today, in Bengal, the alternative name is ""Biliti Begun"" (Bengali"
Tomato|tomato|"বিলিতি বেগুন), meaning ""Foreign Eggplant"""
Tomato|tomato|The tomato was introduced to cultivation in the Middle East by John Barker, British consul in Aleppo circa 1799 to 1825
Tomato|tomato|Nineteenth century descriptions of its consumption are uniformly as an ingredient in a cooked dish
Tomato|tomato|"In 1881, it is described as only eaten in the region ""within the last forty years"""
Tomato|tomato|Today, the tomato is a critical and ubiquitous part of Middle Eastern cuisine, served fresh in salads (e.g., Arab salad, Israeli salad, Shirazi salad and Turkish salad), grilled with kebabs and other dishes, made into sauces, and so on.
Tomato|tomato|The earliest reference to tomatoes being grown in British North America is from 1710, when herbalist William Salmon reported seeing them in what is today South Carolina.
Tomato|tomato|25  They may have been introduced from the Caribbean
Tomato|tomato|By the mid-18th century, they were cultivated on some Carolina plantations, and probably in other parts of the Southeast as well
Tomato|tomato|Possibly, some people continued to think tomatoes were poisonous at this time; and in general, they were grown more as ornamental plants than as food
Tomato|tomato|Thomas Jefferson, who ate tomatoes in Paris, sent some seeds back to America.
Tomato|tomato|28  Some early American advocates of the culinary use of the tomato included Michele Felice Cornè and Robert Gibbon Johnson.Early tomato breeders included Henry Tilden in Iowa and a Dr
Tomato|tomato|Hand in Baltimore.Alexander W
Tomato|tomato|Livingston receives much credit for developing numerous varieties of tomato for both home and commercial gardeners
Tomato|tomato|The U.S
Tomato|tomato|"Department of Agriculture's 1937 yearbook declared that ""half of the major varieties were a result of the abilities of the Livingstons to evaluate and perpetuate superior material in the tomato."" Livingston's first breed of tomato, the Paragon, was introduced in 1870, the beginning of a great tomato culture enterprise in the county"
Tomato|tomato|In 1875, he introduced the Acme, which was said to be involved in the parentage of most of the tomatoes introduced by him and his competitors for the next twenty-five years.When Livingston began his attempts to develop the tomato as a commercial crop, his aim had been to grow tomatoes smooth in contour, uniform in size, and sweet in flavor
Tomato|tomato|He eventually developed over seventeen different varieties of the tomato plant
Tomato|tomato|Today, the crop is grown in every state in the Union.Because of the long growing season needed for this heat-loving crop, several states in the US Sun Belt became major tomato-producers, particularly Florida and California
Tomato|tomato|In California, tomatoes are grown under irrigation for both the fresh fruit market and for canning and processing
Tomato|tomato|The University of California, Davis (UC Davis) became a major center for research on the tomato
Tomato|tomato|The C.M
Tomato|tomato|Rick Tomato Genetics Resource Center at UC Davis is a gene bank of wild relatives, monogenic mutants and miscellaneous genetic stocks of tomato
Tomato|tomato|The center is named for the late Dr
Tomato|tomato|Charles M
Tomato|tomato|Rick, a pioneer in tomato genetics research
Tomato|tomato|Research on processing tomatoes is also conducted by the California Tomato Research Institute in Escalon, California.In California, growers have used a method of cultivation called dry-farming, especially with Early Girl tomatoes
Tomato|tomato|This technique encourages the plant to send roots deep to find existing moisture in soil that retains moisture, such as clayey soil.
Tomato|tomato|The poor taste and lack of sugar in modern garden and commercial tomato varieties resulted from breeding tomatoes to ripen uniformly red
Tomato|tomato|"This change occurred after discovery of a mutant ""u"" phenotype in the mid 20th century that ripened ""u""niformly"
Tomato|tomato|This was widely cross-bred to produce red fruit without the typical green ring around the stem on uncross-bred varieties
Tomato|tomato|Prior to general introduction of this trait, most tomatoes produced more sugar during ripening, and were sweeter and more flavorful.Evidence has been found that 10–20% of the total carbon fixed in the fruit can be produced by photosynthesis in the developing fruit of the normal U phenotype
Tomato|tomato|The u genetic mutation encodes a factor that produces defective chloroplasts with lower density in developing fruit, resulting in a lighter green colour of unripe fruit, and repression of sugars accumulation in the resulting ripe fruit by 10–15%
Tomato|tomato|Perhaps more important than their role in photosynthesis, the fruit chloroplasts are remodelled during ripening into chlorophyll-free chromoplasts that synthesize and accumulate the carotenoids lycopene, β-carotene, and other metabolites that are sensory and nutritional assets of the ripe fruit
Tomato|tomato|The potent chloroplasts in the dark-green shoulders of the U phenotype are beneficial here, but have the disadvantage of leaving green shoulders near the stems of the ripe fruit, and even cracked yellow shoulders, apparently because of oxidative stress due to overload of the photosynthetic chain in direct sunlight at high temperatures
Tomato|tomato|Hence genetic design of a commercial variety that combines the advantages of types u and U requires fine tuning, but may be feasible.Furthermore, breeders of modern tomato cultivars typically strive to produce tomato plants exhibiting improved yield, shelf life, size, and tolerance/resistance to various environmental pressures, including disease
Tomato|tomato|However, these breeding efforts have yielded unintended negative consequences on various tomato fruit attributes
Tomato|tomato|For instance, linkage drag is a phenomenon that has been responsible for alterations in the metabolism of the tomato fruit
Tomato|tomato|Linkage drag describes the introduction of an undesired trait or allele into a plant during backcrossing
Tomato|tomato|This trait/allele is physically linked (or is very close) to the desired allele along the chromosome
Tomato|tomato|In introducing the beneficial allele, there exists a high likelihood that the poor allele is also incorporated into the plant
Tomato|tomato|Thus, breeding efforts attempting to enhance certain traits (for example
Tomato|tomato|larger fruit size) have unintentionally altered production of chemicals associated with, for instance, nutritional value and flavor.Breeders have turned to using wild tomato species as a source of alleles for the introduction of beneficial traits into modern tomato varieties
Tomato|tomato|For example, wild tomato relatives may possess higher amounts of fruit solids (which are associated with greater sugar content) or resistance to diseases caused by microbes, such as resistance towards the early blight pathogen Alternaria solani
Tomato|tomato|However, this tactic has limitations, for the incorporation of certain traits, such as pathogen resistance, can negatively impact other favorable phenotypes (fruit production, etc.).
Tomato|tomato|The tomato is grown worldwide for its edible fruits, with thousands of cultivars
Tomato|tomato|A fertilizer with an NPK ratio of 5–10–10 is often sold as tomato fertilizer or vegetable fertilizer, although manure and compost are also used
Tomato|tomato|On average there are 150,000 seeds in a pound of tomato seeds.
Tomato|tomato|Tomato cultivars vary widely in their resistance to disease
Tomato|tomato|Modern hybrids focus on improving disease resistance over the heirloom plants.
Tomato|tomato|Various forms of mildew and blight are common tomato afflictions, which is why tomato cultivars are often marked with a combination of letters that refer to specific disease resistance
Tomato|tomato|The most common letters are
Tomato|tomato|LB – late blight, V – verticillium wilt, F – fusarium wilt strain I, FF – fusarium wilt strain I and II, N – nematodes, T – tobacco mosaic virus, and A – alternaria.
Tomato|tomato|Some common tomato pests are the tomato bug, stink bugs, cutworms, tomato hornworms and tobacco hornworms, aphids, cabbage loopers, whiteflies, tomato fruitworms, flea beetles, red spider mite, slugs, and Colorado potato beetles
Tomato|tomato|The tomato russet mite, Aculops lycopersici, feeds on foliage and young fruit of tomato plants, causing shrivelling and necrosis of leaves, flowers, and fruit, possibly killing the plant.A common tomato disease is tobacco mosaic virus
Tomato|tomato|Handling cigarettes and other infected tobacco products can transmit the virus to tomato plants.Another particularly dreaded disease is curly top, carried by the beet leafhopper, which interrupts the lifecycle
Tomato|tomato|As the name implies, it has the symptom of making the top leaves of the plant wrinkle up and grow abnormally.After an insect attack tomato plants produce systemin, a plant peptide hormone 
Tomato|tomato|Systemin activates defensive mechanisms, such as the production of protease inhibitors to slow the growth of insects
Tomato|tomato|The hormone was first identified in tomatoes, but similar proteins have been identified in other species since.Although not a disease as such, irregular supplies of water can cause growing or ripening fruit to split
Tomato|tomato|Besides cosmetic damage, the splits may allow decay to start, although growing fruits have some ability to heal after a split
Tomato|tomato|In addition, a deformity called cat-facing can be caused by pests, temperature stress, or poor soil conditions
Tomato|tomato|Affected fruit usually remains edible, but its appearance may be unsightly.
Tomato|tomato|Among the most famous pairings is the tomato plant and carrots; studies supporting this relationship have produced a popular book about companion planting, Carrots Love Tomatoes.The devastating tomato hornworm has a major predator in various parasitic wasps, whose larvae devour the hornworm, but whose adult form drinks nectar from tiny-flowered plants like umbellifers
Tomato|tomato|Several species of umbellifer are therefore often grown with tomato plants, including parsley, Queen Anne's lace, and occasionally dill
Tomato|tomato|These also attract predatory flies that attack various tomato pests.Borage is thought to repel the tomato hornworm moth.Plants with strong scents, like alliums (onions, chives, garlic), mints (basil, oregano, spearmint) and French marigold, (Tagetes patula) are thought to mask the scent of the tomato plant, making it harder for pests to locate it, or to provide an alternative landing point, reducing the odds of the pests from attacking the correct plant
Tomato|tomato|These plants may also subtly affect the flavor of tomato fruit.Tomato plants can protect asparagus from asparagus beetles, because they contain solanine that kills this pest, while asparagus plants contain Asparagusic acid that repels nematodes known to attack tomato plants
Tomato|tomato|Marigolds also repel nematodes.
Tomato|tomato|In the wild, original state, tomatoes required cross-pollination; they were much more self-incompatible than domestic cultivars
Tomato|tomato|As a floral device to reduce selfing, the pistil of wild tomatoes extends farther out of the flower than today's cultivars
Tomato|tomato|The stamens were, and remain, entirely within the closed corolla.
Tomato|tomato|As tomatoes were moved from their native areas, their traditional pollinators, (probably a species of halictid bee) did not move with them
Tomato|tomato|The trait of self-fertility became an advantage, and domestic cultivars of tomato have been selected to maximize this trait.This is not the same as self-pollination, despite the common claim that tomatoes do so
Tomato|tomato|"That tomatoes pollinate themselves poorly without outside aid is clearly shown in greenhouse situations, where pollination must be aided by artificial wind, vibration of the plants (one brand of vibrator is a wand called an ""electric bee"" that is used manually), or more often today, by cultured bumblebees"
Tomato|tomato|The anther of a tomato flower is shaped like a hollow tube, with the pollen produced within the structure, rather than on the surface, as in most species
Tomato|tomato|The pollen moves through pores in the anther, but very little pollen is shed without some kind of externally-induced motion
Tomato|tomato|The ideal vibratory frequencies to release pollen grains are provided by an insect, such as a bumblebee, or the original wild halictid pollinator, capable of engaging in a behavior known as buzz pollination, which honey bees cannot perform
Tomato|tomato|In an outdoors setting, wind or animals usually provide sufficient motion to produce commercially viable crops.
Tomato|tomato|Pollination and fruit formation depend on meiosis
Tomato|tomato|Meiosis is central to the processes by which diploid microspore mother cells within the anther give rise to haploid pollen grains, and megaspore mother cells in ovules that are contained within the ovary give rise to haploid nuclei
Tomato|tomato|Union of haploid nuclei from pollen and ovule (fertilization) can occur either by self- or cross-pollination
Tomato|tomato|Fertilization leads to the formation of a diploid zygote that can then develop into an embryo within the emerging seed
Tomato|tomato|Repeated fertilizations within the ovary are accompanied by maturation of the ovary to form the tomato fruit.
Tomato|tomato|Homologs of the recA gene, including rad51, play a key role in homologous recombinational repair of DNA during meiosis
Tomato|tomato|A rad51 homolog is present in the anther of tomato (Lycopersicon esculentum), suggesting that recombinational repair occurs during meiosis in tomato.
Tomato|tomato|Tomatoes are often grown in greenhouses in cooler climates, and cultivars such as the British 'Moneymaker' and a number of cultivars grown in Siberia are specifically bred for indoor growing
Tomato|tomato|In more temperate climates, it is not uncommon to start seeds in greenhouses during the late winter for future transplant.
Tomato|tomato|Greenhouse tomato production in large-acreage commercial greenhouses and owner-operator stand-alone or multiple-bay greenhouses is on the increase, providing fruit during those times of the year when field-grown fruit is not readily available
Tomato|tomato|Smaller sized fruit (cherry and grape), or cluster tomatoes (fruit-on-the-vine) are the fruit of choice for the large commercial greenhouse operators while the beefsteak varieties are the choice of owner-operator growers.Hydroponic technique is often used in hostile growing environments, as well as high-density plantings.
Tomato|tomato|"To facilitate transportation and storage, tomatoes are often picked unripe (green) and ripened in storage with ethylene.A machine-harvestable variety of tomato (the ""square tomato"") was developed in the 1950s by University of California, Davis's Gordie C"
Tomato|tomato|Hanna, which, in combination with the development of a suitable harvester, revolutionized the tomato-growing industry
Tomato|tomato|This type of tomato is grown commercially near plants that process and can tomatoes, tomato sauce, and tomato paste
Tomato|tomato|They are harvested when ripe and are flavorful when picked
Tomato|tomato|They are harvested 24 hours a day, seven days a week during a 12- to 14-week season, and immediately transported to packing plants, which operate on the same schedule
Tomato|tomato|California is a center of this sort of commercial tomato production and produces about a third of the processed tomatoes produced in the world.In 1994, Calgene introduced a genetically modified tomato called the FlavrSavr, which could be vine ripened without compromising shelf life
Tomato|tomato|However, the product was not commercially successful, and was sold only until 1997.
Tomato|tomato|"As of 2008, the heaviest tomato harvested, weighed 3.51 kg (7 lb 12 oz), was of the cultivar ""Delicious"", and was grown by Gordon Graham of Edmond, Oklahoma in 1986"
Tomato|tomato|"The largest tomato plant grown was of the cultivar ""Sungold"" and reached 19.8 m (65 ft) in length, grown by Nutriculture Ltd (UK) of Mawdesley, Lancashire, UK, in 2000.A massive ""tomato tree"" growing inside the Walt Disney World Resort's experimental greenhouses in Lake Buena Vista, Florida may have been the largest single tomato plant in the world"
Tomato|tomato|The plant has been recognized as a Guinness World Record Holder, with a harvest of more than 32,000 tomatoes and a total weight of 522 kg (1,151 lb)
Tomato|tomato|It yielded thousands of tomatoes at one time from a single vine
Tomato|tomato|Yong Huang, Epcot's manager of agricultural science, discovered the unique plant in Beijing, China
Tomato|tomato|Huang brought its seeds to Epcot and created the specialized greenhouse for the fruit to grow
Tomato|tomato|The vine grew golf ball-sized tomatoes, which were served at Walt Disney World restaurants
Tomato|tomato|The tree developed a disease and was removed in April 2010 after about 13 months of life.
Tomato|tomato|Although tomatoes originated in the Americas, they have become extensively used in Mediterranean cuisine
Tomato|tomato|Ripe tomatoes contain significant umami flavor and they are a key ingredient in pizza, and are commonly used in pasta sauces.
Tomato|tomato|The tomato is now grown and eaten around the world
Tomato|tomato|It is used in diverse ways, including raw in salads or in slices, stewed, incorporated into a wide variety of dishes, or processed into ketchup or tomato soup
Tomato|tomato|Unripe green tomatoes can also be breaded and fried, used to make salsa, or pickled
Tomato|tomato|Tomato juice is sold as a drink, and is used in cocktails such as the Bloody Mary.
Tomato|tomato|Tomatoes keep best unwashed at room temperature and out of direct sunlight
Tomato|tomato|It is not recommended to refrigerate them as this can harm the flavour
Tomato|tomato|Tomatoes stored cold tend to lose their flavour permanently.Storing stem down can prolong shelf life, as it may keep from rotting too quickly.Tomatoes that are not yet ripe can be kept in a paper bag till ripening.Tomatoes are easy to preserve whole, in pieces, as tomato sauce or paste by home canning
Tomato|tomato|They are acidic enough to process in a water bath rather than a pressure cooker as most vegetables require
Tomato|tomato|The fruit is also preserved by drying, often in the sun, and sold either in bags or in jars with oil.
Tomato|tomato|The leaves, stem, and green unripe fruit of the tomato plant contain small amounts of the alkaloid tomatine, whose effect on humans has not been studied
Tomato|tomato|They also contain small amounts of solanine, a toxic alkaloid found in potato leaves and other plants in the nightshade family
Tomato|tomato|However, solanine concentrations in foliage and green fruit are generally too small to be dangerous unless large amounts are consumed—for example, as greens.
Tomato|tomato|Small amounts of tomato foliage are sometimes used for flavoring without ill effect, and the green fruit of unripe red tomato varieties is sometimes used for cooking, particularly as fried green tomatoes
Tomato|tomato|There are also tomato varieties with fully ripe fruit that is still green
Tomato|tomato|Compared to potatoes, the amount of solanine in unripe green or fully ripe tomatoes is low
Tomato|tomato|However, even in the case of potatoes, while solanine poisoning resulting from dosages several times the normal human consumption has been demonstrated, actual cases of poisoning from excessive consumption of potatoes are rare.Tomato plants can be toxic to dogs if they eat large amounts of the fruit, or chew plant material.
Tomato|tomato|Tomatoes were linked to seven Salmonella outbreaks between 1990 and 2005, and may have been the cause of a salmonellosis outbreak causing 172 illnesses in 18 US states in 2006
Tomato|tomato|The 2008 United States salmonellosis outbreak caused the temporary removal of tomatoes from stores and restaurants across the United States and parts of Canada, although other foods, including jalapeño and serrano peppers, may have been involved.

Cucumber|cucumber|Cucumber (Cucumis sativus) is a widely-cultivated creeping vine plant in the Cucurbitaceae family that bears usually cylindrical fruits, which are used as vegetables
Cucumber|cucumber|Considered an annual plant, there are three main varieties of cucumber — slicing, pickling, and burpless/seedless — within which several cultivars have been created
Cucumber|cucumber|The cucumber originates from South Asia, but now grows on most continents, as many different types of cucumber are traded on the global market
Cucumber|cucumber|In North America, the term wild cucumber refers to plants in the genera Echinocystis and Marah, though the two are not closely related.
Cucumber|cucumber|The cucumber is a creeping vine that roots in the ground and grows up trellises or other supporting frames, wrapping around supports with thin, spiraling tendrils
Cucumber|cucumber|The plant may also root in a soilless medium, whereby it will sprawl along the ground in lieu of a supporting structure
Cucumber|cucumber|The vine has large leaves that form a canopy over the fruits.The fruit of typical cultivars of cucumber is roughly cylindrical, but elongated with tapered ends, and may be as large as 62 centimeters (24 in) long and 10 centimeters (4 in) in diameter.Cucumber fruits consist of 95% water (see nutrition table)
Cucumber|cucumber|In botanical terms, the cucumber is classified as a pepo, a type of botanical berry with a hard outer rind and no internal divisions
Cucumber|cucumber|However, much like tomatoes and squashes, it is often perceived, prepared, and eaten as a vegetable.
Cucumber|cucumber|Most cucumber cultivars are seeded and require pollination
Cucumber|cucumber|For this purpose, thousands of honey beehives are annually carried to cucumber fields just before bloom
Cucumber|cucumber|Cucumbers may also be pollinated via bumblebees and several other bee species
Cucumber|cucumber|Most cucumbers that require pollination are self-incompatible, thus requiring the pollen of another plant in order to form seeds and fruit
Cucumber|cucumber|Some self-compatible cultivars exist that are related to the 'Lemon' cultivar.A few cultivars of cucumber are parthenocarpic, the blossoms of which create seedless fruit without pollination, which degrades the eating quality of these cultivar
Cucumber|cucumber|In the United States, these are usually grown in greenhouses, where bees are excluded
Cucumber|cucumber|In Europe, they are grown outdoors in some regions, where bees are likewise excluded.Traditional cultivars produce male blossoms first, then female, in about equivalent numbers
Cucumber|cucumber|Newer gynoecious hybrid cultivars produce almost all female blossoms
Cucumber|cucumber|They may have a pollenizer cultivar interplanted, and the number of beehives per unit area is increased, but temperature changes induce male flowers even on these plants, which may be sufficient for pollination to occur.In 2009, an international team of researchers announced they had sequenced the cucumber genome.
Cucumber|cucumber|In a 100-gram (3+1⁄2-ounce) reference serving, raw cucumber (with peel) is 95% water, 4% carbohydrates, 1% protein, and contains negligible fat
Cucumber|cucumber|Cucumber provides 67 kilojoules (16 kilocalories) of food energy, and supplies low content of micronutrients, as it is notable only for vitamin K at 16% of the Daily Value (table).
Cucumber|cucumber|Depending on variety, cucumbers may have a mild melon aroma and flavor, in part resulting from unsaturated aldehydes, such as (E,Z)-nona-2,6-dienal, and the cis- and trans- isomers of 2-nonenal
Cucumber|cucumber|The slightly bitter taste of cucumber rind results from cucurbitacins.
Cucumber|cucumber|In general cultivation, cucumbers are classified into three main cultivar groups
Cucumber|cucumber|slicing, pickled, and seedless/burpless.
Cucumber|cucumber|Cucumbers grown to eat fresh are called slicing cucumbers
Cucumber|cucumber|The main varieties of slicers mature on vines with large leaves that provide shading.Slicers grown commercially for the North American market are generally longer, smoother, more uniform in color, and have much tougher skin
Cucumber|cucumber|In contrast, those in other countries, often called European cucumbers, are smaller and have thinner, more delicate skin, often with fewer seeds, thus are often being sold in plastic skin for protection
Cucumber|cucumber|This variety may also be called a telegraph cucumber, particularly in Australasia.
Cucumber|cucumber|Pickling with brine, sugar, vinegar, and spices creates various flavored products from cucumbers and other foods
Cucumber|cucumber|Although any cucumber can be pickled, commercial pickles are made from cucumbers specially bred for uniformity of length-to-diameter ratio and lack of voids in the flesh
Cucumber|cucumber|Those cucumbers intended for pickling, called picklers, grow to about 7 to 10 cm (3 to 4 in) long and 2.5 cm (1 in) wide
Cucumber|cucumber|Compared to slicers, picklers tend to be shorter, thicker, less-regularly shaped, and have bumpy skin with tiny white or black-dotted spines
Cucumber|cucumber|Color can vary from creamy yellow to pale or dark green.
Cucumber|cucumber|Gherkins, also called cornichons, or baby pickles, are small cucumbers, typically those 2.5 to 12.5 centimetres (1 to 5 in) in length, often with bumpy skin, which are typically used for pickling
Cucumber|cucumber|The word gherkin comes from the early modern Dutch gurken or augurken ('small pickled cucumber')
Cucumber|cucumber|The term is also used in the name for Cucumis anguria, the West Indian gherkin, a closely related species.
Cucumber|cucumber|Burpless cucumbers are sweeter and have a thinner skin than other varieties of cucumber
Cucumber|cucumber|They are reputed to be easy to digest and to have a pleasant taste
Cucumber|cucumber|They can grow as long as 60 centimeters (2 ft), are nearly seedless, and have a delicate skin
Cucumber|cucumber|Most commonly grown in greenhouses, these parthenocarpic cucumbers are often found in grocery markets, shrink-wrapped in plastic
Cucumber|cucumber|They are marketed as either burpless or seedless, as the seeds and skin of other varieties of cucumbers are said to give some people gas.
Cucumber|cucumber|Cultivated for at least 3,000 years, the cucumber originated from India, where a great many varieties have been observed, along with its closest living relative, Cucumis hystrix
Cucumber|cucumber|It was probably introduced to Europe by the Greeks or Romans
Cucumber|cucumber|Records of cucumber cultivation appear in France in the 9th century, England in the 14th century, and in North America by the mid-16th century.
Cucumber|cucumber|According to Pliny the Elder, the Emperor Tiberius had the cucumber on his table daily during summer and winter
Cucumber|cucumber|In order to have it available for his table every day of the year, the Romans reportedly used artificial methods of growing (similar to the greenhouse system), whereby mirrorstone refers to Pliny's lapis specularis, believed to have been sheet mica:
Cucumber|cucumber|Reportedly, they were also cultivated in specularia, cucumber houses glazed with oiled cloth
Cucumber|cucumber|Pliny describes the Italian fruit as very small, probably like a gherkin
Cucumber|cucumber|He also describes the preparation of a medication known as elaterium
Cucumber|cucumber|However, some scholars believe that he was instead referring to Ecballium elaterium, known in pre-Linnean times as Cucumis silvestris or Cucumis asininus ('wild cucumber' or 'donkey cucumber'), a species different from the common cucumber
Cucumber|cucumber|"Pliny also writes about several other varieties of cucumber, including the cultivated cucumber, and remedies from the different types (9 from the cultivated; 5 from the ""anguine;"" and 26 from the ""wild"")."
Cucumber|cucumber|Charlemagne had cucumbers grown in his gardens in the 8th/9th century
Cucumber|cucumber|They were reportedly introduced into England in the early 14th century, lost, then reintroduced approximately 250 years later
Cucumber|cucumber|The Spaniards (through the Italian Christopher Columbus) brought cucumbers to Haiti in 1494
Cucumber|cucumber|"In 1535, Jacques Cartier, a French explorer, found ""very great cucumbers"" grown on the site of what is now Montreal."
Cucumber|cucumber|Throughout the 16th century, European trappers, traders, bison hunters, and explorers bartered for the products of American Indian agriculture
Cucumber|cucumber|The tribes of the Great Plains and the Rocky Mountains learned from the Spanish how to grow European crops
Cucumber|cucumber|The farmers on the Great Plains included the Mandan and Abenaki
Cucumber|cucumber|They obtained cucumbers and watermelons from the Spanish, and added them to the crops they were already growing, including several varieties of corn and beans, pumpkins, squash, and gourd plants
Cucumber|cucumber|The Iroquois were also growing them when the first Europeans visited them.
Cucumber|cucumber|In 1630, the Reverend Francis Higginson produced a book called New-Englands Plantation in which, describing a garden on Conant's Island in Boston Harbor known as The Governor's Garden, he states:The countrie aboundeth naturally with store of roots of great varietie [sic] and good to eat
Cucumber|cucumber|Our turnips, parsnips, and carrots are here both bigger and sweeter than is ordinary to be found in England
Cucumber|cucumber|Here are store of pompions, cowcumbers, and other things of that nature which I know not…In New England Prospect (1633, England), William Wood published observations he made in 1629 in America:The ground affords very good kitchin gardens, for Turneps, Parsnips, Carrots, Radishes, and Pompions, Muskmillons, Isquoter-squashes, coucumbars, Onyons, and whatever grows well in England grows as well there, many things being better and larger
Cucumber|cucumber|[sic]
Cucumber|cucumber|In the later 17th century, a prejudice developed against uncooked vegetables and fruits
Cucumber|cucumber|A number of articles in contemporary health publications stated that uncooked plants brought on summer diseases and should be forbidden to children
Cucumber|cucumber|"The cucumber kept this reputation for an inordinate period of time, ""fit only for consumption by cows,"" which some believe is why it gained the name, cowcumber."
Cucumber|cucumber|Samuel Pepys wrote in his diary on 22 August 1663:[T]his day Sir W
Cucumber|cucumber|Batten tells me that Mr
Cucumber|cucumber|Newburne is dead of eating cowcumbers, of which the other day I heard of another, I think.
Cucumber|cucumber|A copper etching made by Maddalena Bouchard between 1772 and 1793 shows this plant to have smaller, almost bean-shaped fruits, and small yellow flowers
Cucumber|cucumber|"The small form of the cucumber is figured in Herbals of the 16th century, however stating that ""[i]f hung in a tube while in blossom, the Cucumber will grow to a most surprising length."""
Spinach|spinach|Spinach (Spinacia oleracea) is a leafy green flowering plant native to central and western Asia
Spinach|spinach|It is of the order Caryophyllales, family Amaranthaceae, subfamily Chenopodioideae
Spinach|spinach|Its leaves are a common edible vegetable consumed either fresh, or after storage using preservation techniques by canning, freezing, or dehydration
Spinach|spinach|It may be eaten cooked or raw, and the taste differs considerably; the high oxalate content may be reduced by steaming.
Spinach|spinach|It is an annual plant (rarely biennial), growing as tall as 30 cm (1 ft)
Spinach|spinach|Spinach may overwinter in temperate regions
Spinach|spinach|The leaves are alternate, simple, ovate to triangular, and very variable in size
Spinach|spinach|2–30 cm (1–12 in) long and 1–15 cm (0.4–5.9 in) broad, with larger leaves at the base of the plant and small leaves higher on the flowering stem
Spinach|spinach|The flowers are inconspicuous, yellow-green, 3–4 mm (0.1–0.2 in) in diameter, and mature into a small, hard, dry, lumpy fruit cluster 5–10 mm (0.2–0.4 in) across containing several seeds
Spinach|spinach|"The English word ""spinach"" dates to the late 14th century from espinache (French"
Spinach|spinach|épinard).
Spinach|spinach|Common spinach (S
Spinach|spinach|oleracea) was long considered to be in the family Chenopodiaceae, but in 2003 that family was merged into the Amaranthaceae in the order Caryophyllales
Spinach|spinach|Within the family Amaranthaceae sensu lato, Spinach belongs to the subfamily Chenopodioideae.
Spinach|spinach|Raw spinach is 91% water, 4% carbohydrates, 3% protein, and contains negligible fat
Spinach|spinach|In a 100 g (3.5 oz) serving providing only 23 calories, spinach has a high nutritional value, especially when fresh, frozen, steamed, or quickly boiled
Spinach|spinach|It is a rich source (20% or more of the Daily Value, DV) of vitamin A, vitamin C, vitamin K, magnesium, manganese, iron and folate
Spinach|spinach|Spinach is a good source (10-19% of DV) of the B vitamins riboflavin and vitamin B6, vitamin E, calcium, potassium, and dietary fiber
Spinach|spinach|Although spinach is touted as being high in iron and calcium content, and is often served and consumed in its raw form, raw spinach contains high levels of oxalates, which block absorption of calcium and iron in the stomach and small intestine
Spinach|spinach|Spinach cooked in several changes of water has much lower levels of oxalates and is better digested and its nutrients absorbed more completely.
Spinach|spinach|Spinach, along with other green, leafy vegetables, contains an appreciable amount of iron attaining 21% of the Daily Value in a 100 g (3.5 oz) amount of raw spinach
Spinach|spinach|For example, the United States Department of Agriculture states that a 100 g (3.5 oz) serving of cooked spinach contains 3.57 mg of iron, whereas a 100 g (3.5 oz) ground hamburger patty contains 1.93 mg of iron
Spinach|spinach|However, spinach contains iron absorption-inhibiting substances, including high levels of oxalate, which can bind to the iron to form ferrous oxalate and render much of the iron in spinach unusable by the body
Spinach|spinach|In addition to preventing absorption and use, high levels of oxalates remove iron from the body.
Spinach|spinach|Spinach also has a moderate calcium content which can be affected by oxalates, decreasing its absorption
Spinach|spinach|The calcium in spinach is among the least bioavailable of food calcium sources
Spinach|spinach|By way of comparison, the human body can absorb about half of the calcium present in broccoli, yet only around 5% of the calcium in spinach.
Spinach|spinach|A quantity of 100 g of spinach contains over four times the recommended daily intake of vitamin K
Spinach|spinach|For this reason, individuals taking the anticoagulant warfarin – which acts by inhibiting vitamin K – are instructed to minimize consumption of spinach (as well as other dark green leafy vegetables) to avoid blunting the effect of warfarin.
Spinach|spinach|In 2018, world production of spinach was 26.3 million tonnes, with China alone accounting for 90% of the total.Fresh spinach is sold loose, bunched, or packaged fresh in bags
Spinach|spinach|Fresh spinach loses much of its nutritional value with storage of more than a few days
Spinach|spinach|Fresh spinach is packaged in air, or in nitrogen gas to extend shelf life
Spinach|spinach|While refrigeration slows this effect to about eight days, fresh spinach loses most of its folate and carotenoid content over this period of time
Spinach|spinach|For longer storage, it is canned, or blanched or cooked and frozen.Some packaged spinach is exposed to radiation to kill any harmful bacteria
Spinach|spinach|The Food and Drug Administration approves of irradiation of spinach leaves up to 4.0 kilograys, having no or only a minor effect on nutrient content
Spinach|spinach|Spinach may be high in cadmium contamination depending on the soil and location where the spinach is grown.
Spinach|spinach|"Spinach is thought to have originated about 2,000 years ago in ancient Persia from which it was introduced to India and ancient China via Nepal in 647 AD as the ""Persian vegetable"""
Spinach|spinach|In AD 827, the Saracens introduced spinach to Sicily
Spinach|spinach|The first written evidence of spinach in the Mediterranean was recorded in three 10th-century works
Spinach|spinach|a medical work by al-Rāzī (known as Rhazes in the West) and in two agricultural treatises, one by Ibn Waḥshīyah and the other by Qusṭus al-Rūmī
Spinach|spinach|Spinach became a popular vegetable in the Arab Mediterranean and arrived in Spain by the latter part of the 12th century, where Ibn al-ʻAwwām called it raʼīs al-buqūl, 'the chieftain of leafy greens'
Spinach|spinach|Spinach was also the subject of a special treatise in the 11th century by Ibn Ḥajjāj.Spinach first appeared in England and France in the 14th century, probably via Spain, and gained common use because it appeared in early spring when fresh local vegetables were not available
Spinach|spinach|Spinach is mentioned in the first known English cookbook, the Forme of Cury (1390), where it is referred to as 'spinnedge' and 'spynoches'
Spinach|spinach|During World War I, wine fortified with spinach juice was given to injured French soldiers with the intent to curtail their bleeding.
Spinach|spinach|The comics and cartoon character Popeye the Sailor Man has been portrayed since 1931 as having a strong affinity for spinach, particularly the canned variety
Spinach|spinach|He becomes physically stronger after consuming it
Spinach|spinach|"This is usually attributed to the iron content of spinach, but in a 1932 strip, Popeye says ""spinach is full of vitamin A an' tha's what makes hoomans strong and helty""."

Leaf vegetable|spinach|Leaf vegetables, also called leafy greens, salad greens, pot herbs, vegetable greens, or simply greens, are plant leaves eaten as a vegetable, sometimes accompanied by tender petioles and shoots
Leaf vegetable|spinach|Although they come from a very wide variety of plants, most share a great deal with other leaf vegetables in nutrition and cooking methods.
Leaf vegetable|spinach|Nearly one thousand species of plants with edible leaves are known
Leaf vegetable|spinach|Leaf vegetables most often come from short-lived herbaceous plants, such as lettuce and spinach
Leaf vegetable|spinach|Woody plants of various species also provide edible leaves.
Leaf vegetable|spinach|The leaves of many fodder crops are also edible for humans, but are usually only eaten under famine conditions
Leaf vegetable|spinach|Examples include alfalfa, clover, most grasses, including wheat and barley
Leaf vegetable|spinach|These plants are often much more prolific than traditional leaf vegetables, but exploitation of their rich nutrition is difficult, due to their high fiber content
Leaf vegetable|spinach|This can be overcome by further processing such as drying and grinding into powder or pulping and pressing for juice.
Leaf vegetable|spinach|Leaf vegetables contain many typical plant nutrients, but since they are photosynthetic tissues, their vitamin K levels are particularly notable
Leaf vegetable|spinach|Phylloquinone, the most common form of the vitamin, is directly involved in photosynthesis.
Leaf vegetable|spinach|Leaf vegetables are typically low in calories and fat, and high in protein per calorie, dietary fiber, vitamin C, pro-vitamin A carotenoids, folate, manganese and vitamin K.The vitamin K content of leaf vegetables is particularly high, since these are photosynthetic tissues and phylloquinone is involved in photosynthesis
Leaf vegetable|spinach|Accordingly, users of vitamin K antagonist medications, such as warfarin, must take special care to limit consumption of leaf vegetables.
Leaf vegetable|spinach|If leaves are cooked for food, they may be referred to as boiled greens
Leaf vegetable|spinach|Leaf vegetables may be stir-fried, stewed, steamed, or consumed raw
Leaf vegetable|spinach|Leaf vegetables stewed with pork is a traditional dish in soul food and Southern U.S
Leaf vegetable|spinach|cuisine
Leaf vegetable|spinach|They are also commonly eaten in a variety of South Asian dishes such as saag
Leaf vegetable|spinach|Leafy greens can be used to wrap other ingredients into an edible package in a manner similar to a tortilla
Leaf vegetable|spinach|Many green leafy vegetables, such as lettuce or spinach, can also be eaten raw, for example in sandwiches or salads
Leaf vegetable|spinach|A green smoothie enables large quantities of raw leafy greens to be consumed by blending the leaves with fruit and water.
Leaf vegetable|spinach|In certain countries of Africa, various species of nutritious amaranth are very widely eaten boiled.Celosia argentea var
Leaf vegetable|spinach|"argentea or ""Lagos spinach"" is one of the main boiled greens in West African cuisine."
Leaf vegetable|spinach|Preboggion, a mixture of different wild boiled greens, is used in Ligurian cuisine to stuff ravioli and pansoti
Leaf vegetable|spinach|One of the main ingredients of preboggion are borage (Borago officinalis) leaves.
Leaf vegetable|spinach|Botwinka (or boćwinka) is a soup that features beet stems and leaves as one of its main ingredients
Leaf vegetable|spinach|"The word ""botwinka"" is the diminutive form of ""botwina"" which refers to leafy vegetables like chard and beet leaves."
Leaf vegetable|spinach|In the cuisine of the Southern United States and traditional African-American cuisine, turnip, collard, kale, garden cress, dandelion, mustard, and pokeweed greens are commonly cooked, and often served with pieces of ham or bacon
Leaf vegetable|spinach|The boiling water, called potlikker, is used as broth
Leaf vegetable|spinach|Water in which pokeweed has been prepared contains toxins removed by the boiling, and should be discarded.Sauteed escarole is a primary ingredient in the Italian-American dish Utica greens.
Leaf vegetable|spinach|Postharvest diseases cause up to 50% losses of leaf vegetables
Leaf vegetable|spinach|These are fungal, bacterial, and much less commonly viral
Leaf vegetable|spinach|The most important remedy is temperature controlled storage, although also important is prevention of mechanical damage to produce as this provides entryways for pathogens
Leaf vegetable|spinach|Uncontaminated water for washing of the vegetables is of lesser but still significant importance.Common bacterial pathogens include

Ipomoea aquatica|spinach|Ipomoea aquatica is a semi-aquatic, tropical plant grown as a vegetable for its tender shoots
Ipomoea aquatica|spinach|This plant is known in English as water spinach, river spinach, water morning glory, water convolvulus, or by the more ambiguous names Chinese spinach, Chinese watercress, Chinese convolvulus or swamp cabbage, or kangkong/kangkung in Southeast Asia and ong choy in Cantonese
Ipomoea aquatica|spinach|Its place of origin is not known.
Ipomoea aquatica|spinach|Ipomoea aquatica grows in water or on moist soil
Ipomoea aquatica|spinach|Its stems are 2–3 metres (7–10 ft) or longer, rooting at the nodes, and they are hollow and can float
Ipomoea aquatica|spinach|The leaves vary from typically sagittate (arrow head-shaped) to lanceolate, 5–15 cm (2–6 in) long and 2–8 cm (0.8–3 in) broad
Ipomoea aquatica|spinach|The flowers are trumpet-shaped, 3–5 cm (1–2 in) in diameter, and usually white in colour with a mauve centre
Ipomoea aquatica|spinach|Propagation is either by planting cuttings of the stem shoots, which will root along nodes, or by planting the seeds from flowers that produce seed pods.
Ipomoea aquatica|spinach|The origin of I
Ipomoea aquatica|spinach|aquatica is not quite clear, but it is agreed that it is native to Southeast Asia
Ipomoea aquatica|spinach|Within Asia, several sources cite China as the location of the plant's domestication
Ipomoea aquatica|spinach|On the other hand, India has been suggested as the location of the plant's origin
Ipomoea aquatica|spinach|However, none of these sources give references other than when the name of I
Ipomoea aquatica|spinach|aquatica first appeared in historical documents
Ipomoea aquatica|spinach|There are also studies suggesting that the species is native to Africa, and it is debated whether it is part of African indigenous flora or whether it was introduced there by Chinese mariner Zheng He.
Ipomoea aquatica|spinach|Ipomoea aquatica is most commonly grown in east, south, and southeast Asia
Ipomoea aquatica|spinach|It flourishes naturally in waterways, and requires little if any care
Ipomoea aquatica|spinach|It is used extensively in Indonesian, Burmese, Thai, Lao, Cambodian, Malay, Vietnamese, Filipino, and Chinese cuisine, especially in rural or kampung (village) areas
Ipomoea aquatica|spinach|The vegetable is also extremely popular in Taiwan, where it grows well
Ipomoea aquatica|spinach|During the Japanese occupation of Singapore in World War II, the vegetable grew remarkably easily in many areas, and became a popular wartime crop
Ipomoea aquatica|spinach|Water spinach has been found to be cultivated in the following countries
Ipomoea aquatica|spinach|In the United States it is cultivated in California, Florida, Hawaii, Texas, Arizona, and the U.S
Ipomoea aquatica|spinach|Virgin Islands
Ipomoea aquatica|spinach|It is also considered native to Africa and in its wild form, for example, is collected and used by the Sambaa people in Tanzania.Water spinach is also potentially suitable for cultivation in greenhouses in more temperate regions.In non-tropical areas, it is easily grown in containers given enough water in a bright sunny location
Ipomoea aquatica|spinach|It readily roots from cuttings.
Ipomoea aquatica|spinach|Water spinach is ideal for sub-tropical and tropical climate, as it does not grow well below 23.9 °C (75.0 °F) and is sensitive to frost
Ipomoea aquatica|spinach|High soil moisture is beneficial for the growth
Ipomoea aquatica|spinach|Clay soils and marshy soils rich in organic matter are suitable for water spinach
Ipomoea aquatica|spinach|The ideal pH range for the growth is from 5 to 7
Ipomoea aquatica|spinach|The provision of shade has been shown to have a positive influence on the yield of water spinach.
Ipomoea aquatica|spinach|Water spinach is cultivated in a variety of systems
Ipomoea aquatica|spinach|In Hong Kong, two methods are traditionally used
Ipomoea aquatica|spinach|the dryland method and the wetland method.
Ipomoea aquatica|spinach|In the dryland method, water spinach is grown on raised beds which are separated by irrigation ditches
Ipomoea aquatica|spinach|The seeds can be sown directly onto the beds
Ipomoea aquatica|spinach|Alternatively, a nursery may be used and the seedlings are transplanted when they reach a sufficient size
Ipomoea aquatica|spinach|In either case, the distance between the plants should be about 12 centimetres (4.7 in) by the time they are 15 centimetres (5.9 in) tall
Ipomoea aquatica|spinach|Regular irrigation is crucial in the dryland system and so is a sufficient fertilization
Ipomoea aquatica|spinach|Water spinach cultivated with the dryland method is ready for harvest 50 to 60 days after sowing
Ipomoea aquatica|spinach|Harvesting is being done by pulling up the whole plant.The wetland method is the traditionally more common and important method for cultivation in Hong Kong
Ipomoea aquatica|spinach|In the wetland method, water spinach is cultivated on flat fields surrounded by raised banks, which have oftentimes been used as rice paddies in the past
Ipomoea aquatica|spinach|These former rice paddies have a heavy clay soil with an iron-pan
Ipomoea aquatica|spinach|This helps to retain water for the water spinach
Ipomoea aquatica|spinach|The seedlings to be used in this methods are usually grown in a nursery on a dry field, as the germination under water is quite poor
Ipomoea aquatica|spinach|Six weeks after sowing the seedlings, cuttings for transplantation can be taken from them
Ipomoea aquatica|spinach|One cutting is an approximately 30 centimetres (12 in) long cut from the stem containing seven or eight nodes
Ipomoea aquatica|spinach|This is then planted in the field with a spacing of about 40 centimetres (16 in)
Ipomoea aquatica|spinach|The field is beforehand prepared by flooding it to a depth of 3 to 5 centimetres (1.2 to 2.0 in)
Ipomoea aquatica|spinach|The soil itself is tramped into a liquid mud so that the cuttings can root easily
Ipomoea aquatica|spinach|Once the plants are established, the depth of the flooding is increased to 15 to 20 centimetres (5.9 to 7.9 in)
Ipomoea aquatica|spinach|The first harvest in the wetland method can usually be done at around 30 days after the transplantation
Ipomoea aquatica|spinach|Also, the harvesting differs from the dryland system
Ipomoea aquatica|spinach|In the wetland, the upper part of the main shoot is cut at about water level
Ipomoea aquatica|spinach|This stimulates lateral growth and produces horizontal shoots carrying vertical branches
Ipomoea aquatica|spinach|After the first harvests, every seven to ten days throughout the summer, these vertical branches can be harvested
Ipomoea aquatica|spinach|After the planting period, the fields are drained and once the fruit of the water spinach is ripe, it is harvested, dried, then trodden to release the seeds which are to be used for the following season.
Ipomoea aquatica|spinach|How much fertilizer is used for the cultivation strongly depends on the region
Ipomoea aquatica|spinach|Most research is from the '80s and '90s
Ipomoea aquatica|spinach|Generally, it has been shown that a dose of 60 kilograms (130 lb) N/ha is sufficient and that the application of K can be beneficial on the yield
Ipomoea aquatica|spinach|Also, the application of plant growth regulators, for example Adenine and Zetanine, has been found to be an effective means to promote water spinach growth
Ipomoea aquatica|spinach|One study has determined, that the highest yields are produced with the application of 60 kg/ha of N, 90 kg/ha of P2O5 and 50 kg/ha of K2O for the first harvest
Ipomoea aquatica|spinach|For the second harvest the optimal fertilization was determined as 120 kg/ha of N, 45 kg/ha of P2O5 and 100 kg/ha of K2O.Taiwan
Ipomoea aquatica|spinach|In Taiwan the usual fertilization includes the basic application of about 10 t/ha of cowdung followed by 50 kg/ha of ammonium sulfate after each harvest.Bangkok
Ipomoea aquatica|spinach|In Bangkok it is common to apply about 300 kg/ha of NPK fertilizer twice a month.Indonesia
Ipomoea aquatica|spinach|In Indonesia, usually 150 kg to 300 kg of NPK are applied per hectare.
Ipomoea aquatica|spinach|There are several pathogens and pests reported, affecting I
Ipomoea aquatica|spinach|aquatica
Ipomoea aquatica|spinach|Pythium causes problems like damping-off, Cercospora leaf spot and root nematodes
Ipomoea aquatica|spinach|Also, aphids may be problems in fields
Ipomoea aquatica|spinach|Additionally, there are several polyphagous insects feeding on I

Ipomoea aquatica|spinach|A specialist pathogen on I
Ipomoea aquatica|spinach|aquatica is the oomycete Albugo ipomoeae-aquaticae, though its range is restricted to southern and southeast Asia.
Ipomoea aquatica|spinach|Ipomoea aquatica is listed by the USDA as a noxious weed, especially in the states of Florida, California, and Hawaii, where it can be observed growing in the wild
Ipomoea aquatica|spinach|In the US, water spinach has mainly become a problem in Florida; why is unclear although the fast growth rate has been cited as a threat to native plants in certain areas of Florida
Ipomoea aquatica|spinach|It could be owing to the time since introduction, or owing to climatic factors
Ipomoea aquatica|spinach|I
Ipomoea aquatica|spinach|aquatica has been extensively cultivated in Texas for over 30 years, having been originally brought there by Asian immigrants
Ipomoea aquatica|spinach|Because no evidence indicates the plant has escaped into the wild, Texas lifted its ban on cultivation for personal use with no restrictions or requirements, noting its importance as a vegetable in many cultures, and also began permitting cultivation for commercial sales with the requirement of an exotic species permit
Ipomoea aquatica|spinach|Possession of I
Ipomoea aquatica|spinach|aquatica has been prohibited in Florida since 1973, but it is still being grown and sold illegally
Ipomoea aquatica|spinach|Some of the infestations in Florida public lakes have been eradicated, or at least attempts have been made
Ipomoea aquatica|spinach|In Sri Lanka it invades wetlands, where its long, floating stems form dense mats which can block the flow of water and prevent the passage of boats.
Ipomoea aquatica|spinach|The vegetable is a common ingredient in East, South and Southeast Asian dishes, such as in stir-fried water spinach
Ipomoea aquatica|spinach|In Singapore, Indonesia, and Malaysia, the tender shoots along with the leaves are usually stir-fried with chili pepper, garlic, ginger, dried shrimp paste (belacan/terasi) and other spices
Ipomoea aquatica|spinach|In Penang and Ipoh, it is cooked with cuttlefish and a sweet and spicy sauce
Ipomoea aquatica|spinach|Also known as eng chhai in the Hokkien dialect, it can also be boiled with preserved cuttlefish, then rinsed and mixed with spicy rojak paste to become jiu hu eng chhai
Ipomoea aquatica|spinach|Boiled eng chhai also can be served with fermented krill noodle belacan bihun and prawn mi.In Indonesian cuisine it is called kangkung, boiled or blanched together with other vegetables it forms the ingredient of gado-gado or pecel salads in peanut sauce
Ipomoea aquatica|spinach|Some recipes that use kangkung is plecing kangkung from Lombok, and mie kangkung (kangkong noodle) from Jakarta.
Ipomoea aquatica|spinach|In Thailand, where it is called phak bung (Thai
Ipomoea aquatica|spinach|ผักบุ้ง), it is eaten raw, often along with green papaya salad or nam phrik, in stir-fries and in curries such as kaeng som.In the Philippines, where it is called kangkóng, the tender shoots are cut into segments and cooked, together with the leaves, in fish and meat stews, such as sinigang
Ipomoea aquatica|spinach|The vegetable is also commonly eaten alone
Ipomoea aquatica|spinach|In adobong kangkóng (also called apan-apan), it is sautéed in cooking oil, onions, garlic, vinegar, and soy sauce
Ipomoea aquatica|spinach|In ensaladang kangkóng (or kinilaw na kangkóng), it is blanched and served in vinegar or calamansi juice and fresh tomatoes and onions with salt and pepper to taste
Ipomoea aquatica|spinach|In binagoongang kangkóng (or ginisang kangkóng), it is sautéed with garlic and topped with bagoong alamang (shrimp paste) or bagoong isda (fermented fish) and sliced fresh tomatoes and onions, commonly also with cubed crispy liempo (pork belly) or pork adobo
Ipomoea aquatica|spinach|It can also be spiced with siling haba or siling labuyo peppers, soy sauce, black pepper, and sugar
Ipomoea aquatica|spinach|It differs from adobong kangkóng in that it does not use vinegar
Ipomoea aquatica|spinach|A local appetiser called crispy kangkóng has the leaves coated in a flour-based batter and fried until crisp, similar to Japanese vegetable tempura.
Ipomoea aquatica|spinach|Using aquatic macrophytes to remove nutrients from wastewater and to control freshwater eutrophication has been reported to be a feasible way of phytoremediation

Kale|spinach|Kale (), or leaf cabbage, belongs to a group of cabbage (Brassica oleracea) cultivars  grown for their edible leaves, although some are used as ornamentals
Kale|spinach|Kale plants have green or purple leaves, and the central leaves do not form a head (as with headed cabbage)
Kale|spinach|Kales are considered to be closer to wild cabbage than most of the many domesticated forms of Brassica oleracea.
Kale|spinach|Kale originates from Northern Middle English cale (compare Scots kail) for various cabbages
Kale|spinach|The ultimate origin is Latin caulis 'cabbage'.
Kale|spinach|Kale originated in the eastern Mediterranean and Asia Minor, where it was cultivated for food beginning by 2000 BCE at the latest
Kale|spinach|Curly-leaved varieties of cabbage already existed along with flat-leaved varieties in Greece in the 4th century BC
Kale|spinach|These forms, which were referred to by the Romans as Sabellian kale, are considered to be the ancestors of modern kales.
Kale|spinach|The earliest record of cabbages in western Europe is of hard-heading cabbage in the 13th century
Kale|spinach|Records in 14th-century England distinguish between hard-heading cabbage and loose-leaf kale.Russian kale was introduced into Canada, and then into the United States, by Russian traders in the 19th century
Kale|spinach|USDA botanist David Fairchild is credited with introducing kale (and many other crops) to Americans, having brought it back from Croatia, although Fairchild himself disliked cabbages, including kale
Kale|spinach|At the time, kale was widely grown in Croatia mostly because it was easy to grow and inexpensive, and could desalinate soil
Kale|spinach|For most of the twentieth century, kale was primarily used in the United States for decorative purposes; it became more popular as an edible vegetable in the 1990s due to its nutritional value.During World War II, the cultivation of kale (and other vegetables) in the U.K
Kale|spinach|was encouraged by the Dig for Victory campaign
Kale|spinach|The vegetable was easy to grow and provided important nutrients missing from a diet because of rationing.
Kale|spinach|Kale is usually an annual plant grown from seed with a wide range of germination temperatures
Kale|spinach|It is hardy and thrives in wintertime, and can survive in temperatures as low as –15.0° Celsius
Kale|spinach|Kale can become sweeter in taste after a heavy frost.
Kale|spinach|One may differentiate between kale varieties according to the low, intermediate, or high length of the stem, along with the variety of leaf types
Kale|spinach|The leaf colours range from light green to green, to dark green and violet-green, to violet-brown.
Kale|spinach|"Because kale can grow well into winter, one variety of rape kale is called ""hungry gap"" after the period in winter in traditional agriculture when little else could be harvested"
Kale|spinach|An extra-tall variety is known as Jersey kale or cow cabbage
Kale|spinach|Kai-lan or Chinese kale is a cultivar often used in Chinese cuisine
Kale|spinach|"In Portugal, the bumpy-leaved kale is mostly called ""couve galega"" (Galician kale or Portuguese Cabbage)."
Kale|spinach|Many varieties of kale and cabbage are grown mainly for ornamental leaves that are brilliant white, red, pink, lavender, blue or violet in the interior of the rosette
Kale|spinach|The different types of ornamental kale are peacock kale, coral prince, kamone coral queen, color up kale and chidori kale
Kale|spinach|Ornamental kale is as edible as any other variety, but potentially not as palatable
Kale|spinach|Kale leaves are increasingly used as an ingredient for vegetable bouquets and wedding bouquets.
Kale|spinach|Raw kale is composed of 84% water, 9% carbohydrates, 4% protein, and 1% fat (table)
Kale|spinach|In a 100 g (3+1⁄2 oz) serving, raw kale provides 207 kilojoules (49 kilocalories) of food energy and a large amount of vitamin K at 3.7 times the Daily Value (DV) (table)
Kale|spinach|"It is a rich source (20% or more of the DV) of vitamin A, vitamin C, vitamin B6, folate, and manganese (see table ""Kale, raw"")"
Kale|spinach|"Kale is a good source (10–19% DV) of thiamin, riboflavin, pantothenic acid, vitamin E and several dietary minerals, including iron, calcium, magnesium, potassium, and phosphorus (see table ""Kale, raw"")"
Kale|spinach|"Boiling raw kale diminishes most of these nutrients, while values for vitamins A, C, and K, and manganese remain substantial (see table ""Kale, cooked"")."
Kale|spinach|Kale is a source of the carotenoids, lutein and zeaxanthin (tables)
Kale|spinach|As with broccoli and other cruciferous vegetables, kale contains glucosinolate compounds, such as glucoraphanin, which contributes to the formation of sulforaphane, a compound under preliminary research for its potential to affect human health beneficially.Boiling kale decreases the level of glucosinate compounds, whereas steaming, microwaving or stir frying does not cause significant loss
Kale|spinach|Kale is high in oxalic acid, the levels of which can be reduced by cooking.Kale contains high levels of polyphenols, such as ferulic acid, with levels varying due to environmental and genetic factors.
Kale|spinach|"In the Netherlands, a traditional winter dish called ""boerenkoolstamppot"" is a mix of curly kale and mashed potatoes, sometimes with fried bacon, and served with rookworst (""smoked sausage"").In Northern Germany, there is a winter tradition known as ""Kohlfahrt"" (""kale trip""), where a group of people will go on a hike through the woods during the day before gathering at an inn or private residence where kale is served, usually with bacon and Kohlwurst (""kale sausage"")"
Kale|spinach|Kale is considered a Northern German staple and comfort food.In Italy, cavolo nero kale is an ingredient of the Tuscan soup ribollita.A traditional Portuguese soup, caldo verde, combines pureed potatoes, very finely sliced kale, olive oil and salt
Kale|spinach|Additional ingredients can include broth and sliced, cooked spicy sausage.
Kale|spinach|In Scotland, kale provided such a base for a traditional diet that the word in some Scots dialects is synonymous with food
Kale|spinach|"To be ""off one's kail"" is to feel too ill to eat.In Ireland, kale is mixed with mashed potatoes to make the traditional dish colcannon"
Kale|spinach|It is popular on Halloween, when it may be served with sausages.
Kale|spinach|In Sri Lanka, It is known as 'kola gova' or ela gova
Kale|spinach|It is cultivated for edible use
Kale|spinach|A dish called 'kale mallung' is served almost everywhere in the island along with rice.
Kale|spinach|The Kailyard school of Scottish writers, which included J
Kale|spinach|M
Kale|spinach|Barrie (creator of Peter Pan), consisted of authors who wrote about traditional rural Scottish life (kailyard = 'kale field')
Kale|spinach|In Cuthbertson's book Autumn in Kyle and the charm of Cunninghame, he states that Kilmaurs in East Ayrshire was famous for its kale, which was an important foodstuff
Kale|spinach|A story is told in which a neighbouring village offered to pay a generous price for some kale seeds, an offer too good to turn down
Kale|spinach|The locals agreed, but a gentle roasting on a shovel over a coal fire ensured that the seeds never germinated.
Atriplex hortensis|spinach|Atriplex hortensis, known as garden orache, red orache or simply orache (; also spelled orach), mountain spinach, French spinach, or arrach, is a species of plant in the amaranth family used as a leaf vegetable that was common before spinach and still grown as a warm-weather alternative to that crop
Atriplex hortensis|spinach|(For many years, it was classified in the goosefoot family, but it has now been absorbed into the Amaranthaceae.) It is Eurasian, native to Asia and Europe, and widely naturalized in Canada, the United States, Australia, and New Zealand.
Atriplex hortensis|spinach|Atriplex hortensis is a hardy annual plant, with an erect, branching stem
Atriplex hortensis|spinach|It varies in height from two to six feet, according to the variety and soil
Atriplex hortensis|spinach|The leaves are variously shaped, but somewhat oblong, comparatively thin, and slightly acidic to the taste
Atriplex hortensis|spinach|The flowers are small and obscure, greenish or reddish, corresponding to a degree with the color of the foliage of the plant
Atriplex hortensis|spinach|The seeds are small, black, surrounded by a thin, pale-yellow membrane, and they retain their viability for three years
Atriplex hortensis|spinach|There are varieties with red, white and green leaves.
Atriplex hortensis|spinach|Atriplex hortensis has a salty, spinach-like taste
Atriplex hortensis|spinach|The leaves are used cooked or raw in salads
Atriplex hortensis|spinach|The green leaves were once used to color pasta in Italy
Atriplex hortensis|spinach|A common use of the plant is to balance out the acidic flavor of sorrel.It was commonly grown in Mediterranean regions from early times, until spinach became the more favored leaf vegetable
Atriplex hortensis|spinach|It is commonly grown as a warm-weather alternative to spinach because it is more tolerant of heat and slower to bolt in warm weather.
Amaranthus palmeri|spinach|Amaranthus palmeri is a species of edible flowering plant in the amaranth genus
Amaranthus palmeri|spinach|It has several common names, including carelessweed, dioecious amaranth, Palmer's amaranth, Palmer amaranth, and Palmer's pigweed.
Amaranthus palmeri|spinach|It is native to most of the southern half of North America
Amaranthus palmeri|spinach|Populations in the eastern United States are probably naturalized
Amaranthus palmeri|spinach|It has also been introduced to Europe, Australia, and other areas
Amaranthus palmeri|spinach|The plant is fast-growing and highly competitive.
Amaranthus palmeri|spinach|The leaves, stems and seeds of Palmer amaranth, like those of other amaranths, are edible and highly nutritious
Amaranthus palmeri|spinach|Palmer amaranth was once widely cultivated and eaten by Native Americans across North America, both for its abundant seeds and as a cooked or dried green vegetable
Amaranthus palmeri|spinach|Other related Amaranthus species have been grown as crops for their greens and seeds for thousands of years in Mexico, South America, the Caribbean, Africa, India, and China.
Amaranthus palmeri|spinach|The plant can be toxic to livestock animals due to the presence of nitrates in the leaves
Amaranthus palmeri|spinach|Palmer amaranth has a tendency to absorb excess soil nitrogen, and if grown in overly fertilized soils, it can contain excessive levels of nitrates, even for humans
Amaranthus palmeri|spinach|Like spinach and many other leafy greens, amaranth leaves also contain oxalic acid, which can be harmful to individuals with kidney problems if consumed in excess.Because of its toxicity to livestock, and scarce familiarity in the United States with the uses of amaranths as food, Palmer amaranth is rarely consumed as of 2020, despite its ubiquity and resistance to drought
Amaranthus palmeri|spinach|Unlike the grain and leaf amaranths of other regions, it has not been cultivated or further improved by recent agricultural breeding
Amaranthus palmeri|spinach|As a result, the primary economic importance of Palmer amaranth to American farmers has been as a noxious weed and a competitor to more marketable crops, rather than as a crop in its own right.
Amaranthus palmeri|spinach|Palmer amaranth is considered a threat most specifically to the production of cotton and soybean crops in the southern United States
Amaranthus palmeri|spinach|In 2001, Palmer amaranth was found in the southern quarter of Illinois and appeared to be moving to northern Illinois in 2006.
Amaranthus palmeri|spinach|In many places, the plant has developed resistance since at least 2006 to glyphosate, a widely used broad-spectrum herbicide
Amaranthus palmeri|spinach|Glyphosate-resistant pigweed not only dominates in cotton fields, but also has wide-ranging effects on other crops and productions.In 2014, the Texas Department of Agriculture asked the United States Environmental Protection Agency for permission to use the restricted chemical propazine on 3 million acres (1.2 million hectares) of cotton threatened by Palmer amaranth
Amaranthus palmeri|spinach|(The request was denied due to unacceptable risks to drinking water.)In 2019, Kansas State University researchers documented a population of Palmer amaranth with resistance to 2,4-D and Dicamba in Kansas
Amaranthus palmeri|spinach|Previously, Palmer amaranth in Kansas has developed resistance to ALS, atrazine, glyphosate and HPPD herbicides—mesotrione, Huskie, Laudis, Impact, and Armezon—leaving growers with very few postemergence options to manage this weed.An Arkansas population has developed fomesafen resistance.Gene drive technologies could provide a countermeasure
Amaranthus palmeri|spinach|A gene drive agent could engineer A
Amaranthus palmeri|spinach|palmeri to become glyphosate-sensitive again
Amaranthus palmeri|spinach|Such a wide-ranging application of the technology should be carefully considered however.
Amaranthus palmeri|spinach|Palmer amaranth may be the most aggressive pigweed species with respect to growth rate and competitive ability
Amaranthus palmeri|spinach|Palmer amaranth in particular is highly competitive
Amaranthus palmeri|spinach|It will outgrow cotton and is much more efficient
Amaranthus palmeri|spinach|Growers of crops have not been able to provide adequate moisture to offset prolonged temperatures above 85 °F (29 °C) with a 112 °F (44 °C) heat index
Amaranthus palmeri|spinach|In these conditions, many herbicides break down over time and Palmer amaranth will keep growing
Amaranthus palmeri|spinach|It can grow from 2 to 5 inches (51 to 127 mm) in three days, or less
Amaranthus palmeri|spinach|In only a few weeks, it can grow from 12 to 18 inches (300 to 460 mm) compared to cotton at 5 to 8 inches (130 to 200 mm).
Amaranthus palmeri|spinach|Pollen is most commonly spread by wind
Amaranthus palmeri|spinach|The male produces the pollen and the female plant produces the seed
Amaranthus palmeri|spinach|The wind carries the pollen from resistant male plants to female plants
Amaranthus palmeri|spinach|"In addition, the seed is spread by traditional means, such as harvesting, inadequate cleaning of equipment, and the spreading of infested materials, such as manure.In 2014, North Dakota State University's ""ND Weed Control Guide"" selected Amaranthus palmeri, as ""weed-of-the-year"" to raise awareness about its ""potentially devastating impact."""
Amaranthus palmeri|spinach|"5  In 2015, Palmer amaranth was chosen as ""weed-of-the-year"" for the second year in a row as a ""proactive approach to prevent Palmer amaranth establishment in North Dakota."" As alien, this species was first found in South Africa in March 2018 with further records in different regions of the country as well as in northern Botswana in March 2020"
Amaranthus palmeri|spinach|It is considered as naturalized weed which invades both ruderal and segetal (growing in cornfields) plant communities.

United States|spinach|The United States emerged from the thirteen British colonies established along the East Coast
United States|spinach|Disputes with Great Britain over taxation and political representation led to the American Revolutionary War (1775–1783), which established the nation's independence
United States|spinach|In the late 18th century, the U.S
United States|spinach|began expanding across North America, gradually obtaining new territories, sometimes through war, frequently displacing Native Americans, and admitting new states; by 1848, the United States spanned the continent
United States|spinach|Slavery was legal in the southern United States until the second half of the 19th century, when the American Civil War led to its abolition
United States|spinach|The Spanish–American War and World War I established the U.S
United States|spinach|as a world power, a status confirmed by the outcome of World War II
United States|spinach|During the Cold War, the United States fought the Korean War and the Vietnam War but avoided direct military conflict with the Soviet Union
United States|spinach|The two superpowers competed in the Space Race, culminating in the 1969 spaceflight that first landed humans on the Moon
United States|spinach|The Soviet Union's dissolution in 1991 ended the Cold War, leaving the United States as the world's sole superpower.
United States|spinach|The United States is a federal republic and a representative democracy with three separate branches of government, including a bicameral legislature
United States|spinach|It is a founding member of the United Nations, World Bank, International Monetary Fund, Organization of American States, NATO, and other international organizations
United States|spinach|It is a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council

United States|spinach|The U.S
United States|spinach|ranks high in international measures of economic freedom, quality of life, education, and human rights; it has low levels of perceived corruption
United States|spinach|However, the country has been criticized for inequality related to race, wealth, and income; use of capital punishment; high incarceration rates; and lack of universal health care.
United States|spinach|The United States is a highly developed country, accounts for approximately a quarter of global GDP, and is the world's largest economy by GDP at market exchange rates
United States|spinach|By value, the United States is the world's largest importer and second-largest exporter of goods
United States|spinach|Although its population is only 4.2% of the world's total, it holds 29.4% of the total wealth in the world, the largest share held by any country

United States|spinach|"The first known use of the name ""America"" dates back to 1507, when it appeared on a world map produced by the German cartographer Martin Waldseemüller"
United States|spinach|On his map, the name is shown in large letters on what would now be considered South America, in honor of Amerigo Vespucci
United States|spinach|The Italian explorer was the first to postulate that the West Indies did not represent Asia's eastern limit but were part of a previously unknown landmass
United States|spinach|"In 1538, the Flemish cartographer Gerardus Mercator used the name ""America"" on his own world map, applying it to the entire Western Hemisphere.The first documentary evidence of the phrase ""United States of America"" dates from a January 2, 1776 letter written by Stephen Moylan to George Washington's aide-de-camp Joseph Reed"
United States|spinach|"Moylan expressed his wish to go ""with full and ample powers from the United States of America to Spain"" to seek assistance in the revolutionary war effort"
United States|spinach|"The first known publication of the phrase ""United States of America"" was in an anonymous essay in The Virginia Gazette newspaper in Williamsburg, on April 6, 1776.The second draft of the Articles of Confederation, prepared by John Dickinson and completed no later than June 17, 1776, declared ""The name of this Confederation shall be the 'United States of America'."" The final version of the Articles, sent to the states for ratification in late 1777, stated that ""The Stile of this Confederacy shall be 'The United States of America'."" In June 1776, Thomas Jefferson wrote the phrase ""UNITED STATES OF AMERICA"" in all capitalized letters in the headline of his ""original Rough draught"" of the Declaration of Independence"
United States|spinach|"This draft of the document did not surface until June 21, 1776, and it is unclear whether it was written before or after Dickinson used the term in his June 17 draft of the Articles of Confederation.The short form ""United States"" is also standard"
United States|spinach|"Other common forms are the ""U.S."", the ""USA"", and ""America"""
United States|spinach|"Colloquial names are the ""U.S"
United States|spinach|"of A."" and, internationally, the ""States"""
United States|spinach|"""Columbia"", a name popular in American poetry and songs of the late 18th century, derives its origin from Christopher Columbus; both ""Columbus"" and ""Columbia"" appear frequently in U.S"
United States|spinach|place-names, including Columbus, Ohio, Columbia, South Carolina, and the District of Columbia
United States|spinach|Places and institutions throughout the Western Hemisphere bear the two names, including Colón, Panama, the country of Colombia, the Columbia River, and Columbia University.
United States|spinach|"The phrase ""United States"" was originally plural in American usage"
United States|spinach|"It described a collection of states—e.g., ""the United States are."" The singular form became popular after the end of the Civil War and is now standard usage in the U.S"
United States|spinach|"A citizen of the United States is an ""American"""
United States|spinach|"""United States"", ""American"" and ""U.S."" refer to the country adjectivally (""American values"", ""U.S"

United States|spinach|"In English, the word ""American"" rarely refers to topics or subjects not directly connected with the United States."
United States|spinach|It has been generally accepted that the first inhabitants of North America migrated from Siberia by way of the Bering land bridge and arrived at least 12,000 years ago; however, some evidence suggests an even earlier date of arrival
United States|spinach|The Clovis culture, which appeared around 11,000 BC, is believed to represent the first wave of human settlement of the Americas
United States|spinach|This was likely the first of three major waves of migration into North America; later waves brought the ancestors of present-day Athabaskans, Aleuts, and Eskimos.Over time, indigenous cultures in North America grew increasingly complex, and some, such as the pre-Columbian Mississippian culture in the southeast, developed advanced agriculture, architecture, and complex societies
United States|spinach|The city-state of Cahokia is the largest, most complex pre-Columbian archaeological site in the modern-day United States
United States|spinach|In the Four Corners region, Ancestral Puebloan culture developed from centuries of agricultural experimentation
United States|spinach|The Haudenosaunee, located in the southern Great Lakes region, was established at some point between the twelfth and fifteenth centuries
United States|spinach|Most prominent along the Atlantic coast were the Algonquian tribes, who practiced hunting and trapping, along with limited cultivation.
United States|spinach|Estimating the native population of North America at the time of European contact is difficult
United States|spinach|Douglas H
United States|spinach|Ubelaker of the Smithsonian Institution estimated that there was a population of 92,916 in the south Atlantic states and a population of 473,616 in the Gulf states, but most academics regard this figure as too low
United States|spinach|Anthropologist Henry F
United States|spinach|Dobyns believed the populations were much higher, suggesting around 1.1 million along the shores of the Gulf of Mexico, 2.2 million people living between Florida and Massachusetts, 5.2 million in the Mississippi Valley and tributaries, and around 700,000 people in the Florida peninsula.
United States|spinach|Claims of very early colonization of coastal New England by the Norse are disputed and controversial
United States|spinach|The first documented arrival of Europeans in the continental United States is that of Spanish conquistadors such as Juan Ponce de León, who made his first expedition to Florida in 1513
United States|spinach|Even earlier, Christopher Columbus had landed in Puerto Rico on his 1493 voyage, and San Juan was settled by the Spanish a decade later
United States|spinach|The Spanish set up the first settlements in Florida and New Mexico, such as Saint Augustine, often considered the nation's oldest city, and Santa Fe
United States|spinach|The French established their own settlements along the Mississippi River, notably New Orleans
United States|spinach|Successful English settlement of the eastern coast of North America began with the Virginia Colony in 1607 at Jamestown and with the Pilgrims' colony at Plymouth in 1620
United States|spinach|The continent's first elected legislative assembly, Virginia's House of Burgesses, was founded in 1619
United States|spinach|Documents such as the Mayflower Compact and the Fundamental Orders of Connecticut established precedents for representative self-government and constitutionalism that would develop throughout the American colonies
United States|spinach|Many English settlers were dissenting Christians who came seeking religious freedom
United States|spinach|In 1784, the Russians were the first Europeans to establish a settlement in Alaska, at Three Saints Bay
United States|spinach|Russian America once spanned much of the present-day state of Alaska.In the early days of colonization, many European settlers were subject to food shortages, disease, and attacks from Native Americans
United States|spinach|Native Americans were also often at war with neighboring tribes and European settlers
United States|spinach|In many cases, however, the natives and settlers came to depend on one another
United States|spinach|Settlers traded for food and animal pelts; natives for guns, tools and other European goods
United States|spinach|Natives taught many settlers to cultivate corn, beans, and other foodstuffs
United States|spinach|"European missionaries and others felt it was important to ""civilize"" the Native Americans and urged them to adopt European agricultural practices and lifestyles"
United States|spinach|However, with the increased European colonization of North America, the Native Americans were displaced and often killed
United States|spinach|The native population of America declined after European arrival for various reasons, primarily diseases such as smallpox and measles.
United States|spinach|European settlers also began trafficking of African slaves into Colonial America via the transatlantic slave trade
United States|spinach|Because of a lower prevalence of tropical diseases and better treatment, slaves had a much higher life expectancy in North America than in South America, leading to a rapid increase in their numbers
United States|spinach|Colonial society was largely divided over the religious and moral implications of slavery, and several colonies passed acts both against and in favor of the practice
United States|spinach|However, by the turn of the 18th century, African slaves had supplanted European indentured servants as cash crop labor, especially in the American South.The Thirteen Colonies (New Hampshire, Massachusetts, Connecticut, Rhode Island, New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Delaware, Maryland, Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, and Georgia) that would become the United States of America were administered by the British as overseas dependencies
United States|spinach|All nonetheless had local governments with elections open to most free men
United States|spinach|With extremely high birth rates, low death rates, and steady settlement, the colonial population grew rapidly, eclipsing Native American populations
United States|spinach|The Christian revivalist movement of the 1730s and 1740s known as the Great Awakening fueled interest both in religion and in religious liberty.During the Seven Years' War (1756–1763), known in the U.S
United States|spinach|as the French and Indian War, British forces captured Canada from the French
United States|spinach|With the creation of the Province of Quebec, Canada's francophone population would remain isolated from the English-speaking colonial dependencies of Nova Scotia, Newfoundland and the Thirteen Colonies
United States|spinach|Excluding the Native Americans who lived there, the Thirteen Colonies had a population of over 2.1 million in 1770, about a third that of Britain
United States|spinach|Despite continuing new arrivals, the rate of natural increase was such that by the 1770s only a small minority of Americans had been born overseas
United States|spinach|The colonies' distance from Britain had allowed the development of self-government, but their unprecedented success motivated British monarchs to periodically seek to reassert royal authority.
United States|spinach|The American Revolutionary War fought by the Thirteen Colonies against the British Empire was the first successful war of independence by a non-European entity against a European power in modern history
United States|spinach|"Americans had developed an ideology of ""republicanism"", asserting that government rested on the will of the people as expressed in their local legislatures"
United States|spinach|"They demanded their ""rights as Englishmen"" and ""no taxation without representation"""
United States|spinach|The British insisted on administering the empire through Parliament, and the conflict escalated into war.The Second Continental Congress unanimously adopted the Declaration of Independence on July 4, 1776; this day is celebrated annually as Independence Day
United States|spinach|In 1777, the Articles of Confederation established a decentralized government that operated until 1789.After its defeat at the Siege of Yorktown in 1781, Britain signed a peace treaty
United States|spinach|American sovereignty became internationally recognized, and the country was granted all lands east of the Mississippi River
United States|spinach|Tensions with Britain remained, however, leading to the War of 1812, which was fought to a draw
United States|spinach|Nationalists led the Philadelphia Convention of 1787 in writing the United States Constitution, ratified in state conventions in 1788
United States|spinach|Going into force in 1789, this constitution reorganized the federal government into three branches, on the principle of creating salutary checks and balances
United States|spinach|George Washington, who had led the Continental Army to victory, was the first president elected under the new constitution
United States|spinach|The Bill of Rights, forbidding federal restriction of personal freedoms and guaranteeing a range of legal protections, was adopted in 1791.
United States|spinach|Although the federal government outlawed American participation in the Atlantic slave trade in 1807, after 1820, cultivation of the highly profitable cotton crop exploded in the Deep South, and along with it, the slave population
United States|spinach|The Second Great Awakening, especially in the period 1800–1840, converted millions to evangelical Protestantism
United States|spinach|In the North, it energized multiple social reform movements, including abolitionism; in the South, Methodists and Baptists proselytized among slave populations.Beginning in the late 18th century, American settlers began to expand westward, prompting a long series of American Indian Wars
United States|spinach|The 1803 Louisiana Purchase almost doubled the nation's area, Spain ceded Florida and other Gulf Coast territory in 1819, the Republic of Texas was annexed in 1845 during a period of expansionism, and the 1846 Oregon Treaty with Britain led to U.S
United States|spinach|control of the present-day American Northwest
United States|spinach|Victory in the Mexican–American War resulted in the 1848 Mexican Cession of California and much of the present-day American Southwest, making the U.S
United States|spinach|span the continent.The California Gold Rush of 1848–1849 spurred migration to the Pacific coast, which led to the California Genocide and the creation of additional western states
United States|spinach|The giving away of vast quantities of land to white European settlers as part of the Homestead Acts, nearly 10% of the total area of the United States, and to private railroad companies and colleges as part of land grants spurred economic development
United States|spinach|After the Civil War, new transcontinental railways made relocation easier for settlers, expanded internal trade, and increased conflicts with Native Americans
United States|spinach|In 1869, a new Peace Policy nominally promised to protect Native Americans from abuses, avoid further war, and secure their eventual U.S
United States|spinach|citizenship
United States|spinach|Nonetheless, large-scale conflicts continued throughout the West into the 1900s.
United States|spinach|Irreconcilable sectional conflict regarding the enslavement of Africans and African Americans ultimately led to the American Civil War
United States|spinach|"With the 1860 election of Republican Abraham Lincoln, conventions in thirteen slave states declared secession and formed the Confederate States of America (the ""South"" or the ""Confederacy""), while the federal government (the ""Union"") maintained that secession was illegal"
United States|spinach|In order to bring about this secession, military action was initiated by the secessionists, and the Union responded in kind
United States|spinach|The ensuing war would become the deadliest military conflict in American history, resulting in the deaths of approximately 618,000 soldiers as well as many civilians
United States|spinach|The Union initially simply fought to keep the country united
United States|spinach|Nevertheless, as casualties mounted after 1863 and Lincoln delivered his Emancipation Proclamation, the main purpose of the war from the Union's viewpoint became the abolition of slavery
United States|spinach|Indeed, when the Union ultimately won the war in April 1865, each of the states in the defeated South was required to ratify the Thirteenth Amendment, which prohibited slavery except as penal labor
United States|spinach|Two other amendments were also ratified, ensuring citizenship for blacks and, at least in theory, voting rights for them as well.
United States|spinach|Reconstruction began in earnest following the war
United States|spinach|While President Lincoln attempted to foster friendship and forgiveness between the Union and the former Confederacy, his assassination on April 14, 1865 drove a wedge between North and South again
United States|spinach|Republicans in the federal government made it their goal to oversee the rebuilding of the South and to ensure the rights of African Americans
United States|spinach|They persisted until the Compromise of 1877 when the Republicans agreed to cease protecting the rights of African Americans in the South in order for Democrats to concede the presidential election of 1876.
United States|spinach|"Southern white Democrats, calling themselves ""Redeemers"", took control of the South after the end of Reconstruction, beginning the nadir of American race relations"
United States|spinach|From 1890 to 1910, the Redeemers established so-called Jim Crow laws, disenfranchising most blacks and some poor whites throughout the region
United States|spinach|Blacks would face racial segregation nationwide, especially in the South
United States|spinach|They also occasionally experienced vigilante violence, including lynching.
United States|spinach|In the North, urbanization and an unprecedented influx of immigrants from Southern and Eastern Europe supplied a surplus of labor for the country's industrialization and transformed its culture
United States|spinach|National infrastructure, including telegraph and transcontinental railroads, spurred economic growth and greater settlement and development of the American Old West
United States|spinach|The later invention of electric light and the telephone would also affect communication and urban life.The United States fought Indian Wars west of the Mississippi River from 1810 to at least 1890
United States|spinach|Most of these conflicts ended with the cession of Native American territory and their confinement to Indian reservations
United States|spinach|Additionally, the Trail of Tears in the 1830s exemplified the Indian removal policy that forcibly resettled Indians
United States|spinach|This further expanded acreage under mechanical cultivation, increasing surpluses for international markets
United States|spinach|Mainland expansion also included the purchase of Alaska from Russia in 1867
United States|spinach|In 1893, pro-American elements in Hawaii overthrew the Hawaiian monarchy and formed the Republic of Hawaii, which the U.S
United States|spinach|annexed in 1898
United States|spinach|Puerto Rico, Guam, and the Philippines were ceded by Spain in the same year, following the Spanish–American War
United States|spinach|American Samoa was acquired by the United States in 1900 after the end of the Second Samoan Civil War
United States|spinach|The U.S
United States|spinach|Virgin Islands were purchased from Denmark in 1917.Rapid economic development during the late 19th and early 20th centuries fostered the rise of many prominent industrialists
United States|spinach|Tycoons like Cornelius Vanderbilt, John D
United States|spinach|Rockefeller, and Andrew Carnegie led the nation's progress in the railroad, petroleum, and steel industries
United States|spinach|Banking became a major part of the economy, with J
United States|spinach|P
United States|spinach|Morgan playing a notable role
United States|spinach|The American economy boomed, becoming the world's largest
United States|spinach|These dramatic changes were accompanied by growing inequality and social unrest, which prompted the rise of organized labor along with populist, socialist, and anarchist movements
United States|spinach|This period eventually ended with the advent of the Progressive Era, which saw significant reforms including women's suffrage, alcohol prohibition, regulation of consumer goods, and greater antitrust measures to ensure competition and attention to worker conditions.
United States|spinach|"The United States remained neutral from the outbreak of World War I in 1914 until 1917 when it joined the war as an ""associated power"" alongside the Allies of World War I, helping to turn the tide against the Central Powers"
United States|spinach|In 1919, President Woodrow Wilson took a leading diplomatic role at the Paris Peace Conference and advocated strongly for the U.S
United States|spinach|to join the League of Nations
United States|spinach|However, the Senate refused to approve this and did not ratify the Treaty of Versailles that established the League of Nations.In 1920, the women's rights movement won passage of a constitutional amendment granting women's suffrage
United States|spinach|The 1920s and 1930s saw the rise of radio for mass communication and the invention of early television
United States|spinach|The prosperity of the Roaring Twenties ended with the Wall Street Crash of 1929 and the onset of the Great Depression
United States|spinach|After his election as president in 1932, Franklin D
United States|spinach|Roosevelt responded with the New Deal
United States|spinach|The Great Migration of millions of African Americans out of the American South began before World War I and extended through the 1960s; whereas the Dust Bowl of the mid-1930s impoverished many farming communities and spurred a new wave of western migration.
United States|spinach|At first effectively neutral during World War II, the United States began supplying materiel to the Allies in March 1941 through the Lend-Lease program
United States|spinach|On December 7, 1941, the Empire of Japan launched a surprise attack on Pearl Harbor, prompting the United States to join the Allies against the Axis powers, and in the following year, to intern about 120,000 U.S
United States|spinach|residents (including American citizens) of Japanese descent
United States|spinach|Although Japan attacked the United States first, the U.S
United States|spinach|"nonetheless pursued a ""Europe first"" defense policy"
United States|spinach|The United States thus left its vast Asian colony, the Philippines, isolated and fighting a losing struggle against Japanese invasion and occupation
United States|spinach|"During the war, the United States was one of the ""Four Powers"" who met to plan the postwar world, along with Britain, the Soviet Union, and China"
United States|spinach|Although the nation lost around 400,000 military personnel, it emerged relatively undamaged from the war with even greater economic and military influence.The United States played a leading role in the Bretton Woods and Yalta conferences, which signed agreements on new international financial institutions and Europe's postwar reorganization
United States|spinach|As an Allied victory was won in Europe, a 1945 international conference held in San Francisco produced the United Nations Charter, which became active after the war
United States|spinach|The United States and Japan then fought each other in the largest naval battle in history, the Battle of Leyte Gulf
United States|spinach|The United States developed the first nuclear weapons and used them on Japan in the cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki in August 1945; the Japanese surrendered on September 2, ending World War II.
United States|spinach|After World War II, the United States and the Soviet Union competed for power, influence, and prestige during what became known as the Cold War, driven by an ideological divide between capitalism and communism
United States|spinach|They dominated the military affairs of Europe, with the U.S
United States|spinach|and its NATO allies on one side and the Soviet Union and its Warsaw Pact allies on the other
United States|spinach|The U.S
United States|spinach|developed a policy of containment towards the expansion of communist influence
United States|spinach|While the U.S
United States|spinach|and Soviet Union engaged in proxy wars and developed powerful nuclear arsenals, the two countries avoided direct military conflict.The United States often opposed Third World movements that it viewed as Soviet-sponsored and occasionally pursued direct action for regime change against left-wing governments, occasionally supporting authoritarian right-wing regimes
United States|spinach|American troops fought communist Chinese and North Korean forces in the Korean War of 1950–1953
United States|spinach|"The Soviet Union's 1957 launch of the first artificial satellite and its 1961 launch of the first crewed spaceflight initiated a ""Space Race"" in which the United States became the first nation to land a man on the Moon in 1969"
United States|spinach|The United States became increasingly involved in the Vietnam War (1955–1975), introducing combat forces in 1965.At home, the U.S
United States|spinach|had experienced sustained economic expansion and a rapid growth of its population and middle class following World War II
United States|spinach|After a surge in female labor participation, especially in the 1970s, by 1985, the majority of women aged 16 and over were employed
United States|spinach|Construction of an Interstate Highway System transformed the nation's infrastructure over the following decades
United States|spinach|Millions moved from farms and inner cities to large suburban housing developments
United States|spinach|In 1959, the United States formally expanded beyond the contiguous United States when the territories of Alaska and Hawaii became, respectively, the 49th and 50th states admitted into the Union
United States|spinach|The growing Civil Rights Movement used nonviolence to confront segregation and discrimination, with Martin Luther King Jr
United States|spinach|becoming a prominent leader and figurehead
United States|spinach|A combination of court decisions and legislation, culminating in the Civil Rights Act of 1968, sought to end racial discrimination
United States|spinach|"Meanwhile, a counterculture movement grew, which was fueled by opposition to the Vietnam war, the Black Power movement, and the sexual revolution.The launch of a ""War on Poverty"" expanded entitlements and welfare spending, including the creation of Medicare and Medicaid, two programs that provide health coverage to the elderly and poor, respectively, and the means-tested Food Stamp Program and Aid to Families with Dependent Children.The 1970s and early 1980s saw the onset of stagflation"
United States|spinach|The United States supported Israel during the Yom Kippur War; in response, the country faced an oil embargo from OPEC nations, sparking the 1973 oil crisis
United States|spinach|In 1979, President Jimmy Carter brokered a peace treaty between Egypt and Israel, marking the first time an Arab nation recognized Israeli existence
United States|spinach|After his election, President Ronald Reagan responded to economic stagnation with free-market oriented reforms
United States|spinach|"Following the collapse of détente, he abandoned ""containment"" and initiated the more aggressive ""rollback"" strategy towards the Soviet Union"
United States|spinach|"The late 1980s brought a ""thaw"" in relations with the Soviet Union, and its collapse in 1991 finally ended the Cold War"
United States|spinach|This brought about unipolarity with the U.S
United States|spinach|unchallenged as the world's dominant superpower.
United States|spinach|After the Cold War, the conflict in the Middle East triggered a crisis in 1990, when Iraq invaded and annexed Kuwait, an ally of the United States
United States|spinach|Fearing the spread of instability, in August, President George H
United States|spinach|W
United States|spinach|Bush launched and led the Gulf War against Iraq; waged until February 1991 by coalition forces from 34 nations, it ended in the expulsion of Iraqi forces from Kuwait and restoration of the monarchy.Originating within U.S
United States|spinach|military defense networks, the Internet spread to international academic platforms and then to the public in the 1990s, greatly affecting the global economy, society, and culture
United States|spinach|Due to the dot-com boom, stable monetary policy, and reduced social welfare spending, the 1990s saw the longest economic expansion in modern U.S
United States|spinach|history
United States|spinach|Beginning in 1994, the U.S
United States|spinach|signed the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), causing trade among the U.S., Canada, and Mexico to soar.
United States|spinach|On September 11, 2001, al-Qaeda terrorist hijackers flew passenger planes into the World Trade Center in New York City and the Pentagon near Washington, D.C., killing nearly 3,000 people
United States|spinach|Hundreds more died later from illnesses related to the attacks, and perhaps thousands of first responders, cleanup workers, and survivors suffer from long-term effects
United States|spinach|In response, President George W
United States|spinach|Bush launched the War on Terror, which included a nearly 20-year war in Afghanistan from 2001 to 2021 and the 2003–2011 Iraq War
United States|spinach|A 2011 military operation in Pakistan led to the killing of Osama bin Laden.Government policy designed to promote affordable housing, widespread failures in corporate and regulatory governance, and historically low interest rates set by the Federal Reserve led to the United States housing bubble in 2006, which culminated with the financial crisis of 2007–2008 and the Great Recession, the nation's largest economic contraction since the Great Depression
United States|spinach|During the crisis, assets owned by Americans lost about a quarter of their value
United States|spinach|Barack Obama, the first multiracial president, with African-American ancestry was elected in 2008 amid the crisis, and subsequently passed American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 economic stimulus and the Dodd–Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act in an attempt to mitigate its negative effects and ensure there would not be a repeat of the crisis.
United States|spinach|Republican Donald Trump was elected as the 45th president in 2016, a result viewed as one of the biggest political upsets in American history
United States|spinach|In 2020, Democrat Joe Biden was elected as the 46th president
United States|spinach|On January 6, 2021, supporters of outgoing President Trump stormed the United States Capitol in an unsuccessful effort to disrupt the presidential Electoral College vote count.

United States|spinach|Article One protects the right to the writ of habeas corpus
United States|spinach|The Constitution has been amended 27 times; the first ten amendments, which make up the Bill of Rights, and the Fourteenth Amendment form the central basis of Americans' individual rights
United States|spinach|All laws and governmental procedures are subject to judicial review, and any law can be voided if the courts determine that it violates the Constitution
United States|spinach|The principle of judicial review, not explicitly mentioned in the Constitution, was established by the Supreme Court in Marbury v
United States|spinach|Madison (1803) in a decision handed down by Chief Justice John Marshall.The federal government comprises three branches:
United States|spinach|Legislative
United States|spinach|The bicameral Congress, made up of the Senate and the House of Representatives, makes federal law, declares war, approves treaties, has the power of the purse, and has the power of impeachment, by which it can remove sitting members of the government.

United States|spinach|The states and the District of Columbia choose the president of the United States
United States|spinach|Each state has presidential electors equal to the number of their representatives and senators in Congress; the District of Columbia has three because of the 23rd Amendment
United States|spinach|Territories of the United States such as Puerto Rico do not have presidential electors, and so people in those territories cannot vote for the president.The United States also observes tribal sovereignty of the American Indian nations to a limited degree, as it does with the states' sovereignty
United States|spinach|American Indians are U.S
United States|spinach|citizens and tribal lands are subject to the jurisdiction of the U.S

United States|spinach|"More recent immigration from Asia and especially Latin America has added to a cultural mix that has been described as both a homogenizing melting pot, and a heterogeneous salad bowl in which immigrants and their descendants retain distinctive cultural characteristics.Americans have traditionally been characterized by a strong work ethic, competitiveness, and individualism, as well as a unifying belief in an ""American creed"" emphasizing liberty, equality, private property, democracy, rule of law, and a preference for limited government"
United States|spinach|Americans are extremely charitable by global standards
United States|spinach|according to a 2006 British study, Americans gave 1.67% of GDP to charity, more than any other nation studied.The American Dream, or the perception that Americans enjoy high social mobility, plays a key role in attracting immigrants

Chenopodium album|spinach|It is widely naturalised elsewhere, e.g
Chenopodium album|spinach|Africa, Australasia, North America, and Oceania, and now occurs almost everywhere (except Antarctica) in soils rich in nitrogen, especially on wasteland.
Chenopodium album|spinach|It tends to grow upright at first, reaching heights of 10–150 cm (rarely to 3 m), but typically becomes recumbent after flowering (due to the weight of the foliage and seeds) unless supported by other plants
Chenopodium album|spinach|The leaves are alternate and varied in appearance
Chenopodium album|spinach|The first leaves, near the base of the plant, are toothed and roughly diamond-shaped, 3–7 cm long and 3–6 cm broad
Chenopodium album|spinach|The leaves on the upper part of the flowering stems are entire and lanceolate-rhomboid, 1–5 cm long and 0.4–2 cm broad; they are waxy-coated, unwettable and mealy in appearance, with a whitish coat on the underside
Chenopodium album|spinach|The small flowers are radially symmetrical and grow in small cymes on a dense branched inflorescence 10–40 cm long
Chenopodium album|spinach|Further, the flowers are bisexual and female, with five tepals which are mealy on outer surface, and shortly united at the base
Chenopodium album|spinach|There are five stamens.
Chenopodium album|spinach|Chenopodium album has a very complex taxonomy and has been divided in numerous microspecies, subspecies and varieties, but it is difficult to differentiate between them

Chenopodium album|spinach|It is one of the more robust and competitive weeds, capable of producing crop losses of up to 13% in corn, 25% in soybeans, and 48% in sugar beets at an average plant distribution
Chenopodium album|spinach|It may be controlled by dark tillage, rotary hoeing, or flaming when the plants are small
Chenopodium album|spinach|Crop rotation of small grains will suppress an infestation
Chenopodium album|spinach|It is easily controlled with a number of pre-emergence herbicides
Chenopodium album|spinach|Its pollen may contribute to hay fever-like allergies.
Chenopodium album|spinach|Chenopodium album is vulnerable to leaf miners, making it a useful trap crop as a companion plant
Chenopodium album|spinach|Growing near other plants, it attracts leaf miners which might otherwise have attacked the crop to be protected
Chenopodium album|spinach|It is a host plant for the beet leafhopper, an insect which transmits curly top virus to beet crops.
Chenopodium album|spinach|The leaves and young shoots may be eaten raw or cooked as a leaf vegetable, but should be eaten in moderation due to high levels of oxalic acid
Chenopodium album|spinach|The flower buds and flowers can also be eaten cooked
Chenopodium album|spinach|Each plant produces tens of thousands of black seeds
Chenopodium album|spinach|These are high in protein, vitamin A, calcium, phosphorus, and potassium
Chenopodium album|spinach|Quinoa, a closely related species, is grown specifically for its seeds
Chenopodium album|spinach|The Zuni people cook the young plants' greens.Archaeologists analysing carbonized plant remains found in storage pits and ovens at Iron Age, Viking Age, and Roman sites in Europe have found its seeds mixed with conventional grains and even inside the stomachs of Danish bog bodies.In India, the plant is called bathua and found abundantly in the winter season
Chenopodium album|spinach|The leaves and young shoots of this plant are used in dishes such as soups, curries, and paratha-stuffed breads, common in North India
Chenopodium album|spinach|The seeds or grains are used in phambra or laafi, gruel-type dishes in Himachal Pradesh, and in mildly alcoholic fermented beverages such as soora and ghanti
Chenopodium album|spinach|"In Haryana state, the ""bathue ka raita"" i.e"
Chenopodium album|spinach|the raita (yogurt dip) made with bathua, is very popular in winters
Chenopodium album|spinach|Bathua seeds also double up for rice and dal
Chenopodium album|spinach|Napoleon Bonaparte is said to have once relied on bathua seeds to feed his troops during lean times.
