The modern English word  Earth developed, via Middle English, from an Old English noun most often spelled eorðe|earth
It has cognates in every Germanic language, and their ancestral root has been reconstructed as *erþō|earth
In its earliest attestation, the word eorðe was already being used to translate the many senses of Latin terra and Greek γῆ gē|earth
the ground, its soil, dry land, the human world, the surface of the world (including the sea), and the globe itself|earth
As with Roman Terra/Tellūs and Greek Gaia, Earth may have been a personified goddess in Germanic paganism|earth
late Norse mythology included Jörð ('Earth'), a giantess often given as the mother of Thor.Historically, earth has been written in lowercase|earth
"From early Middle English, its definite sense as ""the globe"" was expressed as the earth"|earth
By Early Modern English, many nouns were capitalized, and the earth was also written the Earth, particularly when referenced along with other heavenly bodies|earth
More recently, the name is sometimes simply given as Earth, by analogy with the names of the other planets, though earth and forms with the remain common|earth
House styles now vary|earth
Oxford spelling recognizes the lowercase form as the most common, with the capitalized form an acceptable variant|earth
"Another convention capitalizes ""Earth"" when appearing as a name (for example, ""Earth's atmosphere"") but writes it in lowercase when preceded by the (for example, ""the atmosphere of the earth"")"|earth
"It almost always appears in lowercase in colloquial expressions such as ""what on earth are you doing?""Occasionally, the name Terra  is used in scientific writing and especially in science fiction to distinguish humanity's inhabited planet from others, while in poetry Tellus  has been used to denote personification of the Earth"|earth
Terra is also the name of the planet in some Romance languages (languages that evolved from Latin) like Italian and Portuguese, while in other Romance languages the word gave rise to names with slightly altered spellings (like the Spanish Tierra and the French Terre)|earth
The Latinate form Gæa or Gaea (English|earth
) of the Greek poetic name Gaia (Γαῖα; Ancient Greek|earth
[ɡâi̯.a] or [ɡâj.ja]) is rare, though the alternative spelling Gaia has become common due to the Gaia hypothesis, in which case its pronunciation is  rather than the more classical English .There are a number of adjectives for the planet Earth|earth
From Earth itself comes earthly|earth
From the Latin Terra comes terran , terrestrial , and (via French) terrene , and from the Latin Tellus comes tellurian  and telluric.|earth
The oldest material found in the Solar System is dated to 4.5682+0.0002−0.0004 Ga (billion years) ago|earth
By 4.54±0.04 Ga the primordial Earth had formed|earth
The bodies in the Solar System formed and evolved with the Sun|earth
In theory, a solar nebula partitions a volume out of a molecular cloud by gravitational collapse, which begins to spin and flatten into a circumstellar disk, and then the planets grow out of that disk with the Sun|earth
A nebula contains gas, ice grains, and dust (including primordial nuclides)|earth
According to nebular theory, planetesimals formed by accretion, with the primordial Earth being estimated as likely taking anywhere from 70 to 100 million years to form.Estimates of the age of the Moon range from 4.5 Ga to significantly younger|earth
A leading hypothesis is that it was formed by accretion from material loosed from Earth after a Mars-sized object with about 10% of Earth's mass, named Theia, collided with Earth|earth
It hit Earth with a glancing blow and some of its mass merged with Earth|earth
Between approximately 4.1 and 3.8 Ga, numerous asteroid impacts during the Late Heavy Bombardment caused significant changes to the greater surface environment of the Moon and, by inference, to that of Earth.|earth
Earth's atmosphere and oceans were formed by volcanic activity and outgassing|earth
Water vapor from these sources condensed into the oceans, augmented by water and ice from asteroids, protoplanets, and comets|earth
Sufficient water to fill the oceans may have been on Earth since it formed|earth
In this model, atmospheric greenhouse gases kept the oceans from freezing when the newly forming Sun had only 70% of its current luminosity|earth
By 3.5 Ga, Earth's magnetic field was established, which helped prevent the atmosphere from being stripped away by the solar wind.As the molten outer layer of Earth cooled it formed the first solid crust, which is thought to have been mafic in composition|earth
The first continental crust, which was more felsic in composition, formed by the partial melting of this mafic crust|earth
The presence of grains of the mineral zircon of Hadean age in Eoarchean sedimentary rocks suggests that at least some felsic crust existed as early as 4.4 Ga, only 140 Ma after Earth's formation|earth
There are two main models of how this initial small volume of continental crust evolved to reach its current abundance|earth
(1) a relatively steady growth up to the present day, which is supported by the radiometric dating of continental crust globally and (2) an initial rapid growth in the volume of continental crust during the Archean, forming the bulk of the continental crust that now exists, which is supported by isotopic evidence from hafnium in zircons and neodymium in sedimentary rocks|earth
The two models and the data that support them can be reconciled by large-scale recycling of the continental crust, particularly during the early stages of Earth's history.New continental crust forms as a result of plate tectonics, a process ultimately driven by the continuous loss of heat from Earth's interior|earth
Over the period of hundreds of millions of years, tectonic forces have caused areas of continental crust to group together to form supercontinents that have subsequently broken apart|earth
At approximately 750 Ma, one of the earliest known supercontinents, Rodinia, began to break apart|earth
The continents later recombined to form Pannotia at 600–540 Ma, then finally Pangaea, which also began to break apart at 180 Ma.The most recent pattern of ice ages began about 40 Ma, and then intensified during the Pleistocene about 3 Ma|earth
High- and middle-latitude regions have since undergone repeated cycles of glaciation and thaw, repeating about every 21,000, 41,000 and 100,000 years|earth
"The Last Glacial Period, colloquially called the ""last ice age"", covered large parts of the continents, up to the middle latitudes, in ice and ended about 11,700 years ago."|earth
Chemical reactions led to the first self-replicating molecules about four billion years ago|earth
A half billion years later, the last common ancestor of all current life arose|earth
The evolution of photosynthesis allowed the Sun's energy to be harvested directly by life forms|earth
The resultant molecular oxygen (O2) accumulated in the atmosphere and due to interaction with ultraviolet solar radiation, formed a protective ozone layer (O3) in the upper atmosphere|earth
The incorporation of smaller cells within larger ones resulted in the development of complex cells called eukaryotes|earth
True multicellular organisms formed as cells within colonies became increasingly specialized|earth
Aided by the absorption of harmful ultraviolet radiation by the ozone layer, life colonized Earth's surface|earth
Among the earliest fossil evidence for life is microbial mat fossils found in 3.48 billion-year-old sandstone in Western Australia, biogenic graphite found in 3.7 billion-year-old metasedimentary rocks in Western Greenland, and remains of biotic material found in 4.1 billion-year-old rocks in Western Australia|earth
The earliest direct evidence of life on Earth is contained in 3.45 billion-year-old Australian rocks showing fossils of microorganisms.During the Neoproterozoic, 1000 to 541 Ma, much of Earth might have been covered in ice|earth
"This hypothesis has been termed ""Snowball Earth"", and it is of particular interest because it preceded the Cambrian explosion, when multicellular life forms significantly increased in complexity"|earth
Following the Cambrian explosion, 535 Ma, there have been at least five major mass extinctions and many minor ones|earth
Apart from the proposed current Holocene extinction event, the most recent was 66 Ma, when an asteroid impact triggered the extinction of the non-avian dinosaurs and other large reptiles, but largely spared small animals such as insects, mammals, lizards and birds|earth
Mammalian life has diversified over the past 66 Mys, and several million years ago an African ape gained the ability to stand upright|earth
This facilitated tool use and encouraged communication that provided the nutrition and stimulation needed for a larger brain, which led to the evolution of humans|earth
The development of agriculture, and then civilization, led to humans having an influence on Earth and the nature and quantity of other life forms that continues to this day.|earth
Because carbon dioxide (CO2) has a long lifespan in the atmosphere, moderate human CO2 emissions may postpone the next glacial inception by 100,000 years.Earth's expected long-term future is tied to that of the Sun|earth
Over the next 1.1 billion years, solar luminosity will increase by 10%, and over the next 3.5 billion years by 40%|earth
Earth's increasing surface temperature will accelerate the inorganic carbon cycle, reducing CO2 concentration to levels lethally low for plants (10 ppm for C4 photosynthesis) in approximately 100–900 million years|earth
The lack of vegetation will result in the loss of oxygen in the atmosphere, making animal life impossible|earth
Due to the increased luminosity, Earth's mean temperature may reach 100 °C (212 °F) in 1.5 billion years, and all ocean water will evaporate and be lost to space, which may trigger a runaway greenhouse effect, within an estimated 1.6 to 3 billion years|earth
Even if the Sun were stable, a fraction of the water in the modern oceans will descend to the mantle, due to reduced steam venting from mid-ocean ridges.The Sun will evolve to become a red giant in about 5 billion years|earth
Models predict that the Sun will expand to roughly 1 AU (150 million km; 93 million mi), about 250 times its present radius|earth
Earth's fate is less clear|earth
As a red giant, the Sun will lose roughly 30% of its mass, so, without tidal effects, Earth will move to an orbit 1.7 AU (250 million km; 160 million mi) from the Sun when the star reaches its maximum radius, otherwise, with tidal effects, it may enter the Sun's atmosphere and be vaporized.|earth
The shape of Earth is nearly spherical|earth
There is a small flattening at the poles and bulging around the equator due to Earth's rotation|earth
Therefore, a better approximation of Earth's shape is an oblate spheroid, whose equatorial diameter is 43 kilometres (27 mi) larger than the pole-to-pole diameter.The average diameter of the reference spheroid is 12,742 kilometres (7,918 mi)|earth
Local topography deviates from this idealized spheroid, although on a global scale these deviations are small compared to Earth's radius|earth
the maximum deviation of only 0.17% is at the Mariana Trench (10,925 metres or 35,843 feet below local sea level), whereas Mount Everest (8,848 metres or 29,029 feet above local sea level) represents a deviation of 0.14%|earth
The point on the surface farthest from Earth's center of mass is the summit of the equatorial Chimborazo volcano in Ecuador (6,384.4 km or 3,967.1 mi).In geodesy, the exact shape that Earth's oceans would adopt in the absence of land and perturbations such as tides and winds is called the geoid|earth
More precisely, the geoid is the surface of gravitational equipotential at mean sea level (MSL).Sea surface topography are water deviations from MSL, analogous to land topography.|earth
Earth's mass is approximately 5.97×1024 kg (5,970 Yg)|earth
It is composed mostly of iron (32.1%), oxygen (30.1%), silicon (15.1%), magnesium (13.9%), sulfur (2.9%), nickel (1.8%), calcium (1.5%), and aluminum (1.4%), with the remaining 1.2% consisting of trace amounts of other elements|earth
Due to mass segregation, the core region is estimated to be primarily composed of iron (88.8%), with smaller amounts of nickel (5.8%), sulfur (4.5%), and less than 1% trace elements.The most common rock constituents of the crust are nearly all oxides|earth
chlorine, sulfur, and fluorine are the important exceptions to this and their total amount in any rock is usually much less than 1%|earth
Over 99% of the crust is composed of 11 oxides, principally silica, alumina, iron oxides, lime, magnesia, potash, and soda.|earth
Earth's interior, like that of the other terrestrial planets, is divided into layers by their chemical or physical (rheological) properties|earth
The outer layer is a chemically distinct silicate solid crust, which is underlain by a highly viscous solid mantle|earth
The crust is separated from the mantle by the Mohorovičić discontinuity|earth
The thickness of the crust varies from about 6 kilometres (3.7 mi) under the oceans to 30–50 km (19–31 mi) for the continents|earth
The crust and the cold, rigid, top of the upper mantle are collectively known as the lithosphere, which is divided into independently moving tectonic plates.Beneath the lithosphere is the asthenosphere, a relatively low-viscosity layer on which the lithosphere rides|earth
Important changes in crystal structure within the mantle occur at 410 and 660 km (250 and 410 mi) below the surface, spanning a transition zone that separates the upper and lower mantle|earth
Beneath the mantle, an extremely low viscosity liquid outer core lies above a solid inner core|earth
Earth's inner core may be rotating at a slightly higher angular velocity than the remainder of the planet, advancing by 0.1–0.5° per year, although both somewhat higher and much lower rates have also been proposed|earth
The radius of the inner core is about one-fifth of that of Earth.|earth
The major heat-producing isotopes within Earth are potassium-40, uranium-238, and thorium-232|earth
At the center, the temperature may be up to 6,000 °C (10,830 °F), and the pressure could reach 360 GPa (52 million psi)|earth
Because much of the heat is provided by radioactive decay, scientists postulate that early in Earth's history, before isotopes with short half-lives were depleted, Earth's heat production was much higher|earth
At approximately 3 Gyr, twice the present-day heat would have been produced, increasing the rates of mantle convection and plate tectonics, and allowing the production of uncommon igneous rocks such as komatiites that are rarely formed today.|earth
The mean heat loss from Earth is 87 mW m−2, for a global heat loss of 4.42×1013 W|earth
A portion of the core's thermal energy is transported toward the crust by mantle plumes, a form of convection consisting of upwellings of higher-temperature rock|earth
These plumes can produce hotspots and flood basalts|earth
More of the heat in Earth is lost through plate tectonics, by mantle upwelling associated with mid-ocean ridges|earth
The final major mode of heat loss is through conduction through the lithosphere, the majority of which occurs under the oceans because the crust there is much thinner than that of the continents.|earth
Earth's mechanically rigid outer layer, the lithosphere, is divided into tectonic plates|earth
These plates are rigid segments that move relative to each other at one of three boundaries types|earth
at convergent boundaries, two plates come together; at divergent boundaries, two plates are pulled apart; and at transform boundaries, two plates slide past one another laterally|earth
Along these plate boundaries, earthquakes, volcanic activity, mountain-building, and oceanic trench formation can occur|earth
The tectonic plates ride on top of the asthenosphere, the solid but less-viscous part of the upper mantle that can flow and move along with the plates.As the tectonic plates migrate, oceanic crust is subducted under the leading edges of the plates at convergent boundaries|earth
At the same time, the upwelling of mantle material at divergent boundaries creates mid-ocean ridges|earth
The combination of these processes recycles the oceanic crust back into the mantle|earth
Due to this recycling, most of the ocean floor is less than 100 Ma old|earth
The oldest oceanic crust is located in the Western Pacific and is estimated to be 200 Ma old|earth
By comparison, the oldest dated continental crust is 4,030 Ma, although zircons have been found preserved as clasts within Eoarchean sedimentary rocks that give ages up to 4,400 Ma, indicating that at least some continental crust existed at that time.The seven major plates are the Pacific, North American, Eurasian, African, Antarctic, Indo-Australian, and South American|earth
Other notable plates include the Arabian Plate, the Caribbean Plate, the Nazca Plate off the west coast of South America and the Scotia Plate in the southern Atlantic Ocean|earth
The Australian Plate fused with the Indian Plate between 50 and 55 Ma|earth
The fastest-moving plates are the oceanic plates, with the Cocos Plate advancing at a rate of 75 mm/a (3.0 in/year) and the Pacific Plate moving 52–69 mm/a (2.0–2.7 in/year)|earth
At the other extreme, the slowest-moving plate is the South American Plate, progressing at a typical rate of 10.6 mm/a (0.42 in/year).|earth
The total surface area of Earth is about 510 million km2 (197 million sq mi)|earth
Of this, 70.8%, or 361.13 million km2 (139.43 million sq mi), is below sea level and covered by ocean water|earth
Below the ocean's surface are much of the continental shelf, mountains, volcanoes, oceanic trenches, submarine canyons, oceanic plateaus, abyssal plains, and a globe-spanning mid-ocean ridge system|earth
The remaining 29.2%, or 148.94 million km2 (57.51 million sq mi), not covered by water has terrain that varies greatly from place to place and consists of mountains, deserts, plains, plateaus, and other landforms|earth
The elevation of the land surface varies from the low point of −418 m (−1,371 ft) at the Dead Sea, to a maximum altitude of 8,848 m (29,029 ft) at the top of Mount Everest|earth
The mean height of land above sea level is about 797 m (2,615 ft).The continental crust consists of lower density material such as the igneous rocks granite and andesite|earth
Less common is basalt, a denser volcanic rock that is the primary constituent of the ocean floors|earth
Sedimentary rock is formed from the accumulation of sediment that becomes buried and compacted together|earth
Nearly 75% of the continental surfaces are covered by sedimentary rocks, although they form about 5% of the crust|earth
The third form of rock material found on Earth is metamorphic rock, which is created from the transformation of pre-existing rock types through high pressures, high temperatures, or both|earth
The most abundant silicate minerals on Earth's surface include quartz, feldspars, amphibole, mica, pyroxene and olivine|earth
Common carbonate minerals include calcite (found in limestone) and dolomite.Erosion and tectonics, volcanic eruptions, flooding, weathering, glaciation, the growth of coral reefs, and meteorite impacts are among the processes that constantly reshape Earth's surface over geological time.The pedosphere is the outermost layer of Earth's continental surface and is composed of soil and subject to soil formation processes|earth
The total arable land is 10.9% of the land surface, with 1.3% being permanent cropland|earth
Close to 40% of Earth's land surface is used for agriculture, or an estimated 16.7 million km2 (6.4 million sq mi) of cropland and 33.5 million km2 (12.9 million sq mi) of pastureland.|earth
The gravity of Earth is the acceleration that is imparted to objects due to the distribution of mass within Earth|earth
Near Earth's surface, gravitational acceleration is approximately 9.8 m/s2 (32 ft/s2)|earth
Local differences in topography, geology, and deeper tectonic structure cause local and broad, regional differences in Earth's gravitational field, known as gravity anomalies.|earth
The main part of Earth's magnetic field is generated in the core, the site of a dynamo process that converts the kinetic energy of thermally and compositionally driven convection into electrical and magnetic field energy|earth
The field extends outwards from the core, through the mantle, and up to Earth's surface, where it is, approximately, a dipole|earth
The poles of the dipole are located close to Earth's geographic poles|earth
At the equator of the magnetic field, the magnetic-field strength at the surface is 3.05×10−5 T, with a magnetic dipole moment of 7.79×1022 Am2 at epoch 2000, decreasing nearly 6% per century|earth
The convection movements in the core are chaotic; the magnetic poles drift and periodically change alignment|earth
This causes secular variation of the main field and field reversals at irregular intervals averaging a few times every million years|earth
The most recent reversal occurred approximately 700,000 years ago.|earth
The extent of Earth's magnetic field in space defines the magnetosphere|earth
Ions and electrons of the solar wind are deflected by the magnetosphere; solar wind pressure compresses the dayside of the magnetosphere, to about 10 Earth radii, and extends the nightside magnetosphere into a long tail|earth
Because the velocity of the solar wind is greater than the speed at which waves propagate through the solar wind, a supersonic bow shock precedes the dayside magnetosphere within the solar wind|earth
Charged particles are contained within the magnetosphere; the plasmasphere is defined by low-energy particles that essentially follow magnetic field lines as Earth rotates|earth
The ring current is defined by medium-energy particles that drift relative to the geomagnetic field, but with paths that are still dominated by the magnetic field, and the Van Allen radiation belts are formed by high-energy particles whose motion is essentially random, but contained in the magnetosphere.During magnetic storms and substorms, charged particles can be deflected from the outer magnetosphere and especially the magnetotail, directed along field lines into Earth's ionosphere, where atmospheric atoms can be excited and ionized, causing the aurora.|earth
Earth's rotation period relative to the Sun—its mean solar day—is 86,400 seconds of mean solar time (86,400.0025 SI seconds)|earth
Because Earth's solar day is now slightly longer than it was during the 19th century due to tidal deceleration, each day varies between 0 and 2 ms longer than the mean solar day.Earth's rotation period relative to the fixed stars, called its stellar day by the International Earth Rotation and Reference Systems Service (IERS), is 86,164.0989 seconds of mean solar time (UT1), or 23h 56m 4.0989s|earth
Earth's rotation period relative to the precessing or moving mean March equinox (when the Sun is at 90° on the equator), is 86,164.0905 seconds of mean solar time (UT1) (23h 56m 4.0905s)|earth
Thus the sidereal day is shorter than the stellar day by about 8.4 ms.Apart from meteors within the atmosphere and low-orbiting satellites, the main apparent motion of celestial bodies in Earth's sky is to the west at a rate of 15°/h = 15'/min|earth
For bodies near the celestial equator, this is equivalent to an apparent diameter of the Sun or the Moon every two minutes; from Earth's surface, the apparent sizes of the Sun and the Moon are approximately the same.|earth
Earth orbits the Sun at an average distance of about 150 million km (93 million mi) every 365.2564 mean solar days, or one sidereal year|earth
This gives an apparent movement of the Sun eastward with respect to the stars at a rate of about 1°/day, which is one apparent Sun or Moon diameter every 12 hours|earth
Due to this motion, on average it takes 24 hours—a solar day—for Earth to complete a full rotation about its axis so that the Sun returns to the meridian|earth
The orbital speed of Earth averages about 29.78 km/s (107,200 km/h; 66,600 mph), which is fast enough to travel a distance equal to Earth's diameter, about 12,742 km (7,918 mi), in seven minutes, and the distance to the Moon, 384,000 km (239,000 mi), in about 3.5 hours.The Moon and Earth orbit a common barycenter every 27.32 days relative to the background stars|earth
When combined with the Earth-Moon system's common orbit around the Sun, the period of the synodic month, from new moon to new moon, is 29.53 days|earth
Viewed from the celestial north pole, the motion of Earth, the Moon, and their axial rotations are all counterclockwise|earth
Viewed from a vantage point above the Sun and Earth's north poles, Earth orbits in a counterclockwise direction about the Sun|earth
The orbital and axial planes are not precisely aligned|earth
Earth's axis is tilted some 23.44 degrees from the perpendicular to the Earth-Sun plane (the ecliptic), and the Earth-Moon plane is tilted up to ±5.1 degrees against the Earth-Sun plane|earth
Without this tilt, there would be an eclipse every two weeks, alternating between lunar eclipses and solar eclipses.The Hill sphere, or the sphere of gravitational influence, of Earth is about 1.5 million km (930,000 mi) in radius|earth
This is the maximum distance at which Earth's gravitational influence is stronger than the more distant Sun and planets|earth
Objects must orbit Earth within this radius, or they can become unbound by the gravitational perturbation of the Sun.Earth, along with the Solar System, is situated in the Milky Way and orbits about 28,000 light-years from its center|earth
It is about 20 light-years above the galactic plane in the Orion Arm.|earth
The axial tilt of Earth is approximately 23.439281° with the axis of its orbit plane, always pointing towards the Celestial Poles|earth
Due to Earth's axial tilt, the amount of sunlight reaching any given point on the surface varies over the course of the year|earth
This causes the seasonal change in climate, with summer in the Northern Hemisphere occurring when the Tropic of Cancer is facing the Sun, and in the Southern Hemisphere when the Tropic of Capricorn faces the Sun|earth
In each instance, winter occurs simultaneously in the opposite hemisphere|earth
During the summer, the day lasts longer, and the Sun climbs higher in the sky|earth
In winter, the climate becomes cooler and the days shorter|earth
Above the Arctic Circle and below the Antarctic Circle there is no daylight at all for part of the year, causing a polar night, and this night extends for several months at the poles themselves|earth
These same latitudes also experience a midnight sun, where the sun remains visible all day.By astronomical convention, the four seasons can be determined by the solstices—the points in the orbit of maximum axial tilt toward or away from the Sun—and the equinoxes, when Earth's rotational axis is aligned with its orbital axis|earth
In the Northern Hemisphere, winter solstice currently occurs around 21 December; summer solstice is near 21 June, spring equinox is around 20 March and autumnal equinox is about 22 or 23 September|earth
In the Southern Hemisphere, the situation is reversed, with the summer and winter solstices exchanged and the spring and autumnal equinox dates swapped.The angle of Earth's axial tilt is relatively stable over long periods of time|earth
Its axial tilt does undergo nutation; a slight, irregular motion with a main period of 18.6 years|earth
The orientation (rather than the angle) of Earth's axis also changes over time, precessing around in a complete circle over each 25,800-year cycle; this precession is the reason for the difference between a sidereal year and a tropical year|earth
Both of these motions are caused by the varying attraction of the Sun and the Moon on Earth's equatorial bulge|earth
The poles also migrate a few meters across Earth's surface|earth
This polar motion has multiple, cyclical components, which collectively are termed quasiperiodic motion|earth
In addition to an annual component to this motion, there is a 14-month cycle called the Chandler wobble|earth
Earth's rotational velocity also varies in a phenomenon known as length-of-day variation.In modern times, Earth's perihelion occurs around 3 January, and its aphelion around 4 July|earth
These dates change over time due to precession and other orbital factors, which follow cyclical patterns known as Milankovitch cycles|earth
The changing Earth-Sun distance causes an increase of about 6.8% in solar energy reaching Earth at perihelion relative to aphelion|earth
Because the Southern Hemisphere is tilted toward the Sun at about the same time that Earth reaches the closest approach to the Sun, the Southern Hemisphere receives slightly more energy from the Sun than does the northern over the course of a year|earth
This effect is much less significant than the total energy change due to the axial tilt, and most of the excess energy is absorbed by the higher proportion of water in the Southern Hemisphere.|earth
The Moon is a relatively large, terrestrial, planet-like natural satellite, with a diameter about one-quarter of Earth's|earth
It is the largest moon in the Solar System relative to the size of its planet, although Charon is larger relative to the dwarf planet Pluto|earth
"The natural satellites of other planets are also referred to as ""moons"", after Earth's"|earth
The most widely accepted theory of the Moon's origin, the giant-impact hypothesis, states that it formed from the collision of a Mars-size protoplanet called Theia with the early Earth|earth
This hypothesis explains (among other things) the Moon's relative lack of iron and volatile elements and the fact that its composition is nearly identical to that of Earth's crust.The gravitational attraction between Earth and the Moon causes tides on Earth|earth
The same effect on the Moon has led to its tidal locking|earth
its rotation period is the same as the time it takes to orbit Earth|earth
As a result, it always presents the same face to the planet|earth
As the Moon orbits Earth, different parts of its face are illuminated by the Sun, leading to the lunar phases|earth
Due to their tidal interaction, the Moon recedes from Earth at the rate of approximately 38 mm/a (1.5 in/year)|earth
Over millions of years, these tiny modifications—and the lengthening of Earth's day by about 23 µs/yr—add up to significant changes|earth
During the Ediacaran period, for example, (approximately 620 Ma) there were 400±7 days in a year, with each day lasting 21.9±0.4 hours.The Moon may have dramatically affected the development of life by moderating the planet's climate|earth
Paleontological evidence and computer simulations show that Earth's axial tilt is stabilized by tidal interactions with the Moon|earth
Some theorists think that without this stabilization against the torques applied by the Sun and planets to Earth's equatorial bulge, the rotational axis might be chaotically unstable, exhibiting large changes over millions of years, as is the case for Mars, though this is disputed.Viewed from Earth, the Moon is just far enough away to have almost the same apparent-sized disk as the Sun|earth
The angular size (or solid angle) of these two bodies match because, although the Sun's diameter is about 400 times as large as the Moon's, it is also 400 times more distant|earth
This allows total and annular solar eclipses to occur on Earth.|earth
Earth's co-orbital asteroids population consists of quasi-satellites, objects with a horseshoe orbit and trojans|earth
There are at least five quasi-satellites, including 469219 Kamoʻoalewa|earth
A trojan asteroid companion, 2010 TK7, is librating around the leading Lagrange triangular point, L4, in Earth's orbit around the Sun|earth
The tiny near-Earth asteroid 2006 RH120 makes close approaches to the Earth–Moon system roughly every twenty years|earth
During these approaches, it can orbit Earth for brief periods of time.As of April 2020, there are 2,666 operational, human-made satellites orbiting Earth|earth
There are also inoperative satellites, including Vanguard 1, the oldest satellite currently in orbit, and over 16,000 pieces of tracked space debris|earth
Earth's largest artificial satellite is the International Space Station.|earth
The abundance of water on Earth's surface is a unique feature that distinguishes it from other planets in the Solar System|earth
Earth's hydrosphere consists chiefly of the oceans, but technically includes all water surfaces in the world, including inland seas, lakes, rivers, and underground waters down to a depth of 2,000 m (6,600 ft)|earth
The mass of the oceans is approximately 1.35×1018 metric tons or about 1/4400 of Earth's total mass|earth
The oceans cover an area of 361.8 million km2 (139.7 million sq mi) with a mean depth of 3,682 m (12,080 ft), resulting in an estimated volume of 1.332 billion km3 (320 million cu mi)|earth
If all of Earth's crustal surface were at the same elevation as a smooth sphere, the depth of the resulting world ocean would be 2.7 to 2.8 km (1.68 to 1.74 mi)|earth
About 97.5% of the water is saline; the remaining 2.5% is fresh water|earth
Most fresh water, about 68.7%, is present as ice in ice caps and glaciers.In Earth's coldest regions, snow survives over the summer and changes into ice|earth
This accumulated snow and ice eventually forms into glaciers, bodies of ice that flow under the influence of their own gravity|earth
Alpine glaciers form in mountainous areas, whereas vast ice sheets form over land in polar regions|earth
The flow of glaciers erodes the surface changing it dramatically, with the formation of U-shaped valleys and other landforms|earth
Sea ice in the Arctic covers an area about as big as the United States, although it is quickly retreating as a consequence of climate change.The average salinity of Earth's oceans is about 35 grams of salt per kilogram of seawater (3.5% salt)|earth
Most of this salt was released from volcanic activity or extracted from cool igneous rocks|earth
The oceans are also a reservoir of dissolved atmospheric gases, which are essential for the survival of many aquatic life forms|earth
Sea water has an important influence on the world's climate, with the oceans acting as a large heat reservoir|earth
Shifts in the oceanic temperature distribution can cause significant weather shifts, such as the El Niño–Southern Oscillation.|earth
The atmospheric pressure at Earth's sea level averages 101.325 kPa (14.696 psi), with a scale height of about 8.5 km (5.3 mi)|earth
A dry atmosphere is composed of 78.084% nitrogen, 20.946% oxygen, 0.934% argon, and trace amounts of carbon dioxide and other gaseous molecules|earth
Water vapor content varies between 0.01% and 4% but averages about 1%|earth
The height of the troposphere varies with latitude, ranging between 8 km (5 mi) at the poles to 17 km (11 mi) at the equator, with some variation resulting from weather and seasonal factors.Earth's biosphere has significantly altered its atmosphere|earth
Oxygenic photosynthesis evolved 2.7 Gya, forming the primarily nitrogen–oxygen atmosphere of today|earth
This change enabled the proliferation of aerobic organisms and, indirectly, the formation of the ozone layer due to the subsequent conversion of atmospheric O2 into O3|earth
The ozone layer blocks ultraviolet solar radiation, permitting life on land|earth
Other atmospheric functions important to life include transporting water vapor, providing useful gases, causing small meteors to burn up before they strike the surface, and moderating temperature|earth
This last phenomenon is known as the greenhouse effect|earth
trace molecules within the atmosphere serve to capture thermal energy emitted from the ground, thereby raising the average temperature|earth
Water vapor, carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide, and ozone are the primary greenhouse gases in the atmosphere|earth
Without this heat-retention effect, the average surface temperature would be −18 °C (0 °F), in contrast to the current +15 °C (59 °F), and life on Earth probably would not exist in its current form.|earth
Earth's atmosphere has no definite boundary, gradually becoming thinner and fading into outer space|earth
Three-quarters of the atmosphere's mass is contained within the first 11 km (6.8 mi) of the surface; this lowest layer is called the troposphere|earth
Energy from the Sun heats this layer, and the surface below, causing expansion of the air|earth
This lower-density air then rises and is replaced by cooler, higher-density air|earth
The result is atmospheric circulation that drives the weather and climate through redistribution of thermal energy.|earth
The primary atmospheric circulation bands consist of the trade winds in the equatorial region below 30° latitude and the westerlies in the mid-latitudes between 30° and 60°|earth
Ocean currents are also important factors in determining climate, particularly the thermohaline circulation that distributes thermal energy from the equatorial oceans to the polar regions.The amount of solar energy reaching the Earth's surface decreases with increasing latitude|earth
At higher latitudes, the sunlight reaches the surface at lower angles, and it must pass through thicker columns of the atmosphere|earth
As a result, the mean annual air temperature at sea level decreases by about 0.4 °C (0.7 °F) per degree of latitude from the equator|earth
Earth's surface can be subdivided into specific latitudinal belts of approximately homogeneous climate|earth
Ranging from the equator to the polar regions, these are the tropical (or equatorial), subtropical, temperate and polar climates.Further factors that affect a location's climates are its proximity to oceans, the oceanic and atmospheric circulation, and topology|earth
Places close to oceans typically have colder summers and warmer winters, due to the fact that oceans can store large amounts of heat|earth
The wind transports the cold or the heat of the ocean to the land|earth
Atmospheric circulation also plays an important role|earth
San Francisco and Washington DC are both coastal cities at about the same latitude|earth
San Francisco's climate is significantly more moderate as the prevailing wind direction is from sea to land|earth
Finally, temperatures decrease with height causing mountainous areas to be colder than low-lying areas.Water vapor generated through surface evaporation is transported by circulatory patterns in the atmosphere|earth
When atmospheric conditions permit an uplift of warm, humid air, this water condenses and falls to the surface as precipitation|earth
Most of the water is then transported to lower elevations by river systems and usually returned to the oceans or deposited into lakes|earth
This water cycle is a vital mechanism for supporting life on land and is a primary factor in the erosion of surface features over geological periods|earth
Precipitation patterns vary widely, ranging from several meters of water per year to less than a millimeter|earth
Atmospheric circulation, topographic features, and temperature differences determine the average precipitation that falls in each region.The commonly used Köppen climate classification system has five broad groups (humid tropics, arid, humid middle latitudes, continental and cold polar), which are further divided into more specific subtypes|earth
The Köppen system rates regions based on observed temperature and precipitation|earth
Surface air temperature can rise to around 55 °C (131 °F) in hot deserts, such as Death Valley, and can fall as low as −89 °C (−128 °F) in Antarctica.|earth
Above the troposphere, the atmosphere is usually divided into the stratosphere, mesosphere, and thermosphere|earth
Each layer has a different lapse rate, defining the rate of change in temperature with height|earth
Beyond these, the exosphere thins out into the magnetosphere, where the geomagnetic fields interact with the solar wind|earth
Within the stratosphere is the ozone layer, a component that partially shields the surface from ultraviolet light and thus is important for life on Earth|earth
The Kármán line, defined as 100 km (62 mi) above Earth's surface, is a working definition for the boundary between the atmosphere and outer space.Thermal energy causes some of the molecules at the outer edge of the atmosphere to increase their velocity to the point where they can escape from Earth's gravity|earth
This causes a slow but steady loss of the atmosphere into space|earth
Because unfixed hydrogen has a low molecular mass, it can achieve escape velocity more readily, and it leaks into outer space at a greater rate than other gases|earth
The leakage of hydrogen into space contributes to the shifting of Earth's atmosphere and surface from an initially reducing state to its current oxidizing one|earth
Photosynthesis provided a source of free oxygen, but the loss of reducing agents such as hydrogen is thought to have been a necessary precondition for the widespread accumulation of oxygen in the atmosphere|earth
Hence the ability of hydrogen to escape from the atmosphere may have influenced the nature of life that developed on Earth|earth
In the current, oxygen-rich atmosphere most hydrogen is converted into water before it has an opportunity to escape|earth
Instead, most of the hydrogen loss comes from the destruction of methane in the upper atmosphere.|earth
A planet's life forms inhabit ecosystems, whose total forms the biosphere|earth
The biosphere is divided into a number of biomes, inhabited by broadly similar plants and animals|earth
On land, biomes are separated primarily by differences in latitude, height above sea level and humidity|earth
Terrestrial biomes lying within the Arctic or Antarctic Circles, at high altitudes or in extremely arid areas are relatively barren of plant and animal life; species diversity reaches a peak in humid lowlands at equatorial latitudes|earth
Estimates of the number of species on Earth today vary; most species have not been described|earth
Over 99% of all species that ever lived on Earth are extinct.A planet that can sustain life is termed habitable, even if life did not originate there|earth
The distance of Earth from the Sun, as well as its orbital eccentricity, rate of rotation, axial tilt, geological history, sustaining atmosphere, and magnetic field all contribute to the current climatic conditions at the surface|earth
Earth provides liquid water—an environment where complex organic molecules can assemble and interact, and sufficient energy to sustain metabolism|earth
Plants can take up nutrients from the atmosphere, soils and water|earth
These nutrients are constantly recycled between different species.Extreme weather, such as tropical cyclones (including hurricanes and typhoons), occurs over most of Earth's surface and has a large impact on life in those areas|earth
From 1980 to 2000, these events caused an average of 11,800 human deaths per year|earth
Many places are subject to earthquakes, landslides, tsunamis, volcanic eruptions, tornadoes, blizzards, floods, droughts, wildfires, and other calamities and disasters|earth
Human impact is felt in many areas due to pollution of the air and water, acid rain, loss of vegetation (overgrazing, deforestation, desertification), loss of wildlife, species extinction, soil degradation, soil depletion and erosion|earth
Human activities release greenhouse gases into the atmosphere which cause global warming|earth
This is driving changes such as the melting of glaciers and ice sheets, a global rise in average sea levels, increased risk of drought and wildfires, and migration of species to colder areas.|earth
Earth's human population passed seven billion in the early 2010s, and is projected to peak at around ten billion in the second half of the 21st century|earth
Most of the growth is expected to take place in sub-Saharan Africa|earth
Human population density varies widely around the world, but a majority live in Asia|earth
By 2050, 68% of the world's population is expected to be living in urban, rather than rural, areas|earth
The Northern Hemisphere contains 68% of the world's land mass|earth
Partly due to the predominance of land mass, 90% of humans live in the Northern Hemisphere.It is estimated that one-eighth of Earth's surface is suitable for humans to live on—three-quarters of Earth's surface is covered by oceans, leaving one-quarter as land|earth
Half of that land area is desert (14%), high mountains (27%), or other unsuitable terrains|earth
States claim the planet's entire land surface, except for parts of Antarctica and a few other unclaimed areas|earth
Earth has never had a planetwide government, but the United Nations is the leading worldwide intergovernmental organization.The first human to orbit Earth was Yuri Gagarin on 12 April 1961|earth
In total, about 550 people have visited outer space and reached orbit as of November 2018, and, of these, twelve have walked on the Moon|earth
Normally, the only humans in space are those on the International Space Station|earth
The station's crew, made up of six people, is usually replaced every six months|earth
The farthest that humans have traveled from Earth is 400,171 km (248,655 mi), achieved during the Apollo 13 mission in 1970.|earth
Earth has resources that have been exploited by humans|earth
Those termed non-renewable resources, such as fossil fuels, are only replenished over geological timescales|earth
Large deposits of fossil fuels are obtained from Earth's crust, consisting of coal, petroleum, and natural gas|earth
These deposits are used by humans both for energy production and as feedstock for chemical production|earth
Mineral ore bodies have also been formed within the crust through a process of ore genesis, resulting from actions of magmatism, erosion, and plate tectonics|earth
These metals and other elements are extracted by mining, a process which often brings environmental and health damage.Earth's biosphere produces many useful biological products for humans, including food, wood, pharmaceuticals, oxygen, and the recycling of organic waste|earth
The land-based ecosystem depends upon topsoil and fresh water, and the oceanic ecosystem depends on dissolved nutrients washed down from the land|earth
In 2019, 39 million km2 (15 million sq mi) of Earth's land surface consisted of forest and woodlands, 12 million km2 (4.6 million sq mi) was shrub and grassland, 40 million km2 (15 million sq mi) were used for animal feed production and grazing, and 11 million km2 (4.2 million sq mi) were cultivated as croplands|earth
Of the 12–14% of ice-free land that is used for croplands, 2 percentage points were irrigated in 2015|earth
Humans use building materials to construct shelters.|earth
Human activities, such as the burning of fossil fuels, emit greenhouse gases into the atmosphere of the Earth, altering its climate|earth
It is estimated that global temperatures in the year 2020 were 1.2 °C (2.2 °F) warmer than the preindustrial baseline|earth
This increase in temperature, known as global warming, has contributed to the melting of glaciers, rising sea levels, increased risk of drought and wildfires, and migration of species to colder areas.|earth
Human cultures have developed many views of the planet|earth
The standard astronomical symbol of Earth consists of a cross circumscribed by a circle, , representing the four corners of the world|earth
(See also Earth symbol.) Earth is sometimes personified as a deity|earth
In many cultures it is a mother goddess that is also the primary fertility deity|earth
Creation myths in many religions involve the creation of Earth by a supernatural deity or deities|earth
The Gaia hypothesis, developed in the mid-20th century, compared Earth's environments and life as a single self-regulating organism leading to broad stabilization of the conditions of habitability|earth
Images of Earth taken from space, particularly during the Apollo program, have been credited with altering the way that people viewed the planet that they lived on, emphasizing its beauty, uniqueness and apparent fragility.Scientific investigation has resulted in several culturally transformative shifts in people's view of the planet|earth
Initial belief in a flat Earth was gradually displaced in Ancient Greece by the idea of a spherical Earth, which was attributed to both the philosophers Pythagoras and Parmenides|earth
Earth was generally believed to be the center of the universe until the 16th century, when scientists first concluded that it was a moving object, comparable to the other planets in the Solar System.It was only during the 19th century that geologists realized Earth's age was at least many millions of years|earth
Lord Kelvin used thermodynamics to estimate the age of Earth to be between 20 million and 400 million years in 1864, sparking a vigorous debate on the subject; it was only when radioactivity and radioactive dating were discovered in the late 19th and early 20th centuries that a reliable mechanism for determining Earth's age was established, proving the planet to be billions of years old.|earth
Water (chemical formula H2O) is an inorganic, transparent, tasteless, odorless, and nearly colorless chemical substance, which is the main constituent of Earth's hydrosphere and the fluids of all known living organisms (in which it acts as a solvent)|water
It is vital for all known forms of life, even though it provides no calories or organic nutrients|water
Its chemical formula, H2O, indicates that each of its molecules contains one oxygen and two hydrogen atoms, connected by covalent bonds|water
The hydrogen atoms are attached to the oxygen atom at an angle of 104.45°|water
"""Water"" is the name of the liquid state of H2O at standard conditions for temperature and pressure"|water
A number of natural states of water exist|water
It forms precipitation in the form of rain and aerosols in the form of fog|water
Clouds consist of suspended droplets of water and ice, its solid state|water
When finely divided, crystalline ice may precipitate in the form of snow|water
The gaseous state of water is steam or water vapor.|water
Water covers approximately 70.9% of the Earth's surface, mostly in seas and oceans|water
Small portions of water occur as groundwater (1.7%), in the glaciers and the ice caps of Antarctica and Greenland (1.7%), and in the air as vapor, clouds (consisting of ice and liquid water suspended in air), and precipitation (0.001%)|water
Water moves continually through the water cycle of evaporation, transpiration (evapotranspiration), condensation, precipitation, and runoff, usually reaching the sea.|water
Water plays an important role in the world economy|water
Approximately 70% of the freshwater used by humans goes to agriculture|water
Fishing in salt and fresh water bodies is a major source of food for many parts of the world|water
Much of the long-distance trade of commodities (such as oil, natural gas, and manufactured products) is transported by boats through seas, rivers, lakes, and canals|water
Large quantities of water, ice, and steam are used for cooling and heating, in industry and homes|water
Water is an excellent solvent for a wide variety of substances both mineral and organic; as such it is widely used in industrial processes, and in cooking and washing|water
Water, ice and snow are also central to many sports and other forms of entertainment, such as swimming, pleasure boating, boat racing, surfing, sport fishing, diving, ice skating and skiing.|water
"The word water comes from Old English wæter, from Proto-Germanic *watar (source also of Old Saxon watar, Old Frisian wetir, Dutch water, Old High German wazzar, German Wasser, vatn, Gothic 𐍅𐌰𐍄𐍉 (wato), from Proto-Indo-European *wod-or, suffixed form of root *wed- (""water""; ""wet"")"|water
Also cognate, through the Indo-European root, with Greek ύδωρ (ýdor), Russian вода́ (vodá), Irish uisce, and Albanian ujë.|water
Water (H2O) is a polar inorganic compound that is at room temperature a tasteless and odorless liquid, nearly colorless with a hint of blue|water
"This simplest hydrogen chalcogenide is by far the most studied chemical compound and is described as the ""universal solvent"" for its ability to dissolve many substances"|water
"This allows it to be the ""solvent of life"""|water
indeed, water as found in nature almost always includes various dissolved substances, and special steps are required to obtain chemically pure water|water
Water is the only common substance to exist as a solid, liquid, and gas in normal terrestrial conditions.|water
Along with oxidane, water is one of the two official names for the chemical compound H2O; it is also the liquid phase of H2O|water
The other two common states of matter of water are the solid phase, ice, and the gaseous phase, water vapor or steam|water
The addition or removal of heat can cause phase transitions|water
freezing (water to ice), melting (ice to water), vaporization (water to vapor), condensation (vapor to water), sublimation (ice to vapor) and deposition (vapor to ice).|water
Water differs from most liquids in that it becomes less dense as it freezes|water
In 1 atm pressure, it reaches its maximum density of 1,000 kg/m3 (62.43 lb/cu ft) at 3.98 °C (39.16 °F)|water
The density of ice is 917 kg/m3 (57.25 lb/cu ft), an expansion of 9%|water
This expansion can exert enormous pressure, bursting pipes and cracking rocks (see Frost weathering).In a lake or ocean, water at 4 °C (39.2 °F) sinks to the bottom, and ice forms on the surface, floating on the liquid water|water
This ice insulates the water below, preventing it from freezing solid|water
Without this protection, most aquatic organisms would perish during the winter.|water
At a pressure of one atmosphere (atm), ice melts or water freezes at 0 °C (32 °F) and water boils or vapor condenses at 100 °C (212 °F)|water
However, even below the boiling point, water can change to vapor at its surface by evaporation (vaporization throughout the liquid is known as boiling)|water
Sublimation and deposition also occur on surfaces|water
For example, frost is deposited on cold surfaces while snowflakes form by deposition on an aerosol particle or ice nucleus|water
In the process of freeze-drying, a food is frozen and then stored at low pressure so the ice on its surface sublimates.The melting and boiling points depend on pressure|water
A good approximation for the rate of change of the melting temperature with pressure is given by the Clausius–Clapeyron relation:|water
   is the molar latent heat of melting|water
In most substances, the volume increases when melting occurs, so the melting temperature increases with pressure|water
However, because ice is less dense than water, the melting temperature decreases|water
In glaciers, pressure melting can occur under sufficiently thick volumes of ice, resulting in subglacial lakes.The Clausius-Clapeyron relation also applies to the boiling point, but with the liquid/gas transition the vapor phase has a much lower density than the liquid phase, so the boiling point increases with pressure|water
Water can remain in a liquid state at high temperatures in the deep ocean or underground|water
For example, temperatures exceed 205 °C (401 °F) in Old Faithful, a geyser in Yellowstone National Park|water
In hydrothermal vents, the temperature can exceed 400 °C (752 °F).At sea level, the boiling point of water is 100 °C (212 °F)|water
As atmospheric pressure decreases with altitude, the boiling point decreases by 1 °C every 274 meters|water
High-altitude cooking takes longer than sea-level cooking|water
For example, at 1,524 metres (5,000 ft), cooking time must be increased by a fourth to achieve the desired result|water
(Conversely, a pressure cooker can be used to decrease cooking times by raising the boiling temperature.)|water
On a pressure/temperature phase diagram (see figure), there are curves separating solid from vapor, vapor from liquid, and liquid from solid|water
These meet at a single point called the triple point, where all three phases can coexist|water
The triple point is at a temperature of 273.16 K (0.01 °C) and a pressure of 611.657 pascals (0.00604 atm); it is the lowest pressure at which liquid water can exist|water
Until 2019, the triple point was used to define the Kelvin temperature scale.The water/vapor phase curve terminates at 647.096 K (373.946 °C; 705.103 °F) and 22.064 megapascals (3,200.1 psi; 217.75 atm)|water
This is known as the critical point|water
At higher temperatures and pressures the liquid and vapor phases form a continuous phase called a supercritical fluid|water
It can be gradually compressed or expanded between gas-like and liquid-like densities, its properties (which are quite different from those of ambient water) are sensitive to density|water
For example, for suitable pressures and temperatures it can mix freely with nonpolar compounds, including most organic compounds|water
This makes it useful in a variety of applications including high-temperature electrochemistry and as an ecologically benign solvent or catalyst in chemical reactions involving organic compounds|water
In Earth's mantle, it acts as a solvent during mineral formation, dissolution and deposition.|water
The normal form of ice on the surface of Earth is Ice Ih, a phase that forms crystals with hexagonal symmetry|water
Another with cubic crystalline symmetry, Ice Ic, can occur in the upper atmosphere|water
As the pressure increases, ice forms other crystal structures|water
As of 2019, 17 have been experimentally confirmed and several more are predicted theoretically|water
The 18th form of ice, ice XVIII, a face-centred-cubic, superionic ice phase, was discovered when a droplet of water was subject to a shock wave that raised the water’s pressure to millions of atmospheres and its temperature to thousands of degrees, resulting in a structure of rigid oxygen atoms in which hydrogen atoms flowed freely|water
When sandwiched between layers of graphene, ice forms a square lattice.The details of the chemical nature of liquid water are not well understood; some theories suggest that its unusual behaviour is due to the existence of 2 liquid states.|water
Pure water is usually described as tasteless and odorless, although humans have specific sensors that can feel the presence of water in their mouths, and frogs are known to be able to smell it|water
However, water from ordinary sources (including bottled mineral water) usually has many dissolved substances, that may give it varying tastes and odors|water
Humans and other animals have developed senses that enable them to evaluate the potability of water by avoiding water that is too salty or putrid.|water
Pure water is visibly blue due to absorption of light in the region ca|water
600 nm – 800 nm|water
The color can be easily observed in a glass of tap-water placed against a pure white background, in daylight|water
The principal absorption bands responsible for the color are overtones of the O–H stretching vibrations|water
The apparent intensity of the color increases with the depth of the water column, following Beer's law|water
This also applies, for example, with a swimming pool when the light source is sunlight reflected from the pool's white tiles.|water
In industry, near-infrared spectroscopy is used with aqueous solutions as the greater intensity of the lower overtones of water means that glass cuvettes with short path-length may be employed|water
To observe the fundamental stretching absorption spectrum of water or of an aqueous solution in the region around 3500 cm−1 (2.85 μm) a path length of about 25 μm is needed|water
Also, the cuvette must be both transparent around 3500 cm−1 and insoluble in water; calcium fluoride is one material that is in common use for the cuvette windows with aqueous solutions.|water
The refractive index of liquid water (1.333 at 20 °C (68 °F)) is much higher than that of air (1.0), similar to those of alkanes and ethanol, but lower than those of glycerol (1.473), benzene (1.501), carbon disulfide (1.627), and common types of glass (1.4 to 1.6)|water
The refraction index of ice (1.31) is lower than that of liquid water.|water
In a water molecule, the hydrogen atoms form a 104.5° angle with the oxygen atom|water
The hydrogen atoms are close to two corners of a tetrahedron centered on the oxygen|water
At the other two corners are lone pairs of valence electrons that do not participate in the bonding|water
In a perfect tetrahedron, the atoms would form a 109.5° angle, but the repulsion between the lone pairs is greater than the repulsion between the hydrogen atoms|water
The O–H bond length is about 0.096 nm.Other substances have a tetrahedral molecular structure, for example, methane (CH4) and hydrogen sulfide (H2S)|water
However, oxygen is more electronegative (holds on to its electrons more tightly) than most other elements, so the oxygen atom retains a negative charge while the hydrogen atoms are positively charged|water
Along with the bent structure, this gives the molecule an electrical dipole moment and it is classified as a polar molecule.Water is a good polar solvent, that dissolves many salts and hydrophilic organic molecules such as sugars and simple alcohols such as ethanol|water
Water also dissolves many gases, such as oxygen and carbon dioxide—the latter giving the fizz of carbonated beverages, sparkling wines and beers|water
In addition, many substances in living organisms, such as proteins, DNA and polysaccharides, are dissolved in water|water
The interactions between water and the subunits of these biomacromolecules shape protein folding, DNA base pairing, and other phenomena crucial to life (hydrophobic effect).|water
Many organic substances (such as fats and oils and alkanes) are hydrophobic, that is, insoluble in water|water
Many inorganic substances are insoluble too, including most metal oxides, sulfides, and silicates.|water
Because of its polarity, a molecule of water in the liquid or solid state can form up to four hydrogen bonds with neighboring molecules|water
Hydrogen bonds are about ten times as strong as the Van der Waals force that attracts molecules to each other in most liquids|water
This is the reason why the melting and boiling points of water are much higher than those of other analogous compounds like hydrogen sulfide|water
They also explain its exceptionally high specific heat capacity (about 4.2 J/g/K), heat of fusion (about 333 J/g), heat of vaporization (2257 J/g), and thermal conductivity (between 0.561 and 0.679 W/m/K)|water
These properties make water more effective at moderating Earth's climate, by storing heat and transporting it between the oceans and the atmosphere|water
The hydrogen bonds of water are around 23 kJ/mol (compared to a covalent O-H bond at 492 kJ/mol)|water
Of this, it is estimated that 90% is attributable to electrostatics, while the remaining 10% is partially covalent.These bonds are the cause of water's high surface tension and capillary forces|water
The capillary action refers to the tendency of water to move up a narrow tube against the force of gravity|water
This property is relied upon by all vascular plants, such as trees.|water
Liquid water can be split into the elements hydrogen and oxygen by passing an electric current through it—a process called electrolysis|water
The decomposition requires more energy input than the heat released by the inverse process (285.8 kJ/mol, or 15.9 MJ/kg).|water
Liquid water can be assumed to be incompressible for most purposes|water
its compressibility ranges from 4.4 to 5.1×10−10 Pa−1 in ordinary conditions|water
Even in oceans at 4 km depth, where the pressure is 400 atm, water suffers only a 1.8% decrease in volume.The viscosity of water is about 10−3 Pa·s or 0.01 poise at 20 °C (68 °F), and the speed of sound in liquid water ranges between 1,400 and 1,540 meters per second (4,600 and 5,100 ft/s) depending on temperature|water
Sound travels long distances in water with little attenuation, especially at low frequencies (roughly 0.03 dB/km for 1 kHz), a property that is exploited by cetaceans and humans for communication and environment sensing (sonar).|water
Metallic elements which are more electropositive than hydrogen, particularly the alkali metals and alkaline earth metals such as lithium, sodium, calcium, potassium and cesium displace hydrogen from water, forming hydroxides and releasing hydrogen|water
At high temperatures, carbon reacts with steam to form carbon monoxide and hydrogen.|water
Hydrology is the study of the movement, distribution, and quality of water throughout the Earth|water
The study of the distribution of water is hydrography|water
The study of the distribution and movement of groundwater is hydrogeology, of glaciers is glaciology, of inland waters is limnology and distribution of oceans is oceanography|water
Ecological processes with hydrology are in the focus of ecohydrology.|water
The collective mass of water found on, under, and over the surface of a planet is called the hydrosphere|water
Earth's approximate water volume (the total water supply of the world) is 1.386 × 109 cubic kilometers (3.33 × 108 cubic miles).Liquid water is found in bodies of water, such as an ocean, sea, lake, river, stream, canal, pond, or puddle|water
The majority of water on Earth is sea water|water
Water is also present in the atmosphere in solid, liquid, and vapor states|water
It also exists as groundwater in aquifers.|water
Water is important in many geological processes|water
Groundwater is present in most rocks, and the pressure of this groundwater affects patterns of faulting|water
Water in the mantle is responsible for the melt that produces volcanoes at subduction zones|water
On the surface of the Earth, water is important in both chemical and physical weathering processes|water
Water, and to a lesser but still significant extent, ice, are also responsible for a large amount of sediment transport that occurs on the surface of the earth|water
Deposition of transported sediment forms many types of sedimentary rocks, which make up the geologic record of Earth history.|water
runoff from the land usually reaching the sea.Most water vapors found mostly in the ocean returns to it, but winds carry water vapor over land at the same rate as runoff into the sea, about 47 Tt per year whilst evaporation and transpiration happening in land masses also contribute another 72 Tt per year|water
Precipitation, at a rate of 119 Tt per year over land, has several forms|water
most commonly rain, snow, and hail, with some contribution from fog and dew|water
Dew is small drops of water that are condensed when a high density of water vapor meets a cool surface|water
Dew usually forms in the morning when the temperature is the lowest, just before sunrise and when the temperature of the earth's surface starts to increase|water
Condensed water in the air may also refract sunlight to produce rainbows.|water
Water runoff often collects over watersheds flowing into rivers|water
A mathematical model used to simulate river or stream flow and calculate water quality parameters is a hydrological transport model|water
Some water is diverted to irrigation for agriculture|water
Rivers and seas offer opportunities for travel and commerce|water
Through erosion, runoff shapes the environment creating river valleys and deltas which provide rich soil and level ground for the establishment of population centers|water
A flood occurs when an area of land, usually low-lying, is covered with water which occurs when a river overflows its banks or a storm surge happens|water
On the other hand, drought is an extended period of months or years when a region notes a deficiency in its water supply|water
This occurs when a region receives consistently below average precipitation either due to its topography or due to its location in terms of latitude.|water
"Water occurs as both ""stocks"" and ""flows"""|water
Water can be stored as lakes, water vapor, groundwater or aquifers, and ice and snow|water
Of the total volume of global freshwater, an estimated 69 percent is stored in glaciers and permanent snow cover; 30 percent is in groundwater; and the remaining 1 percent in lakes, rivers, the atmosphere, and biota|water
The length of time water remains in storage is highly variable|water
some aquifers consist of water stored over thousands of years but lake volumes may fluctuate on a seasonal basis, decreasing during dry periods and increasing during wet ones|water
A substantial fraction of the water supply for some regions consists of water extracted from water stored in stocks, and when withdrawals exceed recharge, stocks decrease|water
By some estimates, as much as 30 percent of total water used for irrigation comes from unsustainable withdrawals of groundwater, causing groundwater depletion.|water
Sea water contains about 3.5% sodium chloride on average, plus smaller amounts of other substances|water
The physical properties of seawater differ from fresh water in some important respects|water
It freezes at a lower temperature (about −1.9 °C (28.6 °F)) and its density increases with decreasing temperature to the freezing point, instead of reaching maximum density at a temperature above freezing|water
The salinity of water in major seas varies from about 0.7% in the Baltic Sea to 4.0% in the Red Sea|water
(The Dead Sea, known for its ultra-high salinity levels of between 30–40%, is really a salt lake.)|water
Tides are the cyclic rising and falling of local sea levels caused by the tidal forces of the Moon and the Sun acting on the oceans|water
Tides cause changes in the depth of the marine and estuarine water bodies and produce oscillating currents known as tidal streams|water
The changing tide produced at a given location is the result of the changing positions of the Moon and Sun relative to the Earth coupled with the effects of Earth rotation and the local bathymetry|water
The strip of seashore that is submerged at high tide and exposed at low tide, the intertidal zone, is an important ecological product of ocean tides.|water
From a biological standpoint, water has many distinct properties that are critical for the proliferation of life|water
It carries out this role by allowing organic compounds to react in ways that ultimately allow replication|water
All known forms of life depend on water|water
Water is vital both as a solvent in which many of the body's solutes dissolve and as an essential part of many metabolic processes within the body|water
Metabolism is the sum total of anabolism and catabolism|water
In anabolism, water is removed from molecules (through energy requiring enzymatic chemical reactions) in order to grow larger molecules (e.g., starches, triglycerides, and proteins for storage of fuels and information)|water
In catabolism, water is used to break bonds in order to generate smaller molecules (e.g., glucose, fatty acids, and amino acids to be used for fuels for energy use or other purposes)|water
Without water, these particular metabolic processes could not exist.|water
Water is fundamental to photosynthesis and respiration|water
Photosynthetic cells use the sun's energy to split off water's hydrogen from oxygen|water
Hydrogen is combined with CO2 (absorbed from air or water) to form glucose and release oxygen|water
All living cells use such fuels and oxidize the hydrogen and carbon to capture the sun's energy and reform water and CO2 in the process (cellular respiration).|water
Water is also central to acid-base neutrality and enzyme function|water
An acid, a hydrogen ion (H+, that is, a proton) donor, can be neutralized by a base, a proton acceptor such as a hydroxide ion (OH−) to form water|water
Water is considered to be neutral, with a pH (the negative log of the hydrogen ion concentration) of 7|water
Acids have pH values less than 7 while bases have values greater than 7.|water
Earth surface waters are filled with life|water
The earliest life forms appeared in water; nearly all fish live exclusively in water, and there are many types of marine mammals, such as dolphins and whales|water
Some kinds of animals, such as amphibians, spend portions of their lives in water and portions on land|water
Plants such as kelp and algae grow in the water and are the basis for some underwater ecosystems|water
Plankton is generally the foundation of the ocean food chain.|water
Aquatic vertebrates must obtain oxygen to survive, and they do so in various ways|water
Fish have gills instead of lungs, although some species of fish, such as the lungfish, have both|water
Marine mammals, such as dolphins, whales, otters, and seals need to surface periodically to breathe air|water
Some amphibians are able to absorb oxygen through their skin|water
Invertebrates exhibit a wide range of modifications to survive in poorly oxygenated waters including breathing tubes (see insect and mollusc siphons) and gills (Carcinus)|water
However, as invertebrate life evolved in an aquatic habitat most have little or no specialization for respiration in water.|water
Civilization has historically flourished around rivers and major waterways; Mesopotamia, the so-called cradle of civilization, was situated between the major rivers Tigris and Euphrates; the ancient society of the Egyptians depended entirely upon the Nile|water
The early Indus Valley Civilization (c|water
3300 BCE to 1300 BCE) developed along the Indus River and tributaries that flowed out of the Himalayas|water
Rome was also founded on the banks of the Italian river Tiber|water
Large metropolises like Rotterdam, London, Montreal, Paris, New York City, Buenos Aires, Shanghai, Tokyo, Chicago, and Hong Kong owe their success in part to their easy accessibility via water and the resultant expansion of trade|water
Islands with safe water ports, like Singapore, have flourished for the same reason|water
In places such as North Africa and the Middle East, where water is more scarce, access to clean drinking water was and is a major factor in human development.|water
Water fit for human consumption is called drinking water or potable water|water
Water that is not potable may be made potable by filtration or distillation, or by a range of other methods|water
"More than 660 million people do not have access to safe drinking water.Water that is not fit for drinking but is not harmful to humans when used for swimming or bathing is called by various names other than potable or drinking water, and is sometimes called safe water, or ""safe for bathing"""|water
Chlorine is a skin and mucous membrane irritant that is used to make water safe for bathing or drinking|water
Its use is highly technical and is usually monitored by government regulations (typically 1 part per million (ppm) for drinking water, and 1–2 ppm of chlorine not yet reacted with impurities for bathing water)|water
Water for bathing may be maintained in satisfactory microbiological condition using chemical disinfectants such as chlorine or ozone or by the use of ultraviolet light.|water
Water reclamation is the process of converting wastewater (most commonly sewage, also called municipal wastewater) into water that can be reused for other purposes|water
Freshwater is a renewable resource, recirculated by the natural hydrologic cycle, but pressures over access to it result from the naturally uneven distribution in space and time, growing economic demands by agriculture and industry, and rising populations|water
Currently, nearly a billion people around the world lack access to safe, affordable water|water
In 2000, the United Nations established the Millennium Development Goals for water to halve by 2015 the proportion of people worldwide without access to safe water and sanitation|water
Progress toward that goal was uneven, and in 2015 the UN committed to the Sustainable Development Goals of achieving universal access to safe and affordable water and sanitation by 2030|water
Poor water quality and bad sanitation are deadly; some five million deaths a year are caused by water-related diseases|water
The World Health Organization estimates that safe water could prevent 1.4 million child deaths from diarrhoea each year.In developing countries, 90% of all municipal wastewater still goes untreated into local rivers and streams|water
Some 50 countries, with roughly a third of the world's population, also suffer from medium or high water scarcity and 17 of these extract more water annually than is recharged through their natural water cycles|water
The strain not only affects surface freshwater bodies like rivers and lakes, but it also degrades groundwater resources.|water
The most substantial human use of water is for agriculture, including irrigated agriculture, which accounts for as much as 80 to 90 percent of total human water consumption|water
"In the United States, 42% of freshwater withdrawn for use is for irrigation, but the vast majority of water ""consumed"" (used and not returned to the environment) goes to agriculture.Access to fresh water is often taken for granted, especially in developed countries that have build sophisticated water systems for collecting, purifying, and delivering water, and removing wastewater"|water
But growing economic, demographic, and climatic pressures are increasing concerns about water issues, leading to increasing competition for fixed water resources, giving rise to the concept of peak water|water
As populations and economies continue to grow, consumption of water-thirsty meat expands, and new demands rise for biofuels or new water-intensive industries, new water challenges are likely.An assessment of water management in agriculture was conducted in 2007 by the International Water Management Institute in Sri Lanka to see if the world had sufficient water to provide food for its growing population|water
It assessed the current availability of water for agriculture on a global scale and mapped out locations suffering from water scarcity|water
It found that a fifth of the world's people, more than 1.2 billion, live in areas of physical water scarcity, where there is not enough water to meet all demands|water
A further 1.6 billion people live in areas experiencing economic water scarcity, where the lack of investment in water or insufficient human capacity make it impossible for authorities to satisfy the demand for water|water
The report found that it would be possible to produce the food required in the future, but that continuation of today's food production and environmental trends would lead to crises in many parts of the world|water
To avoid a global water crisis, farmers will have to strive to increase productivity to meet growing demands for food, while industries and cities find ways to use water more efficiently.Water scarcity is also caused by production of water intensive products|water
For example, cotton|water
1 kg of cotton—equivalent of a pair of jeans—requires 10.9 cubic meters (380 cu ft) water to produce|water
While cotton accounts for 2.4% of world water use, the water is consumed in regions that are already at a risk of water shortage|water
Significant environmental damage has been caused|water
for example, the diversion of water by the former Soviet Union from the Amu Darya and Syr Darya rivers to produce cotton was largely responsible for the disappearance of the Aral Sea.|water
"On 7 April 1795, the gram was defined in France to be equal to ""the absolute weight of a volume of pure water equal to a cube of one-hundredth of a meter, and at the temperature of melting ice"""|water
For practical purposes though, a metallic reference standard was required, one thousand times more massive, the kilogram|water
Work was therefore commissioned to determine precisely the mass of one liter of water|water
In spite of the fact that the decreed definition of the gram specified water at 0 °C (32 °F)—a highly reproducible temperature—the scientists chose to redefine the standard and to perform their measurements at the temperature of highest water density, which was measured at the time as 4 °C (39 °F).The Kelvin temperature scale of the SI system was based on the triple point of water, defined as exactly 273.16 K (0.01 °C; 32.02 °F), but as of May 2019 is based on the Boltzmann constant instead|water
The scale is an absolute temperature scale with the same increment as the Celsius temperature scale, which was originally defined according to the boiling point (set to 100 °C (212 °F)) and melting point (set to 0 °C (32 °F)) of water.|water
Natural water consists mainly of the isotopes hydrogen-1 and oxygen-16, but there is also a small quantity of heavier isotopes oxygen-18, oxygen-17, and hydrogen-2 (deuterium)|water
The percentage of the heavier isotopes is very small, but it still affects the properties of water|water
Water from rivers and lakes tends to contain less heavy isotopes than seawater|water
Therefore, standard water is defined in the Vienna Standard Mean Ocean Water specification.|water
The human body contains from 55% to 78% water, depending on body size|water
To function properly, the body requires between one and seven liters (0.22 and 1.54 imp gal; 0.26 and 1.85 U.S|water
gal) of water per day to avoid dehydration; the precise amount depends on the level of activity, temperature, humidity, and other factors|water
Most of this is ingested through foods or beverages other than drinking straight water|water
It is not clear how much water intake is needed by healthy people, though the British Dietetic Association advises that 2.5 liters of total water daily is the minimum to maintain proper hydration, including 1.8 liters (6 to 7 glasses) obtained directly from beverages|water
Medical literature favors a lower consumption, typically 1 liter of water for an average male, excluding extra requirements due to fluid loss from exercise or warm weather.Healthy kidneys can excrete 0.8 to 1 liter of water per hour, but stress such as exercise can reduce this amount|water
People can drink far more water than necessary while exercising, putting them at risk of water intoxication (hyperhydration), which can be fatal|water
"The popular claim that ""a person should consume eight glasses of water per day"" seems to have no real basis in science"|water
Studies have shown that extra water intake, especially up to 500 milliliters (18 imp fl oz; 17 U.S|water
fl oz) at mealtime was associated with weight loss|water
Adequate fluid intake is helpful in preventing constipation.|water
An original recommendation for water intake in 1945 by the Food and Nutrition Board of the United States National Research Council read|water
"""An ordinary standard for diverse persons is 1 milliliter for each calorie of food"|water
"Most of this quantity is contained in prepared foods."" The latest dietary reference intake report by the United States National Research Council in general recommended, based on the median total water intake from US survey data (including food sources)"|water
3.7 liters (0.81 imp gal; 0.98 U.S|water
gal) for men and 2.7 liters (0.59 imp gal; 0.71 U.S|water
gal) of water total for women, noting that water contained in food provided approximately 19% of total water intake in the survey.Specifically, pregnant and breastfeeding women need additional fluids to stay hydrated|water
The Institute of Medicine (US) recommends that, on average, men consume 3 liters (0.66 imp gal; 0.79 U.S|water
gal) and women 2.2 liters (0.48 imp gal; 0.58 U.S|water
gal); pregnant women should increase intake to 2.4 liters (0.53 imp gal; 0.63 U.S|water
gal) and breastfeeding women should get 3 liters (12 cups), since an especially large amount of fluid is lost during nursing|water
Also noted is that normally, about 20% of water intake comes from food, while the rest comes from drinking water and beverages (caffeinated included)|water
Water is excreted from the body in multiple forms; through urine and feces, through sweating, and by exhalation of water vapor in the breath|water
With physical exertion and heat exposure, water loss will increase and daily fluid needs may increase as well.|water
Humans require water with few impurities|water
Common impurities include metal salts and oxides, including copper, iron, calcium and lead, and/or harmful bacteria, such as Vibrio|water
Some solutes are acceptable and even desirable for taste enhancement and to provide needed electrolytes.The single largest (by volume) freshwater resource suitable for drinking is Lake Baikal in Siberia.|water
The propensity of water to form solutions and emulsions is useful in various washing processes|water
Washing is also an important component of several aspects of personal body hygiene|water
Most of the personal water use is due to showering, doing the laundry and dishwashing, reaching hundreds of liters per day per person in developed countries.|water
Water is widely used in chemical reactions as a solvent or reactant and less commonly as a solute or catalyst|water
In inorganic reactions, water is a common solvent, dissolving many ionic compounds, as well as other polar compounds such as ammonia and compounds closely related to water|water
In organic reactions, it is not usually used as a reaction solvent, because it does not dissolve the reactants well and is amphoteric (acidic and basic) and nucleophilic|water
Nevertheless, these properties are sometimes desirable|water
Also, acceleration of Diels-Alder reactions by water has been observed|water
Supercritical water has recently been a topic of research|water
Oxygen-saturated supercritical water combusts organic pollutants efficiently|water
Water vapor is used for some processes in the chemical industry|water
An example is the production of acrylic acid from acrolein, propylene and propane|water
The possible effect of water in these reactions includes the physical-, chemical interaction of water with the catalyst and the chemical reaction of water with the reaction intermediates.|water
Water and steam are a common fluid used for heat exchange, due to its availability and high heat capacity, both for cooling and heating|water
Cool water may even be naturally available from a lake or the sea|water
It's especially effective to transport heat through vaporization and condensation of water because of its large latent heat of vaporization|water
A disadvantage is that metals commonly found in industries such as steel and copper are oxidized faster by untreated water and steam|water
In almost all thermal power stations, water is used as the working fluid (used in a closed-loop between boiler, steam turbine, and condenser), and the coolant (used to exchange the waste heat to a water body or carry it away by evaporation in a cooling tower)|water
In the United States, cooling power plants is the largest use of water.In the nuclear power industry, water can also be used as a neutron moderator|water
In most nuclear reactors, water is both a coolant and a moderator|water
This provides something of a passive safety measure, as removing the water from the reactor also slows the nuclear reaction down|water
However other methods are favored for stopping a reaction and it is preferred to keep the nuclear core covered with water so as to ensure adequate cooling.|water
Water has a high heat of vaporization and is relatively inert, which makes it a good fire extinguishing fluid|water
The evaporation of water carries heat away from the fire|water
It is dangerous to use water on fires involving oils and organic solvents because many organic materials float on water and the water tends to spread the burning liquid.|water
The power of such explosions was seen in the Chernobyl disaster, although the water involved in this case did not come from fire-fighting but from the reactor's own water cooling system|water
A steam explosion occurred when the extreme overheating of the core caused water to flash into steam|water
A hydrogen explosion may have occurred as a result of a reaction between steam and hot zirconium.|water
Some metallic oxides, most notably those of alkali metals and alkaline earth metals, produce so much heat on reaction with water that a fire hazard can develop|water
The alkaline earth oxide quicklime is a mass-produced substance that is often transported in paper bags|water
If these are soaked through, they may ignite as their contents react with water.|water
Humans use water for many recreational purposes, as well as for exercising and for sports|water
Some of these include swimming, waterskiing, boating, surfing and diving|water
In addition, some sports, like ice hockey and ice skating, are played on ice|water
Lakesides, beaches and water parks are popular places for people to go to relax and enjoy recreation|water
Many find the sound and appearance of flowing water to be calming, and fountains and other water features are popular decorations|water
Some keep fish and other flora and fauna inside aquariums or ponds for show, fun, and companionship|water
Humans also use water for snow sports i.e|water
skiing, sledding, snowmobiling or snowboarding, which require the water to be frozen.|water
The water industry provides drinking water and wastewater services (including sewage treatment) to households and industry|water
Water supply facilities include water wells, cisterns for rainwater harvesting, water supply networks, and water purification facilities, water tanks, water towers, water pipes including old aqueducts|water
Atmospheric water generators are in development.|water
Drinking water is often collected at springs, extracted from artificial borings (wells) in the ground, or pumped from lakes and rivers|water
Building more wells in adequate places is thus a possible way to produce more water, assuming the aquifers can supply an adequate flow|water
Other water sources include rainwater collection|water
Water may require purification for human consumption|water
This may involve the removal of undissolved substances, dissolved substances and harmful microbes|water
Popular methods are filtering with sand which only removes undissolved material, while chlorination and boiling kill harmful microbes|water
Distillation does all three functions|water
More advanced techniques exist, such as reverse osmosis|water
Desalination of abundant seawater is a more expensive solution used in coastal arid climates.|water
The distribution of drinking water is done through municipal water systems, tanker delivery or as bottled water|water
Governments in many countries have programs to distribute water to the needy at no charge.|water
Reducing usage by using drinking (potable) water only for human consumption is another option|water
In some cities such as Hong Kong, seawater is extensively used for flushing toilets citywide in order to conserve freshwater resources.|water
Polluting water may be the biggest single misuse of water; to the extent that a pollutant limits other uses of the water, it becomes a waste of the resource, regardless of benefits to the polluter|water
Like other types of pollution, this does not enter standard accounting of market costs, being conceived as externalities for which the market cannot account|water
Thus other people pay the price of water pollution, while the private firms' profits are not redistributed to the local population, victims of this pollution|water
Pharmaceuticals consumed by humans often end up in the waterways and can have detrimental effects on aquatic life if they bioaccumulate and if they are not biodegradable.|water
Municipal and industrial wastewater are typically treated at wastewater treatment plants|water
Mitigation of polluted surface runoff is addressed through a variety of prevention and treatment techniques|water
(See Surface runoff#Mitigation and treatment.)|water
Many industrial processes rely on reactions using chemicals dissolved in water, suspension of solids in water slurries or using water to dissolve and extract substances, or to wash products or process equipment|water
Processes such as mining, chemical pulping, pulp bleaching, paper manufacturing, textile production, dyeing, printing, and cooling of power plants use large amounts of water, requiring a dedicated water source, and often cause significant water pollution.|water
Water is used in power generation|water
Hydroelectricity is electricity obtained from hydropower|water
Hydroelectric power comes from water driving a water turbine connected to a generator|water
Hydroelectricity is a low-cost, non-polluting, renewable energy source|water
The energy is supplied by the motion of water|water
Typically a dam is constructed on a river, creating an artificial lake behind it|water
Water flowing out of the lake is forced through turbines that turn generators.|water
Pressurized water is used in water blasting and water jet cutters|water
Also, high pressure water guns are used for precise cutting|water
It works very well, is relatively safe, and is not harmful to the environment|water
It is also used in the cooling of machinery to prevent overheating, or prevent saw blades from overheating.|water
Water is also used in many industrial processes and machines, such as the steam turbine and heat exchanger, in addition to its use as a chemical solvent|water
Discharge of untreated water from industrial uses is pollution|water
Pollution includes discharged solutes (chemical pollution) and discharged coolant water (thermal pollution)|water
Industry requires pure water for many applications and utilizes a variety of purification techniques both in water supply and discharge.|water
Boiling, steaming, and simmering are popular cooking methods that often require immersing food in water or its gaseous state, steam|water
Water is also used for dishwashing|water
Water also plays many critical roles within the field of food science.|water
Solutes such as salts and sugars found in water affect the physical properties of water|water
The boiling and freezing points of water are affected by solutes, as well as air pressure, which is in turn affected by altitude|water
Water boils at lower temperatures with the lower air pressure that occurs at higher elevations|water
One mole of sucrose (sugar) per kilogram of water raises the boiling point of water by 0.51 °C (0.918 °F), and one mole of salt per kg raises the boiling point by 1.02 °C (1.836 °F); similarly, increasing the number of dissolved particles lowers water's freezing point.Solutes in water also affect water activity that affects many chemical reactions and the growth of microbes in food|water
Water activity can be described as a ratio of the vapor pressure of water in a solution to the vapor pressure of pure water|water
Solutes in water lower water activity—this is important to know because most bacterial growth ceases at low levels of water activity|water
Not only does microbial growth affect the safety of food, but also the preservation and shelf life of food.|water
Water hardness is also a critical factor in food processing and may be altered or treated by using a chemical ion exchange system|water
It can dramatically affect the quality of a product, as well as playing a role in sanitation|water
Water hardness is classified based on concentration of calcium carbonate the water contains|water
Water is classified as soft if it contains less than 100 mg/l (UK) or less than 60 mg/l (US).According to a report published by the Water Footprint organization in 2010, a single kilogram of beef requires 15 thousand liters (3.3×10^3 imp gal; 4.0×10^3 U.S|water
gal) of water; however, the authors also make clear that this is a global average and circumstantial factors determine the amount of water used in beef production.|water
Much of the universe's water is produced as a byproduct of star formation|water
The formation of stars is accompanied by a strong outward wind of gas and dust|water
When this outflow of material eventually impacts the surrounding gas, the shock waves that are created compress and heat the gas|water
"The water observed is quickly produced in this warm dense gas.On 22 July 2011, a report described the discovery of a gigantic cloud of water vapor containing ""140 trillion times more water than all of Earth's oceans combined"" around a quasar located 12 billion light years from Earth"|water
"According to the researchers, the ""discovery shows that water has been prevalent in the universe for nearly its entire existence"".Water has been detected in interstellar clouds within our galaxy, the Milky Way"|water
Water probably exists in abundance in other galaxies, too, because its components, hydrogen, and oxygen, are among the most abundant elements in the universe|water
Based on models of the formation and evolution of the Solar System and that of other star systems, most other planetary systems are likely to have similar ingredients.|water
Atmosphere of the Sun|water
in detectable trace amounts|water
Atmosphere of Mercury|water
3.4%, and large amounts of water in Mercury's exosphere|water
Atmosphere of Venus|water
0.002%|water
Earth's atmosphere|water
≈0.40% over full atmosphere, typically 1–4% at surface; as well as that of the Moon in trace amounts|water
Atmosphere of Mars|water
0.03%|water
Atmosphere of Jupiter|water
0.0004% – in ices only; and that of its moon Europa|water
Atmosphere of Saturn – in ices only; Enceladus|water
91% and Dione (exosphere)|water
Extrasolar planet atmospheres|water
including those of HD 189733 b and HD 209458 b, Tau Boötis b, HAT-P-11b, XO-1b, WASP-12b, WASP-17b, and WASP-19b.|water
Stellar atmospheres|water
not limited to cooler stars and even detected in giant hot stars such as Betelgeuse, Mu Cephei, Antares and Arcturus.|water
Circumstellar disks|water
including those of more than half of T Tauri stars such as AA Tauri as well as TW Hydrae, IRC +10216 and APM 08279+5255, VY Canis Majoris and S Persei.|water
Liquid water is present on Earth, covering 71% of its surface|water
Liquid water is also occasionally present in small amounts on Mars|water
Scientists believe liquid water is present in the Saturnian moons of Enceladus, as a 10-kilometre thick ocean approximately 30–40 kilometres below Enceladus' south polar surface, and Titan, as a subsurface layer, possibly mixed with ammonia|water
Jupiter's moon Europa has surface characteristics which suggest a subsurface liquid water ocean|water
Liquid water may also exist on Jupiter's moon Ganymede as a layer sandwiched between high pressure ice and rock.|water
Mars|water
under the regolith and at the poles.|water
Earth–Moon system|water
mainly as ice sheets on Earth and in Lunar craters and volcanic rocks NASA reported the detection of water molecules by NASA's Moon Mineralogy Mapper aboard the Indian Space Research Organization's Chandrayaan-1 spacecraft in September 2009.|water
Jupiter's moons|water
Europa's surface and also that of Ganymede and Callisto|water
Saturn|water
in the planet's ring system and on the surface and mantle of Titan and Enceladus|water
The existence of liquid water, and to a lesser extent its gaseous and solid forms, on Earth are vital to the existence of life on Earth as we know it|water
The Earth is located in the habitable zone of the Solar System; if it were slightly closer to or farther from the Sun (about 5%, or about 8 million kilometers), the conditions which allow the three forms to be present simultaneously would be far less likely to exist.Earth's gravity allows it to hold an atmosphere|water
Water vapor and carbon dioxide in the atmosphere provide a temperature buffer (greenhouse effect) which helps maintain a relatively steady surface temperature|water
If Earth were smaller, a thinner atmosphere would allow temperature extremes, thus preventing the accumulation of water except in polar ice caps (as on Mars).The surface temperature of Earth has been relatively constant through geologic time despite varying levels of incoming solar radiation (insolation), indicating that a dynamic process governs Earth's temperature via a combination of greenhouse gases and surface or atmospheric albedo|water
This proposal is known as the Gaia hypothesis.The state of water on a planet depends on ambient pressure, which is determined by the planet's gravity|water
If a planet is sufficiently massive, the water on it may be solid even at high temperatures, because of the high pressure caused by gravity, as it was observed on exoplanets Gliese 436 b and GJ 1214 b.|water
Water politics is politics affected by water and water resources|water
For this reason, water is a strategic resource in the globe and an important element in many political conflicts|water
It causes health impacts and damage to biodiversity.|water
Access to safe drinking water has improved over the last decades in almost every part of the world, but approximately one billion people still lack access to safe water and over 2.5 billion lack access to adequate sanitation|water
However, some observers have estimated that by 2025 more than half of the world population will be facing water-based vulnerability|water
A report, issued in November 2009, suggests that by 2030, in some developing regions of the world, water demand will exceed supply by 50%.1.6 billion people have gained access to a safe water source since 1990|water
"The proportion of people in developing countries with access to safe water is calculated to have improved from 30% in 1970 to 71% in 1990, 79% in 2000 and 84% in 2004.A 2006 United Nations report stated that ""there is enough water for everyone"", but that access to it is hampered by mismanagement and corruption"|water
In addition, global initiatives to improve the efficiency of aid delivery, such as the Paris Declaration on Aid Effectiveness, have not been taken up by water sector donors as effectively as they have in education and health, potentially leaving multiple donors working on overlapping projects and recipient governments without empowerment to act.The authors of the 2007 Comprehensive Assessment of Water Management in Agriculture cited poor governance as one reason for some forms of water scarcity|water
Water governance is the set of formal and informal processes through which decisions related to water management are made|water
Good water governance is primarily about knowing what processes work best in a particular physical and socioeconomic context|water
Mistakes have sometimes been made by trying to apply 'blueprints' that work in the developed world to developing world locations and contexts|water
The Mekong river is one example; a review by the International Water Management Institute of policies in six countries that rely on the Mekong river for water found that thorough and transparent cost-benefit analyses and environmental impact assessments were rarely undertaken|water
They also discovered that Cambodia's draft water law was much more complex than it needed to be.The UN World Water Development Report (WWDR, 2003) from the World Water Assessment Program indicates that, in the next 20 years, the quantity of water available to everyone is predicted to decrease by 30%|water
40% of the world's inhabitants currently have insufficient fresh water for minimal hygiene|water
More than 2.2 million people died in 2000 from waterborne diseases (related to the consumption of contaminated water) or drought|water
In 2004, the UK charity WaterAid reported that a child dies every 15 seconds from easily preventable water-related diseases; often this means lack of sewage disposal.Organizations concerned with water protection include the International Water Association (IWA), WaterAid, Water 1st, and the American Water Resources Association|water
The International Water Management Institute undertakes projects with the aim of using effective water management to reduce poverty|water
Water related conventions are United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification (UNCCD), International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships, United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea and Ramsar Convention|water
World Day for Water takes place on 22 March and World Oceans Day on 8 June.|water
Water is considered a purifier in most religions|water
Faiths that incorporate ritual washing (ablution) include Christianity, Hinduism, Islam, Judaism, the Rastafari movement, Shinto, Taoism, and Wicca|water
Immersion (or aspersion or affusion) of a person in water is a central sacrament of Christianity (where it is called baptism); it is also a part of the practice of other religions, including Islam (Ghusl), Judaism (mikvah) and Sikhism (Amrit Sanskar)|water
In addition, a ritual bath in pure water is performed for the dead in many religions including Islam and Judaism|water
In Islam, the five daily prayers can be done in most cases after washing certain parts of the body using clean water (wudu), unless water is unavailable (see Tayammum)|water
In Shinto, water is used in almost all rituals to cleanse a person or an area (e.g., in the ritual of misogi).|water
The Ancient Greek philosopher Empedocles saw  water as one of the four classical elements (along with fire, earth, and air), and regarded it as an ylem, or basic substance of the universe|water
Thales, whom  Aristotle portrayed as an astronomer and an engineer, theorized that the earth, which is denser than water, emerged from the water|water
Thales, a monist, believed further that all things are made from water|water
Plato believed that the shape of water is an icosahedron - thus explaining why it flows easily compared to the cube-shaped earth.The theory of the four bodily humors associated water with phlegm, as being cold and moist|water
The  classical element of water was also one of the five elements in traditional Chinese philosophy (along with earth, fire, wood, and metal).|water
Some traditional and popular  Asian philosophical systems take water as a role-model|water
"James Legge's 1891 translation of the Dao De Jing states, ""The highest excellence is like (that of) water"|water
The excellence of water appears in its benefiting all things, and in its occupying, without striving (to the contrary), the low place which all men dislike|water
"Hence (its way) is near to (that of) the Tao"" and ""There is nothing in the world more soft and weak than water, and yet for attacking things that are firm and strong there is nothing that can take precedence of it—for there is nothing (so effectual) for which it can be changed."" Guanzi in the ""Shui di"" 水地 chapter further elaborates on the symbolism of water, proclaiming that ""man is water"" and attributing natural qualities of the people of different Chinese regions to the character of local water resources."|water
"""Living water"" features in Germanic and Slavic folktales as a means of bringing the dead back to life"|water
"Note the Grimm fairy-tale (""The Water of Life"") and the Russian dichotomy of living and dead water dead water)"|water
The Fountain of Youth represents a related concept of  magical waters allegedly preventing aging.|water
Painter and activist Fredericka Foster curated The Value of Water, at the Cathedral of St|water
John the Divine in New York City,  which anchored a year long initiative by the Cathedral on our dependence on water|water
The largest exhibition to ever appear at the Cathedral, it featured over forty artists, including Jenny Holzer, Robert Longo, Mark Rothko, William Kentridge, April Gornik, Kiki Smith, Pat Steir, William Kentridge, Alice Dalton Brown, Teresita Fernandez and Bill Viola|water
Foster created Think About Water, an ecological collective of artists who use water as their subject or medium|water
Members include Basia Irland, Aviva Rahmani, Betsy Damon, Diane Burko, Leila Daw, Stacy Levy, Charlotte Coté, Meridel Rubenstein, Stacy Levy, Anna Macleod, and Aviva Rahmani.|water
Water's technically correct but rarely used chemical name, dihydrogen monoxide, has been used in a series of hoaxes and pranks that mock scientific illiteracy|water
This began in 1983, when an April Fools' Day article appeared in a newspaper in Durand, Michigan|water
The false story consisted of safety concerns about the substance.|water
The Water Conflict Chronology|water
Water Conflict Database|water
Fire is hot because the conversion of the weak double bond in molecular oxygen, O2, to the stronger bonds in the combustion products carbon dioxide and water releases energy (418 kJ per 32 g of O2); the bond energies of the fuel play only a minor role here|fire
At a certain point in the combustion reaction, called the ignition point, flames are produced|fire
The flame is the visible portion of the fire|fire
Flames consist primarily of carbon dioxide, water vapor, oxygen and nitrogen|fire
If hot enough, the gases may become ionized to produce plasma|fire
Depending on the substances alight, and any impurities outside, the color of the flame and the fire's intensity will be different.|fire
Fire in its most common form can result in conflagration, which has the potential to cause physical damage through burning|fire
Fire is an important process that affects ecological systems around the globe|fire
The positive effects of fire include stimulating growth and maintaining various ecological systems.|fire
Its negative effects include hazard to life and property, atmospheric pollution, and water contamination|fire
If fire removes protective vegetation, heavy rainfall may lead to an increase in soil erosion by water|fire
Also, when vegetation is burned, the nitrogen it contains is released into the atmosphere, unlike elements such as potassium and phosphorus which remain in the ash and are quickly recycled into the soil|fire
"This loss of nitrogen caused by a fire produces a long-term reduction in the fertility of the soil, but this fecundity can potentially be recovered as molecular nitrogen in the atmosphere is ""fixed"" and converted to ammonia by natural phenomena such as lightning and by leguminous plants that are ""nitrogen-fixing"" such as clover, peas, and green beans."|fire
Fires start when a flammable or a combustible material, in combination with a sufficient quantity of an oxidizer such as oxygen gas or another oxygen-rich compound (though non-oxygen oxidizers exist), is exposed to a source of heat or ambient temperature above the flash point for the fuel/oxidizer mix, and is able to sustain a rate of rapid oxidation that produces a chain reaction|fire
This is commonly called the fire tetrahedron|fire
Fire cannot exist without all of these elements in place and in the right proportions|fire
For example, a flammable liquid will start burning only if the fuel and oxygen are in the right proportions|fire
Some fuel-oxygen mixes may require a catalyst, a substance that is not consumed, when added, in any chemical reaction during combustion, but which enables the reactants to combust more readily.|fire
If the oxidizer is oxygen from the surrounding air, the presence of a force of gravity, or of some similar force caused by acceleration, is necessary to produce convection, which removes combustion products and brings a supply of oxygen to the fire|fire
Without gravity, a fire rapidly surrounds itself with its own combustion products and non-oxidizing gases from the air, which exclude oxygen and extinguish the fire|fire
Because of this, the risk of fire in a spacecraft is small when it is coasting in inertial flight|fire
This does not apply if oxygen is supplied to the fire by some process other than thermal convection.|fire
Fire can be extinguished by removing any one of the elements of the fire tetrahedron|fire
Consider a natural gas flame, such as from a stove-top burner|fire
The fire can be extinguished by any of the following:|fire
application of a retardant chemical such as Halon to the flame, which retards the chemical reaction itself until the rate of combustion is too slow to maintain the chain reaction.In contrast, fire is intensified by increasing the overall rate of combustion|fire
Methods to do this include balancing the input of fuel and oxidizer to stoichiometric proportions, increasing fuel and oxidizer input in this balanced mix, increasing the ambient temperature so the fire's own heat is better able to sustain combustion, or providing a catalyst, a non-reactant medium in which the fuel and oxidizer can more readily react.|fire
A flame is a mixture of reacting gases and solids emitting visible, infrared, and sometimes ultraviolet light, the frequency spectrum of which depends on the chemical composition of the burning material and intermediate reaction products|fire
"In many cases, such as the burning of organic matter, for example wood, or the incomplete combustion of gas, incandescent solid particles called soot produce the familiar red-orange glow of ""fire"""|fire
This light has a continuous spectrum|fire
Complete combustion of gas has a dim blue color due to the emission of single-wavelength radiation from various electron transitions in the excited molecules formed in the flame|fire
Usually oxygen is involved, but hydrogen burning in chlorine also produces a flame, producing hydrogen chloride (HCl)|fire
Other possible combinations producing flames, amongst many, are fluorine and hydrogen, and hydrazine and nitrogen tetroxide|fire
"Hydrogen and hydrazine/UDMH flames are similarly pale blue, while burning boron and its compounds, evaluated in mid-20th century as a high energy fuel for jet and rocket engines, emits intense green flame, leading to its informal nickname of ""Green Dragon""."|fire
The glow of a flame is complex|fire
Black-body radiation is emitted from soot, gas, and fuel particles, though the soot particles are too small to behave like perfect blackbodies|fire
There is also photon emission by de-excited atoms and molecules in the gases|fire
Much of the radiation is emitted in the visible and infrared bands|fire
The color depends on temperature for the black-body radiation, and on chemical makeup for the emission spectra|fire
The dominant color in a flame changes with temperature|fire
The photo of the forest fire in Canada is an excellent example of this variation|fire
Near the ground, where most burning is occurring, the fire is white, the hottest color possible for organic material in general, or yellow|fire
Above the yellow region, the color changes to orange, which is cooler, then red, which is cooler still|fire
Above the red region, combustion no longer occurs, and the uncombusted carbon particles are visible as black smoke.|fire
The common distribution of a flame under normal gravity conditions depends on convection, as soot tends to rise to the top of a general flame, as in a candle in normal gravity conditions, making it yellow|fire
In micro gravity or zero gravity, such as an environment in outer space, convection no longer occurs, and the flame becomes spherical, with a tendency to become more blue and more efficient (although it may go out if not moved steadily, as the CO2 from combustion does not disperse as readily in micro gravity, and tends to smother the flame)|fire
There are several possible explanations for this difference, of which the most likely is that the temperature is sufficiently evenly distributed that soot is not formed and complete combustion occurs|fire
Experiments by NASA reveal that diffusion flames in micro gravity allow more soot to be completely oxidized after they are produced than diffusion flames on Earth, because of a series of mechanisms that behave differently in micro gravity when compared to normal gravity conditions|fire
These discoveries have potential applications in applied science and industry, especially concerning fuel efficiency.|fire
In combustion engines, various steps are taken to eliminate a flame|fire
The method depends mainly on whether the fuel is oil, wood, or a high-energy fuel such as jet fuel.|fire
Every natural ecosystem has its own fire regime, and the organisms in those ecosystems are adapted to or dependent upon that fire regime|fire
Fire creates a mosaic of different habitat patches, each at a different stage of succession|fire
Different species of plants, animals, and microbes specialize in exploiting a particular stage, and by creating these different types of patches, fire allows a greater number of species to exist within a landscape.|fire
Fire science is a branch of physical science which includes fire behavior, dynamics, and combustion|fire
Applications of fire science include fire protection, fire investigation, and wildfire management.|fire
The fossil record of fire first appears with the establishment of a land-based flora in the Middle Ordovician period, 470 million years ago, permitting the accumulation of oxygen in the atmosphere as never before, as the new hordes of land plants pumped it out as a waste product|fire
When this concentration rose above 13%, it permitted the possibility of wildfire|fire
Wildfire is first recorded in the Late Silurian fossil record, 420 million years ago, by fossils of charcoalified plants|fire
Apart from a controversial gap in the Late Devonian, charcoal is present ever since|fire
The level of atmospheric oxygen is closely related to the prevalence of charcoal|fire
clearly oxygen is the key factor in the abundance of wildfire|fire
Fire also became more abundant when grasses radiated and became the dominant component of many ecosystems, around 6 to 7 million years ago; this kindling provided tinder which allowed for the more rapid spread of fire|fire
These widespread fires may have initiated a positive feedback process, whereby they produced a warmer, drier climate more conducive to fire.|fire
The ability to control fire was a dramatic change in the habits of early humans|fire
Making fire to generate heat and light made it possible for people to cook food, simultaneously increasing the variety and availability of nutrients and reducing disease by killing organisms in the food|fire
The heat produced would also help people stay warm in cold weather, enabling them to live in cooler climates|fire
Fire also kept nocturnal predators at bay|fire
Evidence of cooked food is found from 1 million years ago, although fire was probably not used in a controlled fashion until 400,000 years ago|fire
There is some evidence that fire may have been used in a controlled fashion about 1 million years ago|fire
Evidence becomes widespread around 50 to 100 thousand years ago, suggesting regular use from this time; interestingly, resistance to air pollution started to evolve in human populations at a similar point in time|fire
The use of fire became progressively more sophisticated, with it being used to create charcoal and to control wildlife from 'tens of thousands' of years ago.Fire has also been used for centuries as a method of torture and execution, as evidenced by death by burning as well as torture devices such as the iron boot, which could be filled with water, oil, or even lead and then heated over an open fire to the agony of the wearer.|fire
By the Neolithic Revolution, during the introduction of grain-based agriculture, people all over the world used fire as a tool in landscape management|fire
"These fires were typically controlled burns or ""cool fires"", as opposed to uncontrolled ""hot fires"", which damage the soil"|fire
Hot fires destroy plants and animals, and endanger communities|fire
This is especially a problem in the forests of today where traditional burning is prevented in order to encourage the growth of timber crops|fire
Cool fires are generally conducted in the spring and autumn|fire
They clear undergrowth, burning up biomass that could trigger a hot fire should it get too dense|fire
They provide a greater variety of environments, which encourages game and plant diversity|fire
For humans, they make dense, impassable forests traversable|fire
Another human use for fire in regards to landscape management is its use to clear land for agriculture|fire
Slash-and-burn agriculture is still common across much of tropical Africa, Asia and South America|fire
"""For small farmers, it is a convenient way to clear overgrown areas and release nutrients from standing vegetation back into the soil"", said Miguel Pinedo-Vasquez, an ecologist at the Earth Institute’s Center for Environmental Research and Conservation"|fire
However this useful strategy is also problematic|fire
Growing population, fragmentation of forests and warming climate are making the earth's surface more prone to ever-larger escaped fires|fire
These harm ecosystems and human infrastructure, cause health problems, and send up spirals of carbon and soot that may encourage even more warming of the atmosphere – and thus feed back into more fires|fire
Globally today, as much as 5 million square kilometres – an area more than half the size of the United States – burns in a given year.|fire
There are numerous modern applications of fire|fire
In its broadest sense, fire is used by nearly every human being on earth in a controlled setting every day|fire
Users of internal combustion vehicles employ fire every time they drive|fire
Thermal power stations provide electricity for a large percentage of humanity by igniting fuels such as coal, oil or natural gas, then using the resultant heat to boil water into steam, which then drives turbines.|fire
The use of fire in warfare has a long history|fire
Fire was the basis of all early thermal weapons|fire
Homer detailed the use of fire by Greek soldiers who hid in a wooden horse to burn Troy during the Trojan war|fire
Later the Byzantine fleet used Greek fire to attack ships and men|fire
In the First World War, the first modern flamethrowers were used by infantry, and were successfully mounted on armoured vehicles in the Second World War|fire
In the latter war, incendiary bombs were used by Axis and Allies alike, notably on Tokyo, Rotterdam, London, Hamburg and, notoriously, at Dresden; in the latter two cases firestorms were deliberately caused in which a ring of fire surrounding each city was drawn inward by an updraft caused by a central cluster of fires|fire
The United States Army Air Force also extensively used incendiaries against Japanese targets in the latter months of the war, devastating entire cities constructed primarily of wood and paper houses|fire
The use of napalm was employed in July 1944, towards the end of the Second World War; although its use did not gain public attention until the Vietnam War|fire
Molotov cocktails were also used.|fire
Setting fuel aflame releases usable energy|fire
Wood was a prehistoric fuel, and is still viable today|fire
The use of fossil fuels, such as petroleum, natural gas, and coal, in power plants supplies the vast majority of the world's electricity today; the International Energy Agency states that nearly 80% of the world's power came from these sources in 2002|fire
The fire in a power station is used to heat water, creating steam that drives turbines|fire
The turbines then spin an electric generator to produce electricity|fire
Fire is also used to provide mechanical work directly, in both external and internal combustion engines.|fire
Deftly controlling a fire to optimize its size, shape, and intensity is generally called fire management, and the more advanced forms of it, as traditionally (and sometimes still) practiced by skilled cooks, blacksmiths, ironmasters, and others, are highly skilled activities|fire
They include knowledge about selecting which types of wood, charcoal, or mineral coal to burn; how to arrange the fuel; how to stoke the fire both in early phases and in maintenance phases; how to modulate the amount of heat, flames, and smoke as suited to the desired application; how best to bank a fire to be revived later; how to choose, design, or modify woodstoves, coalstoves, bakery ovens, and industrial furnaces; and so on|fire
Detailed expositions of fire management are available in various books about blacksmithing, about skilled camping or military scouting, and about the domestic arts in previous centuries.|fire
Wildfire prevention programs around the world may employ techniques such as wildland fire use and prescribed or controlled burns|fire
Wildland fire use refers to any fire of natural causes that is monitored but allowed to burn|fire
Controlled burns are fires ignited by government agencies under less dangerous weather conditions.Fire fighting services are provided in most developed areas to extinguish or contain uncontrolled fires|fire
Trained firefighters use fire apparatus, water supply resources such as water mains and fire hydrants or they might use A and B class foam depending on what is feeding the fire.|fire
Fire prevention is intended to reduce sources of ignition|fire
Fire prevention also includes education to teach people how to avoid causing fires|fire
Buildings, especially schools and tall buildings, often conduct fire drills to inform and prepare citizens on how to react to a building fire|fire
Purposely starting destructive fires constitutes arson and is a crime in most jurisdictions.Model building codes require passive fire protection and active fire protection systems to minimize damage resulting from a fire|fire
The most common form of active fire protection is fire sprinklers|fire
To maximize passive fire protection of buildings, building materials and furnishings in most developed countries are tested for fire-resistance, combustibility and flammability|fire
Upholstery, carpeting and plastics used in vehicles and vessels are also tested.|fire
Different restoration methods and measures are used depending on the type of fire damage that occurred|fire
Restoration after fire damage can be performed by property management teams, building maintenance personnel, or by the homeowners themselves; however, contacting a certified professional fire damage restoration specialist is often regarded as the safest way to restore fire damaged property due to their training and extensive experience|fire
"Most are usually listed under ""Fire and Water Restoration"" and they can help speed repairs, whether for individual homeowners or for the largest of institutions.Fire and Water Restoration companies are regulated by the appropriate state's Department of Consumer Affairs – usually the state contractors license board"|fire
In California, all Fire and Water Restoration companies must register with the California Contractors State License Board|fire
"Presently, the California Contractors State License Board has no specific classification for ""water and fire damage restoration."" Hence, the Contractor's State License Board requires both an asbestos certification (ASB) as well as a demolition classification (C-21) in order to perform Fire and Water Restoration work."|fire

from The Straight Dope|fire
"""20 Things You Didn't Know About.."|fire
"Fire"" from Discover magazine"|fire
The atmosphere of Earth, commonly known as air, is the layer of gases retained by Earth's gravity that surrounds the planet and forms its planetary atmosphere|air
The atmosphere of Earth protects life on Earth by creating pressure allowing for liquid water to exist on the Earth's surface, absorbing ultraviolet solar radiation, warming the surface through heat retention (greenhouse effect), and reducing temperature extremes between day and night (the diurnal temperature variation).|air
By mole fraction (i.e., by number of molecules), dry air contains 78.08% nitrogen, 20.95% oxygen, 0.93% argon, 0.04% carbon dioxide, and small amounts of other gases|air
Air also contains a variable amount of water vapor, on average around 1% at sea level, and 0.4% over the entire atmosphere|air
Air composition, temperature, and atmospheric pressure vary with altitude|air
Within the atmosphere, air suitable for use in photosynthesis by terrestrial plants and breathing of terrestrial animals is found only in Earth's troposphere.Earth's early atmosphere consisted of gases in the solar nebula, primarily hydrogen|air
The atmosphere changed significantly over time, affected by many factors such as volcanism, life, and weathering|air
Recently, human activity has also contributed to atmospheric changes, such as global warming, ozone depletion and acid deposition.|air
The atmosphere has a mass of about 5.15×1018 kg, three quarters of which is within about 11 km (6.8 mi; 36,000 ft) of the surface|air
The atmosphere becomes thinner with increasing altitude, with no definite boundary between the atmosphere and outer space|air
The Kármán line, at 100 km (62 mi) or 1.57% of Earth's radius, is often used as the border between the atmosphere and outer space|air
Atmospheric effects become noticeable during atmospheric reentry of spacecraft at an altitude of around 120 km (75 mi)|air
Several layers can be distinguished in the atmosphere, based on characteristics such as temperature and composition.|air
The study of Earth's atmosphere and its processes is called atmospheric science (aerology), and includes multiple subfields, such as climatology and atmospheric physics|air
Early pioneers in the field include Léon Teisserenc de Bort and Richard Assmann|air
The study of historic atmosphere is called paleoclimatology.|air
The three major constituents of Earth's atmosphere are nitrogen, oxygen, and argon|air
Water vapor accounts for roughly 0.25% of the atmosphere by mass|air
The concentration of water vapor (a greenhouse gas) varies significantly from around 10 ppm by mole fraction in the coldest portions of the atmosphere to as much as 5% by mole fraction in hot, humid air masses, and concentrations of other atmospheric gases are typically quoted in terms of dry air (without water vapor).|air
8  The remaining gases are often referred to as trace gases, among which are other greenhouse gases, principally carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide, and ozone|air
Besides argon, already mentioned, other noble gases, neon, helium, krypton, and xenon are also present|air
Filtered air includes trace amounts of many other chemical compounds|air
Many substances of natural origin may be present in locally and seasonally variable small amounts as aerosols in an unfiltered air sample, including dust of mineral and organic composition, pollen and spores, sea spray, and volcanic ash|air
Various industrial pollutants also may be present as gases or aerosols, such as chlorine (elemental or in compounds), fluorine compounds and elemental mercury vapor|air
Sulfur compounds such as hydrogen sulfide and sulfur dioxide (SO2) may be derived from natural sources or from industrial air pollution.|air
The average molecular weight of dry air, which can be used to calculate densities or to convert between mole fraction and mass fraction, is about 28.946 or 28.96 g/mol|air
This is decreased when the air is humid.|air
In general, air pressure and density decrease with altitude in the atmosphere|air
However, the temperature has a more complicated profile with altitude, and may remain relatively constant or even increase with altitude in some regions (see the temperature section, below)|air
Because the general pattern of the temperature/altitude profile, or lapse rate, is constant and measurable by means of instrumented balloon soundings, the temperature behavior provides a useful metric to distinguish atmospheric layers|air
In this way, Earth's atmosphere can be divided (called atmospheric stratification) into five main layers|air
troposphere, stratosphere, mesosphere, thermosphere, and exosphere|air
The altitudes of the five layers are as follows:|air
Exosphere|air
700 to 10,000 km (440 to 6,200 miles)|air
Thermosphere|air
80 to 700 km (50 to 440 miles)|air
Mesosphere|air
50 to 80 km (31 to 50 miles)|air
Stratosphere|air
12 to 50 km (7 to 31 miles)|air
Troposphere|air
0 to 12 km (0 to 7 miles)|air
The exosphere is the outermost layer of Earth's atmosphere (i.e|air
the upper limit of the atmosphere)|air
It extends from the thermopause, at the top of the thermosphere at an altitude of about 700 km above sea level, to about 10,000 km (6,200 mi; 33,000,000 ft), where it merges into the solar wind.|air
This layer is mainly composed of extremely low densities of hydrogen, helium and several heavier molecules including nitrogen, oxygen and carbon dioxide closer to the exobase|air
The atoms and molecules are so far apart that they can travel hundreds of kilometers without colliding with one another|air
Thus, the exosphere no longer behaves like a gas, and the particles constantly escape into space|air
These free-moving particles follow ballistic trajectories and may migrate in and out of the magnetosphere or the solar wind.|air
The exosphere is too far above Earth for meteorological phenomena to be possible|air
However, Earth's auroras—the aurora borealis (northern lights) and aurora australis (southern lights)—sometimes occur in the lower part of the exosphere, where they overlap into the thermosphere|air
The exosphere contains many of the artificial satellites that orbit Earth.|air
The thermosphere is the second-highest layer of Earth's atmosphere|air
It extends from the mesopause (which separates it from the mesosphere) at an altitude of about 80 km (50 mi; 260,000 ft) up to the thermopause at an altitude range of 500–1000 km (310–620 mi; 1,600,000–3,300,000 ft)|air
The height of the thermopause varies considerably due to changes in solar activity|air
Because the thermopause lies at the lower boundary of the exosphere, it is also referred to as the exobase|air
The lower part of the thermosphere, from 80 to 550 kilometres (50 to 342 mi) above Earth's surface, contains the ionosphere.|air
The temperature of the thermosphere gradually increases with height and can rise as high as 1500 °C (2700 °F), though the gas molecules are so far apart that its temperature in the usual sense is not very meaningful|air
The air is so rarefied that an individual molecule (of oxygen, for example) travels an average of 1 kilometre (0.62 mi; 3300 ft) between collisions with other molecules|air
Although the thermosphere has a high proportion of molecules with high energy, it would not feel hot to a human in direct contact, because its density is too low to conduct a significant amount of energy to or from the skin.|air
This layer is completely cloudless and free of water vapor|air
However, non-hydrometeorological phenomena such as the aurora borealis and aurora australis are occasionally seen in the thermosphere|air
The International Space Station orbits in this layer, between 350 and 420 km (220 and 260 mi)|air
It is this layer where many of the satellites orbiting the earth are present.|air
The mesosphere is the third highest layer of Earth's atmosphere, occupying the region above the stratosphere and below the thermosphere|air
It extends from the stratopause at an altitude of about 50 km (31 mi; 160,000 ft) to the mesopause at 80–85 km (50–53 mi; 260,000–280,000 ft) above sea level.|air
Temperatures drop with increasing altitude to the mesopause that marks the top of this middle layer of the atmosphere|air
It is the coldest place on Earth and has an average temperature around −85 °C (−120 °F; 190 K).Just below the mesopause, the air is so cold that even the very scarce water vapor at this altitude can sublimate into polar-mesospheric noctilucent clouds|air
These are the highest clouds in the atmosphere and may be visible to the naked eye if sunlight reflects off them about an hour or two after sunset or similarly before sunrise|air
They are most readily visible when the Sun is around 4 to 16 degrees below the horizon|air
Lightning-induced discharges known as transient luminous events (TLEs) occasionally form in the mesosphere above tropospheric thunderclouds|air
The mesosphere is also the layer where most meteors burn up upon atmospheric entrance|air
It is too high above Earth to be accessible to jet-powered aircraft and balloons, and too low to permit orbital spacecraft|air
The mesosphere is mainly accessed by sounding rockets and rocket-powered aircraft.|air
The stratosphere is the second-lowest layer of Earth's atmosphere|air
It lies above the troposphere and is separated from it by the tropopause|air
This layer extends from the top of the troposphere at roughly 12 km (7.5 mi; 39,000 ft) above Earth's surface to the stratopause at an altitude of about 50 to 55 km (31 to 34 mi; 164,000 to 180,000 ft).|air
The atmospheric pressure at the top of the stratosphere is roughly 1/1000 the pressure at sea level|air
It contains the ozone layer, which is the part of Earth's atmosphere that contains relatively high concentrations of that gas|air
The stratosphere defines a layer in which temperatures rise with increasing altitude|air
This rise in temperature is caused by the absorption of ultraviolet radiation (UV) radiation from the Sun by the ozone layer, which restricts turbulence and mixing|air
Although the temperature may be −60 °C (−76 °F; 210 K) at the tropopause, the top of the stratosphere is much warmer, and may be near 0 °C.The stratospheric temperature profile creates very stable atmospheric conditions, so the stratosphere lacks the weather-producing air turbulence that is so prevalent in the troposphere|air
Consequently, the stratosphere is almost completely free of clouds and other forms of weather|air
However, polar stratospheric or nacreous clouds are occasionally seen in the lower part of this layer of the atmosphere where the air is coldest|air
The stratosphere is the highest layer that can be accessed by jet-powered aircraft.|air
The troposphere is the lowest layer of Earth's atmosphere|air
It extends from Earth's surface to an average height of about 12 km (7.5 mi; 39,000 ft), although this altitude varies from about 9 km (5.6 mi; 30,000 ft) at the geographic poles to 17 km (11 mi; 56,000 ft) at the Equator, with some variation due to weather|air
The troposphere is bounded above by the tropopause, a boundary marked in most places by a temperature inversion (i.e|air
a layer of relatively warm air above a colder one), and in others by a zone that is isothermal with height.Although variations do occur, the temperature usually declines with increasing altitude in the troposphere because the troposphere is mostly heated through energy transfer from the surface|air
Thus, the lowest part of the troposphere (i.e|air
Earth's surface) is typically the warmest section of the troposphere|air
"This promotes vertical mixing (hence, the origin of its name in the Greek word τρόπος, tropos, meaning ""turn"")"|air
The troposphere contains roughly 80% of the mass of Earth's atmosphere|air
The troposphere is denser than all its overlying layers because a larger atmospheric weight sits on top of the troposphere and causes it to be most severely compressed|air
Fifty percent of the total mass of the atmosphere is located in the lower 5.6 km (3.5 mi; 18,000 ft) of the troposphere.|air
Nearly all atmospheric water vapor or moisture is found in the troposphere, so it is the layer where most of Earth's weather takes place|air
It has basically all the weather-associated cloud genus types generated by active wind circulation, although very tall cumulonimbus thunder clouds can penetrate the tropopause from below and rise into the lower part of the stratosphere|air
Most conventional aviation activity takes place in the troposphere, and it is the only layer that can be accessed by propeller-driven aircraft.|air
The ozone layer is contained within the stratosphere|air
In this layer ozone concentrations are about 2 to 8 parts per million, which is much higher than in the lower atmosphere but still very small compared to the main components of the atmosphere|air
It is mainly located in the lower portion of the stratosphere from about 15–35 km (9.3–21.7 mi; 49,000–115,000 ft), though the thickness varies seasonally and geographically|air
About 90% of the ozone in Earth's atmosphere is contained in the stratosphere.|air
The ionosphere is a region of the atmosphere that is ionized by solar radiation|air
It is responsible for auroras|air
During daytime hours, it stretches from 50 to 1,000 km (31 to 621 mi; 160,000 to 3,280,000 ft) and includes the mesosphere, thermosphere, and parts of the exosphere|air
However, ionization in the mesosphere largely ceases during the night, so auroras are normally seen only in the thermosphere and lower exosphere|air
The ionosphere forms the inner edge of the magnetosphere|air
It has practical importance because it influences, for example, radio propagation on Earth.|air
The homosphere and heterosphere are defined by whether the atmospheric gases are well mixed|air
The surface-based homosphere includes the troposphere, stratosphere, mesosphere, and the lowest part of the thermosphere, where the chemical composition of the atmosphere does not depend on molecular weight because the gases are mixed by turbulence|air
This relatively homogeneous layer ends at the turbopause found at about 100 km (62 mi; 330,000 ft), the very edge of space itself as accepted by the FAI, which places it about 20 km (12 mi; 66,000 ft) above the mesopause.Above this altitude lies the heterosphere, which includes the exosphere and most of the thermosphere|air
Here, the chemical composition varies with altitude|air
This is because the distance that particles can move without colliding with one another is large compared with the size of motions that cause mixing|air
This allows the gases to stratify by molecular weight, with the heavier ones, such as oxygen and nitrogen, present only near the bottom of the heterosphere|air
The upper part of the heterosphere is composed almost completely of hydrogen, the lightest element.The planetary boundary layer is the part of the troposphere that is closest to Earth's surface and is directly affected by it, mainly through turbulent diffusion|air
During the day the planetary boundary layer usually is well-mixed, whereas at night it becomes stably stratified with weak or intermittent mixing|air
The depth of the planetary boundary layer ranges from as little as about 100 metres (330 ft) on clear, calm nights to 3,000 m (9,800 ft) or more during the afternoon in dry regions.The average temperature of the atmosphere at Earth's surface is 14 °C (57 °F; 287 K) or 15 °C (59 °F; 288 K), depending on the reference.|air
The average atmospheric pressure at sea level is defined by the International Standard Atmosphere as 101325 pascals (760.00 Torr; 14.6959 psi; 760.00 mmHg)|air
This is sometimes referred to as a unit of standard atmospheres (atm)|air
Total atmospheric mass is 5.1480×1018 kg (1.135×1019 lb), about 2.5% less than would be inferred from the average sea level pressure and Earth's area of 51007.2 megahectares, this portion being displaced by Earth's mountainous terrain|air
Atmospheric pressure is the total weight of the air above unit area at the point where the pressure is measured|air
Thus air pressure varies with location and weather.|air
If the entire mass of the atmosphere had a uniform density equal to sea level density (about 1.2 kg per m3) from sea level upwards, it would terminate abruptly at an altitude of 8.50 km (27,900 ft)|air
It actually decreases exponentially with altitude, dropping by half every 5.6 km (18,000 ft) or by a factor of 1/e every 7.64 km (25,100 ft), the average scale height of the atmosphere below 70 km (43 mi; 230,000 ft)|air
However, the atmosphere is more accurately modeled with a customized equation for each layer that takes gradients of temperature, molecular composition, solar radiation and gravity into account.|air
99.99997% is below 100 km (62 mi; 330,000 ft), the Kármán line|air
By international convention, this marks the beginning of space where human travelers are considered astronauts.By comparison, the summit of Mt|air
Everest is at 8,848 m (29,029 ft);|air
Even above the Kármán line, significant atmospheric effects such as auroras still occur|air
Meteors begin to glow in this region, though the larger ones may not burn up until they penetrate more deeply|air
The various layers of Earth's ionosphere, important to HF radio propagation, begin below 100 km and extend beyond 500 km|air
By comparison, the International Space Station and Space Shuttle typically orbit at 350–400 km, within the F-layer of the ionosphere where they encounter enough atmospheric drag to require reboosts every few months, otherwise, orbital decay will occur resulting in a return to Earth|air
Depending on solar activity, satellites can experience noticeable atmospheric drag at altitudes as high as 700–800 km.|air
The division of the atmosphere into layers mostly by reference to temperature is discussed above|air
Temperature decreases with altitude starting at sea level, but variations in this trend begin above 11 km, where the temperature stabilizes over a large vertical distance through the rest of the troposphere|air
In the stratosphere, starting above about 20 km, the temperature increases with height, due to heating within the ozone layer caused by the capture of significant ultraviolet radiation from the Sun by the dioxygen and ozone gas in this region|air
Still another region of increasing temperature with altitude occurs at very high altitudes, in the aptly-named thermosphere above 90 km.|air
The density of air at sea level is about 1.2 kg/m3 (1.2 g/L, 0.0012 g/cm3)|air
Density is not measured directly but is calculated from measurements of temperature, pressure and humidity using the equation of state for air (a form of the ideal gas law)|air
Atmospheric density decreases as the altitude increases|air
This variation can be approximately modeled using the barometric formula|air
More sophisticated models are used to predict the orbital decay of satellites.|air
The average mass of the atmosphere is about 5 quadrillion (5×1015) tonnes or 1/1,200,000 the mass of Earth|air
"According to the American National Center for Atmospheric Research, ""The total mean mass of the atmosphere is 5.1480×1018 kg with an annual range due to water vapor of 1.2 or 1.5×1015 kg, depending on whether surface pressure or water vapor data are used; somewhat smaller than the previous estimate"|air
"The mean mass of water vapor is estimated as 1.27×1016 kg and the dry air mass as 5.1352 ±0.0003×1018 kg."""|air
Solar radiation (or sunlight) is the energy Earth receives from the Sun|air
Earth also emits radiation back into space, but at longer wavelengths that humans cannot see|air
Part of the incoming and emitted radiation is absorbed or reflected by the atmosphere|air
In May 2017, glints of light, seen as twinkling from an orbiting satellite a million miles away, were found to be reflected light from ice crystals in the atmosphere.|air
When light passes through Earth's atmosphere, photons interact with it through scattering|air
If the light does not interact with the atmosphere, it is called direct radiation and is what you see if you were to look directly at the Sun|air
Indirect radiation is light that has been scattered in the atmosphere|air
For example, on an overcast day when you cannot see your shadow, there is no direct radiation reaching you, it has all been scattered|air
As another example, due to a phenomenon called Rayleigh scattering, shorter (blue) wavelengths scatter more easily than longer (red) wavelengths|air
This is why the sky looks blue; you are seeing scattered blue light|air
This is also why sunsets are red|air
Because the Sun is close to the horizon, the Sun's rays pass through more atmosphere than normal before reaching your eye|air
Much of the blue light has been scattered out, leaving the red light in a sunset.|air
Different molecules absorb different wavelengths of radiation|air
For example, O2 and O3 absorb almost all radiation with wavelengths shorter than 300 nanometers|air
Water (H2O) absorbs at many wavelengths above 700 nm|air
When a molecule absorbs a photon, it increases the energy of the molecule|air
This heats the atmosphere, but the atmosphere also cools by emitting radiation, as discussed below.|air
"The combined absorption spectra of the gases in the atmosphere leave ""windows"" of low opacity, allowing the transmission of only certain bands of light"|air
The optical window runs from around 300 nm (ultraviolet-C) up into the range humans can see, the visible spectrum (commonly called light), at roughly 400–700 nm and continues to the infrared to around 1100 nm|air
There are also infrared and radio windows that transmit some infrared and radio waves at longer wavelengths|air
For example, the radio window runs from about one centimeter to about eleven-meter waves.|air
Emission is the opposite of absorption, it is when an object emits radiation|air
"Objects tend to emit amounts and wavelengths of radiation depending on their ""black body"" emission curves, therefore hotter objects tend to emit more radiation, with shorter wavelengths"|air
Colder objects emit less radiation, with longer wavelengths|air
For example, the Sun is approximately 6,000 K (5,730 °C; 10,340 °F), its radiation peaks near 500 nm, and is visible to the human eye|air
Earth is approximately 290 K (17 °C; 62 °F), so its radiation peaks near 10,000 nm, and is much too long to be visible to humans.|air
Because of its temperature, the atmosphere emits infrared radiation|air
For example, on clear nights Earth's surface cools down faster than on cloudy nights|air
This is because clouds (H2O) are strong absorbers and emitters of infrared radiation|air
This is also why it becomes colder at night at higher elevations.|air
The greenhouse effect is directly related to this absorption and emission effect|air
Some gases in the atmosphere absorb and emit infrared radiation, but do not interact with sunlight in the visible spectrum|air
Common examples of these are CO2 and H2O.|air
The refractive index of air is close to, but just greater than 1|air
Systematic variations in the refractive index can lead to the bending of light rays over long optical paths|air
One example is that, under some circumstances, observers onboard ships can see other vessels just over the horizon because light is refracted in the same direction as the curvature of Earth's surface.|air
The refractive index of air depends on temperature, giving rise to refraction effects when the temperature gradient is large|air
An example of such effects is the mirage.|air
Atmospheric circulation is the large-scale movement of air through the troposphere, and the means (with ocean circulation) by which heat is distributed around Earth|air
The large-scale structure of the atmospheric circulation varies from year to year, but the basic structure remains fairly constant because it is determined by Earth's rotation rate and the difference in solar radiation between the equator and poles.|air
The first atmosphere consisted of gases in the solar nebula, primarily hydrogen|air
There were probably simple hydrides such as those now found in the gas giants (Jupiter and Saturn), notably water vapor, methane and ammonia.|air
Outgassing from volcanism, supplemented by gases produced during the late heavy bombardment of Earth by huge asteroids, produced the next atmosphere, consisting largely of nitrogen plus carbon dioxide and inert gases|air
A major part of carbon-dioxide emissions dissolved in water and reacted with metals such as calcium and magnesium during weathering of crustal rocks to form carbonates that were deposited as sediments|air
"Water-related sediments have been found that date from as early as 3.8 billion years ago.About 3.4 billion years ago, nitrogen formed the major part of the then stable ""second atmosphere"""|air
The influence of life has to be taken into account rather soon in the history of the atmosphere because hints of early life-forms appear as early as 3.5 billion years ago|air
"How Earth at that time maintained a climate warm enough for liquid water and life, if the early Sun put out 30% lower solar radiance than today, is a puzzle known as the ""faint young Sun paradox""."|air
The geological record however shows a continuous relatively warm surface during the complete early temperature record of Earth – with the exception of one cold glacial phase about 2.4 billion years ago|air
In the late Archean Eon an oxygen-containing atmosphere began to develop, apparently produced by photosynthesizing cyanobacteria (see Great Oxygenation Event), which have been found as stromatolite fossils from 2.7 billion years ago|air
The early basic carbon isotopy (isotope ratio proportions) strongly suggests conditions similar to the current, and that the fundamental features of the carbon cycle became established as early as 4 billion years ago.|air
Ancient sediments in the Gabon dating from between about 2.15 and 2.08 billion years ago provide a record of Earth's dynamic oxygenation evolution|air
These fluctuations in oxygenation were likely driven by the Lomagundi carbon isotope excursion.|air
The constant re-arrangement of continents by plate tectonics influences the long-term evolution of the atmosphere by transferring carbon dioxide to and from large continental carbonate stores|air
Free oxygen did not exist in the atmosphere until about 2.4 billion years ago during the Great Oxygenation Event and its appearance is indicated by the end of the banded iron formations.|air
Before this time, any oxygen produced by photosynthesis was consumed by the oxidation of reduced materials, notably iron|air
Free oxygen molecules did not start to accumulate in the atmosphere until the rate of production of oxygen began to exceed the availability of reducing materials that removed oxygen|air
This point signifies a shift from a reducing atmosphere to an oxidizing atmosphere|air
O2 showed major variations until reaching a steady state of more than 15% by the end of the Precambrian|air
The following time span from 541 million years ago to the present day is the Phanerozoic Eon, during the earliest period of which, the Cambrian, oxygen-requiring metazoan life forms began to appear.|air
The amount of oxygen in the atmosphere has fluctuated over the last 600 million years, reaching a peak of about 30% around 280 million years ago, significantly higher than today's 21%|air
Two main processes govern changes in the atmosphere|air
Plants using carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and releasing oxygen, and then plants using some oxygen at night by the process of photorespiration while the remaining oxygen is used to break down organic material|air
Breakdown of pyrite and volcanic eruptions release sulfur into the atmosphere, which reacts with oxygen and hence reduces its amount in the atmosphere|air
However, volcanic eruptions also release carbon dioxide, which plants can convert to oxygen|air
The cause of the variation of the amount of oxygen in the atmosphere is not known|air
Periods with much oxygen in the atmosphere are associated with the rapid development of animals because oxygen is the high-energy molecule needed to power all complex life-forms|air
Today's atmosphere contains 21% oxygen, which is great enough for this rapid development of animals.|air
Air pollution is the introduction into the atmosphere of chemicals, particulate matter or biological materials that cause harm or discomfort to organisms|air
Stratospheric ozone depletion is caused by air pollution, chiefly from chlorofluorocarbons and other ozone-depleting substances.|air
Since 1750, human activity has increased the concentrations various greenhouse gases, most importantly carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide|air
This increase has caused an observed rise in global temperatures|air
Global average surface temperatures were 1.1 °C higher in the 2011-2020 decade than they were in 1850.|air
On October 19, 2015, NASA started a website containing daily images of the full sunlit side of Earth at https://epic.gsfc.nasa.gov/|air
The images are taken from the Deep Space Climate Observatory (DSCOVR) and show Earth as it rotates during a day.|air

Zuko becomes conflicted and consults with the imprisoned Ozai, who advises Zuko that whatever decision he makes is inherently the correct choice because he exercises the power of the Fire Lord|zuko
Zuko decides to break from the Harmony Restoration Movement|zuko
The Earth King responds with a military force of his own and Zuko is forced to lead troops to Yu Dao to protect the Fire Nation civilians|zuko
In the battle, Aang and Zuko clash|zuko
However, Katara convinces the Earth King that the colonies are neither Fire Nation nor the Earth Kingdom, but rather a multicultural people|zuko
Peace is restored, and Zuko realizes that forcing Aang to make the promise was a way of distancing himself from his responsibilities as Fire Lord|zuko
He releases Aang from the promise, and the two reestablish their friendship and trust.|zuko
In various flashbacks in The Search, it is revealed that Zuko's mother, Ursa, was previously engaged to a man named Ikem in her hometown of Hira'a, but had to leave him after being pressured into marrying Fire Lord Ozai|zuko
Even after Zuko's birth, Ursa continued to write letters to Ikem, but Ozai intercepted the letters|zuko
Ursa, suspecting the interception, writes a letter claiming Zuko is Ikem's son rather than Ozai's|zuko
Ozai confronts her, and although he believes Zuko is truly his son, he retaliates by claiming to have ordered Ikem to be killed and stating he will treat Zuko as if he were actually Ikem's son.|zuko
A later flashback reveals that Ursa was responsible for creating an untraceable poison used by Ozai to kill Fire Lord Azulon in order to protect Zuko from Azulon|zuko
Ozai, fearing that Ursa would one day use the same poison against him, banishes Ursa from the palace the same night.|zuko

Azula manipulates these doubts to weaken Zuko's resolve to be Fire Lord.|zuko
Zuko and Azula discover that Ursa is alive and married to Ikem, having had her memories erased and appearance changed by a spirit to relieve her of the pain of losing her children|zuko
Zuko is satisfied to know that Ursa is happy and is prepared to leave Ursa in peace, but with Ikem's encouragement, reveals to her that he is her forgotten son|zuko
Zuko also says that he is Ikem's son, but Ikem says that this is not possible, implying that he and Ursa never had intercourse before her marriage to Ozai|zuko
Azula attacks Ursa and Zuko and tries to persuade Zuko to give up the throne|zuko

Zuko makes a final non-speaking appearance in Book Four|zuko
Balance, attending the coronation of Prince Wu along with Izumi.|zuko
The Blue Spirit design was inspired from a Dragon King Nuo mask from Chinese drama|zuko
His mask was made blue, because the creators thought that a red mask would give away the Blue Spirit's secret identity to the audience too easily.|zuko
Zuko lives in a fantasy world where the human population consists of four nations|zuko
the Earth Kingdom, the Water Tribes, the Air Nomads, and the Fire Nation|zuko
Some individuals can telekinetically manipulate one of the four classical elements|zuko
"water, earth, fire, or air; the art of controlling and manipulating an element is called ""bending."" The Avatar is the only individual who can bend all four elements"|zuko
100 years before the beginning of the narrative, Fire Lord Sozin, then the ruler of the Fire Nation, carried out a genocide of the Air Nomads as part of his plan to conquer the world for the Fire Nation.|zuko
A few years before the events of the series, Zuko voiced opposition to a general's suggestion that inexperienced Fire Nation soldiers be used as bait in a battle against the Earth Kingdom|zuko
Fire Lord Ozai, Zuko's father, ordered Zuko to submit to an Agni Kai, a ritual duel fought with firebending, to teach him respect|zuko
Zuko accepted the challenge believing that he would fight the general who proposed the plan, but instead he faced Ozai|zuko
When Zuko refused to fight his father, the Fire Lord mutilated his face, scarring him over his left eye, and sent him into exile|zuko
Zuko is told by Ozai that his honor and position would be restored only if he captured the Avatar, who at the time had not been seen for an entire century|zuko
Zuko's uncle, the decorated general Iroh, joined him as a companion and tutor.|zuko
Despite his youth, Zuko has demonstrated great agility and strength|zuko
His chief education in this is derived from his uncle Iroh; flashbacks reveal that Zuko's skills were subpar as a preteen, but that they improved dramatically under Iroh's tutelage|zuko
He is twice shown to be a match in combat to his sister Azula, although he lacks the emotional discipline to generate lightning|zuko
He is depicted throughout the series as both powerful and skillful in both martial and aesthetic applications of firebending.|zuko
"Zuko is skilled in ""Dao duel-wielding,"" as in the episode ""The Blue Spirit"" wherein he withstands a large number of adversaries"|zuko
"In ""Avatar"|zuko
"The Lost Adventures,"" it was revealed that he studied under Master Piandao, his uncle's colleague and Sokka's master sword fighting instructor"|zuko
Zuko has also demonstrated an ability in stealth and unarmed combat, as when able to infiltrate a Fire Nation fortress, the Northern Water Tribe's city, and the Dai Li's base in the Earth Kingdom without detection|zuko
"His proficiency at stealth was also utilized during the episode ""The Southern Raiders"" in which he and Katara stalked and cornered the former commander of the eponymous Raiders in his home village without revealing themselves"|zuko
Avatar Extras revealed he has abnormal hearing and that he is also naturally gifted at playing the Tsungi horn (though he is never heard playing).|zuko
Zuko is highly skilled in Firebending which utilizes Chinese martial arts techniques of Changquan, Shaolinquan, Lóng Xíng Mó Qiáo and Xing Yi Quan|zuko
The series' creators consulted a professional martial artist in the design of the show's fighting style|zuko
"Firebending represents the element of power, and is categorized as the most aggressive of the ""four bending arts."" Firebender discipline stresses self-restraint and breath control as a means of directing and containing the fire manifested"|zuko
Poor breath control means dangerously poor control of any fire generated|zuko
For this reason, breathing exercises are one of the most critical first steps for beginning firebenders.|zuko
Water is cool and soothing, Earth is steady and stable|zuko
But Fire..|zuko
Fire is alive|zuko
Has the potential to create or destroy|zuko
It breathes, it grows|zuko
Without the Bender, a rock will not throw itself|zuko
But Fire will spread and destroy everything in its path if one does not have the will to control it!|zuko
Fire can be used as a force of destruction, but is associated with creating and respecting life, as unlike the our elements, it is the only one that has a life of its own|zuko
The art of firebending is to control facilitate and understand that life|zuko
"Firebending involves ""external styles"" that prioritize one's legwork (as opposed to the arms) and emphasizes ""kicking over hand fighting""; the highly technical kicking strikes are meant to ""extend as far as possible"" without compromising balance"|zuko
This is intended to sacrifice defense for optimized preemptive strikes and attrition warfare|zuko
"Zuko's interpretation of firebending uses long, aggressive techniques that explode and drive through the opponent; quick, successive attacks that utilize momentary bursts of extreme ""explosive"" power; with fundamentally strong movements' and the usage of powerful, quick manoeuvres"|zuko
"This is depicted in the ""Agni Kai"" or fire-duels that Zuko competes in."|zuko
"A century of warfare has corrupted the Fire Nation's rich culture, and with it, their firebending-styles were erased from history, being ""regressed"" into militarized format based on hatred and raw aggression; Zuko and Aang rediscovered firebending in its purest and most harmonious form, Dancing Dragon Style, from the last surviving dragons"|zuko
Dragon Style is the bending art first practiced by the Sun Warriors, the earliest incarnation of the modern Fire Nation; for the Sun Warriors, fire is life, energy, and creativity, rather than destruction and hate|zuko
And by extension a true firebending master should be able to appreciate the life in all things.|zuko
Zuko's character has received overwhemingly positive reception from critics and audiences alike|zuko
He is considered by several critics to have one of the best redemption arcs in television|zuko
"Tory Ireland Mell of IGN thought it was ""painful"" to watch Zuko try to win the trust of Team Avatar as he was ""completely vulnerable, and no one cared."" Mell found his reunion with Iroh to be ""heartwarming."" Zuko was listed by Zach Blumenfeld from Paste as the best character from the Avatar universe, with Blumenfeld noting his complex transformation and redemption story over the course of the series"|zuko
Dante Basco received praise for his portrayal of the character.|zuko
Appa (Chinese|Appa_(character)
阿柏; pinyin|Appa_(character)
Ā Bǎi) is a fictional character on the Nickelodeon animated television series Avatar|Appa_(character)
The Last Airbender and in the film The Last Airbender|Appa_(character)
In the series, Appa is the only known living sky flat-tailed  flying bison, a species of animals that can fly naturally, and is the animal spirit guide of the protagonist, Aang|Appa_(character)
Dee Bradley Baker voices Appa, along with all the other animals, in both the TV series and the film.|Appa_(character)
The show's creators Michael Dante DiMartino and Bryan Konietzko have described Appa's appearance as a cross between a buffalo and a manatee, although its body plan does resemble that of a water bear|Appa_(character)
According to an interview with the artists involved with creating the show, Appa's design was based on that of Catbus from the movie My Neighbor Totoro, as they found it difficult to create a six-legged mammal.|Appa_(character)
In the Avatar franchise, Appa is the last known living sky bison, which are large mammal-like creatures that fly through airbending and steer through air currents with their broad tails|Appa_(character)
The bison are covered in thick white fur with a large brown arrow marking that is remarked to be extremely itchy|Appa_(character)
In the show, the markings on the flying bison's backs are what inspired the tattoos which symbolize an Air Nomad's mastery of Airbending|Appa_(character)
Their fur is shed at the end of winter|Appa_(character)
The Air Nomads summon the sky bison to their side through the use of whistles that only the animals can hear|Appa_(character)
"Aang and friends use the words ""yip yip"" to get Appa to take off into the air."|Appa_(character)
Throughout the series, Appa has demonstrated high intelligence and often appears to understand a portion of human speech, whereas Momo, the winged lemur, struggles to understand|Appa_(character)
Although placid, Appa has shown himself capable of fighting when necessary.|Appa_(character)
Other aspects of Appa's character include his fear of fire and his trusting of those who have been kind to him|Appa_(character)
He can become quite temperamental towards anyone who he thinks is a threat to himself or his friends, especially Aang|Appa_(character)
Conversely, he has demonstrated an unrestrained affection towards those that he likes|Appa_(character)
"Appa also has a fear of going underground or in small tunnels, evidenced by his claustrophobic panic in the episode ""The Cave of Two Lovers""."|Appa_(character)
He has a special friendship with Momo the lemur, with whom he is often in company|Appa_(character)
Appa also shows a special preference towards Zuko, who saved him from his imprisonment beneath Lake Laogai.|Appa_(character)
Appa is featured prominently throughout the franchise, not only in the Avatar|Appa_(character)
The Last Airbender TV series, but also in the film The Last Airbender, various video games, and comic books|Appa_(character)
Dee Bradley Baker voices Appa in both the TV series and the film.|Appa_(character)
Appa is in almost every episode of the animated series, having appeared in 58 of the 61 episodes of the three seasons|Appa_(character)
"Much of the back-story about the character comes from the episode Appa's Lost Days, ""in which the most under-explored member of the team gets his very own episode.""The first meeting between Aang and Appa is seen during a flashback sequence in Appa's Lost Days."|Appa_(character)
It is tradition with Air Nomads that each young Airbender is given a sky bison calf once they come of age to be the Airbender's lifelong animal companion|Appa_(character)
In a flashback on Appa's Lost Days, Appa's herd flies down to an Air Nomad Temple where Aang and other young Airbenders are waiting|Appa_(character)
"Aang brings Appa an apple as a sign of friendship, which Appa accepts, sealing their bond as well as giving Appa his name, after the word ""apple"""|Appa_(character)
Almost immediately, the two became friends and would remain close, Appa being the one thing aside from his staff and robes from Aang's home that Aang took with him when he fled the Southern Air Temple.Appa remained in suspended animation along with Aang for 100 years until their discovery by Katara and Sokka.|Appa_(character)
Since then, Appa has been the group's main form of transportation in their quest, as well as occasionally assisting in battle|Appa_(character)
"Appa was a consistent part of the group throughout the series until his capture by the Sandbenders in ""The Library"".Appa became lost for a short time when the group was traveling in the Earth Kingdom"|Appa_(character)
He was kidnapped by Sandbenders in the middle of the vast Si Wong desert, while Aang, Katara, Sokka, and their winged lemur Momo were trapped in a vast underground library|Appa_(character)
It is later revealed that he was eventually sold to a Fire Nation circus where an animal tamer attempted to make him part of the show.|Appa_(character)
Being healed of his personal turmoil and directed to Aang by the sadhu, Appa flew to Ba Sing Se, where he was captured by Long Feng.Appa was kept in a secret location at Lake Laogai until his rescue by Zuko, who was initially planning on utilizing him to capture the Avatar|Appa_(character)
Appa eventually returns to the main group in the last scenes of Lake Laogai.Appa still accompanies Aang and his group even after they enter the Fire Nation|Appa_(character)
However, in order to make sure that he does not give away Aang's identity when flying, Aang covers Appa with clouds as a disguise while in flight.At the Western Air Temple, he was among the first members of the group to accept Zuko as Aang's firebending teacher, as he is still grateful for Zuko freeing him in Ba Sing Se|Appa_(character)
He flew Aang and Zuko to the Sun Warrior Temple in order to learn the origin of firebending.|Appa_(character)
He also flew Zuko and Katara to the Southern Raiders ship, so Katara could confront the murderer of her mother.After the search for Aang in the finale failed, the group was forced to divide their efforts to prevent the Fire Nation from wiping out the Earth Kingdom|Appa_(character)
Appa flew Zuko and Katara to the Fire Nation capital where they fought and defeated Azula before she could assume leadership of the throne|Appa_(character)
Afterward, Appa is last seen outside of Iroh's tea shop in Ba Sing Se, listening to Iroh play a horn.|Appa_(character)
Appa appears in the 2010 live-action film The Last Airbender with roar effects provided by Dee Bradley Baker|Appa_(character)
Appa's role in the film has been noted to be significantly less prominent than in the animated series.The sky bison was rendered entirely in computer graphics for the film by Industrial Light & Magic (ILM), with Pablo Helman as visual-effects supervisor|Appa_(character)
Regarding the challenges of adapting the cartoon Appa into a realistic-looking CGI beast, Helman said:|Appa_(character)
"""He has six legs, and that's a big challenge for us, because how do you take it into reality"|Appa_(character)
There is no reference for a creature with six legs|Appa_(character)
Nature doesn't create those things|Appa_(character)
It's very difficult to get six legs to do the right thing|Appa_(character)
We looked at how elephants walked, which helped|Appa_(character)
"We did some tests and figured out Appa would pretty much move like an elephant."""|Appa_(character)
The first video game Appa appeared in is the 2006 Avatar|Appa_(character)
The Last Airbender|Appa_(character)
Appa also appears in Avatar|Appa_(character)
The Last Airbender - The Burning Earth and in Avatar|Appa_(character)
The Last Airbender - Into the Inferno|Appa_(character)
In the Avatar|Appa_(character)
"The Last Airbender Plug It In & Play TV Game, Appa takes center stage in ""Appa Air Attack"" in which Appa destroys Fire Nation airships using his airbending abilities."|Appa_(character)
Appa has been featured in varying pieces of merchandise, including toys and plush dolls|Appa_(character)
The sky bison has also been featured as a McDonald's Happy Meal toy—with Appa as a launcher that shoots out Momo, the flying lemur.|Appa_(character)
KidsTelly.com's Dan G|Appa_(character)
"Hughes noted that ""the flying six legged bison has a lovingly sketched personality,"" further commenting how every character (including Appa) changes and grows throughout the series"|Appa_(character)
"Kevin Fitzpatrick of UGO Entertainment praised Appa's ""love and courage throughout the series"" citing how ""our cuddly 8-foot tall buddy [is] willing to face any danger, and overcome any hardship to return to his master.""Leading up to the opening of The Last Airbender, reporter Kofi Outlaw of Screen Rant remarked that Appa ""is a fan-favorite of the series."" Similarly, Edward Douglas noted in Superhero Hype"|Appa_(character)
"that ""Two of the characters from the cartoon fans are most anxious to see brought to life aren't even human"|Appa_(character)
"They are Appa, Aang's six-legged flying bison, and Momo, his flying pet lemur."" The film trailer shown during the Super Bowl led UGO Entertainment critic Jordan Hoffman to ask, ""Where's Appa?"" as the sole complaint, noting the character's lack of prominence in the preview"|Appa_(character)
"Correspondingly, MTV's Rick Marshall provided instructions online on ""how to find the elusive Appa"" for the character's brief appearance in the background of a trailer scene.As with the rest of the film, Appa's appearance in The Last Airbender was met with largely negative reviews"|Appa_(character)
"Geekosystem's Susana Polo found the CGI version of Appa ""really quite creepy,"" noting ""that prey animals (like bison) have eyes on the sides of their heads, and so moving them to the front without changing rest of the facial structure tips us right into the Uncanny Valley."" With regards to the film's scripting, io9 reviewer Meredith Woerner wrote, ""The saddest cut by far was watching Appa and Momo's personalities disappear.""In season 4 of the television series Star Wars"|Appa_(character)

Avatar Aang (Chinese|aang
安昂; pinyin|aang
Ān Áng) is a title character and the protagonist of Nickelodeon's animated television series Avatar|aang
The Last Airbender (created by Michael Dante DiMartino and Bryan Konietzko), voiced by Zach Tyler Eisen|aang
Aang is the last surviving Airbender, a monk of the Air Nomads' Southern Air Temple.|aang
"He is an incarnation of the ""Avatar"", the spirit of light and peace manifested in human form"|aang
As the Avatar, Aang controls all four elements (water, earth, fire, and air) and is tasked with bringing balance and keeping the Four Nations at peace|aang
At 112 years old (physically 12), Aang is the series' reluctant hero, spending a century in suspended animation in an iceberg before being discovered and joining new friends Katara and Sokka on a quest to master the elements and save their world from the imperialist Fire Nation.|aang
Aang's character has appeared in other media, such as trading cards, video games, T-shirts, and web comics|aang
Aang has also been portrayed by Noah Ringer in the live-action film The Last Airbender (2010), and voiced by D.B|aang
Sweeney in the sequel series The Legend of Korra|aang
Gordon Cormier will portray Aang in the upcoming Netflix live-action adaptation of the same name.|aang
Avatar|aang
The Last Airbender|aang
Upon death, Avatar Roku was reincarnated and Aang was born, and later raised by Monk Gyatso, a senior monk at the Southern Air Temple and friend of the late Avatar Roku|aang
Even prior to learning he was the Avatar, Aang distinguished himself by becoming one of the youngest Airbending Masters in history by inventing a new technique|aang
As a result of Fire Lord Sozin's increasingly hostile attitude towards the other nations, the senior monks decided to reveal Aang's nature as the Avatar four years before the traditional age (Avatars are usually told of their status once they turn 16) and relocate him to one of the other Air Temples|aang
Learning that he was to be taken from Gyatso caused Aang to flee the monastery on his flying bison, Appa, before being caught by a storm; the life-or-death conditions triggered the Avatar State, encasing the young Avatar and his bison in an air-pocket among icebergs, where he remained suspended for a century|aang
Although Monk Gyatso had snuck into Aang's bedroom late at night to tell Aang that he won't be relocated to the Eastern Air Temple, it had already been too late.|aang
Book One|aang
Water|aang
After one hundred years of suspended animation in an iceberg, twelve-year-old Aang was freed when found by Katara and Sokka, yet unaware of the events that occurred during his rest|aang
His reawakening catches the attention of Zuko, the banished prince of the Fire Nation, and Aang is forced to leave, with Katara and Sokka accompanying him after they learn that he is the Avatar|aang
Aang and his new friends visit the Southern Air Temple, where they meet a winged lemur whom Aang later names Momo|aang
It is there that Aang learns that the Fire Nation wiped out his people, including Gyatso which causes Aang to summon his avatar spirit and the other 3 nations find out the avatar is back|aang
After a series of misadventures, Aang meets his previous incarnation, Roku, who informs him that he must master all four bending arts and end the war before the coming of Sozin's Comet at the end of summer|aang
Upon arriving to the Northern Water Tribe, after a few conflicts, Aang became an apprentice of Waterbending Master Pakku alongside Katara|aang
After helping the Water Tribe drive off a Fire Nation invasion headed by Admiral Zhao, with Katara as his teacher, Aang and his group journey to the Earth Kingdom to find an Earthbending teacher|aang
Meanwhile, Fire Lord Ozai, angered that Iroh betrayed the Fire Nation, sends his daughter, Princess Azula, to hunt down Zuko and Iroh.|aang
Book Two|aang
Earth|aang
In the second season, Aang learns Earthbending from Toph Beifong  after he has a vision of the blind Earthbender in a swamp telling him to find her|aang
On their journey, they are chased by Fire Princess Azula and her friends Mai and Ty Lee|aang
The group learns about the Day of Black Sun in a secret underground library, and they attempt to reveal the information to the Earth King at Ba Sing Se|aang
However, their flying bison, Appa, is captured by Sandbenders|aang
Aang grows upset and angry and confronts the Sandbenders, learning that Appa has been sold|aang
After stopping a Fire Nation drill threatening the safety of Ba Sing Se, they look for Appa only to find themselves dealing with the Dai Li before exposing their leader's deception|aang
The group reunites with Jet helping them find Appa at Dai Li headquarters|aang
They expose the Hundred Year War to the Earth King, who promises to help them invade the Fire Nation|aang
Soon after, Aang meets a guru who attempts to teach Aang to open his seven chakras in order to control the defensive 'Avatar State'; but when Aang perceives Katara in danger, he leaves before the seventh chakra is opened, and thus loses his progress until the seventh is opened|aang
Though Aang manages to unlock the Seventh Chakra, he is fatally electrocuted by Azula|aang
He is later brought back to life by Katara, using the spirit water given to her by the Northern Water Tribe at the start of the second season.|aang
Book Three|aang
Fire|aang
In the beginning of third and final season, after he woke after being knocked out by Azula, Aang grew some hair|aang
After that, Aang is unable to use the Avatar State for quite a while|aang
Although reluctant with the plan at first, Aang accepts to have everyone think he had died and his remaining allies attack the Fire Nation's capital, but are thwarted by Azula|aang
However, Zuko has a change of heart, rebels against his father, and offers to teach Aang Firebending|aang
Aang and Zuko also improve their Firebending powers with the help of their world's last two dragons|aang
(In this part of the show, he is 13) During the finale, finding himself on a strange island, Aang is reluctant to actually kill Fire Lord Ozai, despite his four previous past lives (Roku, Kyoshi, Kuruk, and Yangchen) convincing him it is the only way|aang
But upon learning that he was actually on the back of a Lion Turtle, one of four that made the first benders by manipulating humans' chi, Aang receives the Lion Turtle’s Energybending|aang
During the final battle, Aang's scar is pressed against a jutting rock, opening his chakras and allowing him to enter the Avatar State|aang
Aang wins the battle, but before he delivers the final blow, he stops himself|aang
Instead, Aang removes Ozai's bending ability, rendering him harmless and ending the Hundred Year War|aang
Later, in the Fire Nation capital, Aang is seen beside Zuko, the new Fire Lord|aang
The series ends with Aang and his friends relaxing at Iroh's tea shop at Ba Sing Se, where Aang and Katara share a kiss.|aang
"After beginning the Harmony Restoration Movement, an event that was meant to remove Fire Nation remnants from the Earth Kingdom, Aang agrees to end Zuko's life should he go down a path similar to his father, after the latter requests it, being stopped by Katara from entering the Avatar State as he began a later encounter with Zuko and then tries to mediate protestors and the Yu Dao resistance, afterward assembling members of a fan club and forming the ""Air Acolytes"", a group that he intends to teach the ways of the Air Nomads"|aang
Aang then participated in a search for Zuko's mother Ursa, successfully finding her and entering the Spirit World to assist in locating the Mother of Faces, convincing her to grant Rafa a new face|aang
After a period of entertainment, Aang is contacted by his former life Yangchen, who tried contacting him about Old Iron's return|aang
Aang also has a fight with the Rough Rhinos when they try to oust him from the Eastern Fire Refinery|aang
Aang then aids in preventing Azula, disguised as the Kemurikage, from stealing any more children.|aang
Being frozen in an iceberg for 100 years while in the Avatar State drained much of Aang's life energy|aang
While he did not feel the effects for many years, after he entered middle age in his 50s, the strain of this exertion increasingly weighed upon his body|aang
Ultimately, it resulted in Aang dying at the relatively young biological age of 66 since he was in the ice for 100 years, in 153 AG|aang
Aang was survived by his wife, Katara, and his three children, but he did not live to see his grandchildren, all of whom would become powerful airbenders|aang
Prior to his death, Aang tasked the Order of the White Lotus with finding and guiding the new Avatar after him|aang
When Aang died, the Avatar spirit reincarnated into Korra of the Southern Water Tribe|aang
Aang intended for the Order to simply guide and guard Korra, but several mishaps in the aftermath of Aang's death (including a kidnapping attempt by the anarchist Zaheer) and the still-fragile state of relations between the now-Five Nations resulted in Katara and Tenzin sequestering Korra in a compound at the South Pole, bringing teachers to her instead of allowing her to seek out her own.|aang
Book One|aang
Air|aang
In the sequel series' first season, Avatar Aang's spirit occasionally serves as the spiritual advisor to seventeen-year-old Korra (much like the previous Avatar incarnation, Roku, did for Aang)|aang
Korra struggles with the spiritual aspects of bending and being the avatar, so initially Aang is only able to give Korra glimpses of his memory concerning Yakone in relation to her confrontations with his two sons, Amon and Tarrlok, the products of Yakone's Bloodbending vendetta on the Avatar|aang
It is only after she loses her ability to bend that Korra allows herself to listen to her past lives, at which point Aang is able to manifest more directly to her and helps to restore her powers by triggering the Avatar State and teaching her to Energybend.|aang
Book Two|aang
Spirits|aang
The sequel series' second season reveals that Avatar Aang apparently treated Tenzin as his favorite child, due to his son's Airbender status; Kya and Bumi mentioned to Tenzin that Aang always took Tenzin on vacations with him, but never them|aang
Aang's Air Acolytes also were unaware that Aang had two other children besides Tenzin|aang
Tenzin himself insists that Aang loved all his children equally, but that Aang took more precedence in raising him since Tenzin would have to take care of future generations of airbenders|aang
Aang himself later appears, along with Roku, Kyoshi and Kuruk, before Korra in a vision and encourages her to learn the origins of Wan (the first Avatar) and Raava|aang
Aang, or possibly a vision of him, later appears in the Spirit World, encouraging Tenzin to move past the enormous legacy of being Aang's son and find his own path|aang
Korra's connection to Aang and the other preceding Avatars is severed when Vaatu extracts and subsequently kills Raava, the divine Avatar Spirit entity within her|aang
Even though Raava is reborn and fused again with Korra, she discovers, to her dismay, that her spiritual connection to Aang and all past Avatars is gone forever.|aang
Book Three|aang
Change|aang
When Zaheer gave an ultimatum|aang
Surrender to him or lose the new airbenders, Korra meditated into the spirit realm, she expressed her wish to call upon Aang's spirit and ask his advice in saving the new Air Nomads|aang
Iroh's spirit assured her that, even though Aang was no longer able to guide her, she could ask one of Aang's closest friends|aang
Lord Zuko.|aang
Aang's character appeared in the Avatar|aang
The Last Airbender Trading Card Game on a multitude of cards|aang
He appeared in the Avatar|aang
The Last Airbender video game as one of the four playable characters|aang
Two sequels were made|aang
Avatar|aang
The Last Airbender – The Burning Earth, followed by Avatar|aang
The Last Airbender – Into the Inferno|aang
Aang appears as a playable racer in Nickelodeon Kart Racers 2|aang
Grand Prix.|aang
Aang also appeared in Escape from the Spirit World, an online video game that can be found on Nickelodeon's official website|aang
The game includes certain plot changes that are not shown in the show|aang
The show's directors, Michael DiMartino and Bryan Konietzko, claim the events are canon|aang
Aang is also a playable character in the Nickelodeon game Super Brawl Universe|aang
There is also a location in the game set in the Air Temple|aang
Tokyopop has published a films comic (sometimes referred to as cine-manga), in which Aang, being the main character of the show, appears repeatedly.In 2010, director M|aang
Night Shyamalan cast 12-year-old Tae Kwon Do practitioner Noah Ringer as Aang in the film adaptation of the series, The Last Airbender|aang
His name in the film is pronounced [ɑŋ] instead of [eəŋ]|aang
The casting of a presumed white actor in the role of Aang (as well as a primarily Caucasian cast) in the Asian-influenced Avatar universe triggered negative reactions from some fans, marked by accusations of racism, a letter-writing campaign, and a protest outside of a Philadelphia casting call for movie extras|aang
A counter-movement was spawned in response by other fans who believed the casting was appropriate|aang
The casting decisions were also negatively received by several critics, who stated that the original casting call expressed a preference for Caucasian actors over others|aang
Noah Ringer later identified himself to Entertainment Weekly as an American Indian.|aang
Aang's character was developed from a drawing by Bryan Konietzko, depicting a bald man with an arrowlike design on his head, which the artist developed into a picture of a child with a flying bison|aang
Meanwhile, Michael Dante DiMartino was interested in a documentary about explorers trapped in the South Pole, which he later combined with Konietzko's drawing.|aang
The plot they described corresponds with the first and second episodes of Avatar|aang
"The Last Airbender, where the ""water people"" (Katara and Sokka) rescue the ""air guy"" (Aang) while ""trapped in a snowy wasteland"" (the Southern Water Tribe) with ""some fire people [that] are pressing down on them"" (Fire Nation Troops and Zuko)"|aang
The creators of the show intended Aang to be trapped in an iceberg for one hundred years, later to wake inside a futuristic world, wherein he would have a robot named Momo and a dozen bisons|aang
The creators lost interest in this theme, and changed it to one hundred years of suspended animation|aang
"The robotic Momo became a flying lemur, and the herd of bison was reduced to one.In the episode ""Tales of Ba Sing Se"", Aang's name was written as 安昂 (ān áng) in Chinese."|aang
"According to the show's creators, ""Buddhism and Taoism have been huge inspirations behind the idea for Avatar."" As shown in ""The King of Omashu"" and ""The Headband"", a notable aspect of Aang's character is his vegetarian diet, which is consistent with Buddhism, Hinduism, and Taoism"|aang
In the Brahmajala Sutra, a Buddhist code of ethics, vegetarianism is encouraged|aang
Furthermore, the writers gave Aang a consistent reluctance to fight and an aversion to killing|aang
"In ""The Spirit World (Winter Solstice, Part 1)"", Aang encounters an angry spirit destroying a village and kidnapping villagers; but instead of fighting the spirit, Aang negotiates"|aang
He is also depicted showing ethical reluctance in killing the Phoenix King, and eventually strips Ozai of his bending instead of murdering him.|aang
As the Avatar, Aang is capable of bending all four elements (air, water, earth and fire)|aang
"The series' creators consulted a professional martial artist in the design of the show's fighting style; each of these styles' philosophies and set movements corresponds to a specific ""bending arts"".The creators made bending a natural extension of consistent limitations and rules of the world"|aang
Everything in Avatar's world, whether it be clothing, culture or infrastructure, is influenced by bending|aang
The City of Omashu uses a complex system of gravity and earthbending to transport supplies|aang
The Water Tribes were a naval superpower|aang
their buildings are made of ice and used waterbending as mechanisms for their walls and gates|aang
Airbenders built temples atop high mountains and cliffs that could only be easily reached by Airbending and they have a hermetic ideology to reflect this isolation|aang
The Fire Nation were the first to industrialize due to their ability to generate power and master metallurgy with their bending of fire and lightning.|aang
At the start of the series, Aang is initially only proficient in air, having been able to bend it with ease since he was a young child|aang
Through the teaching of Katara and Zuko, he gradually learns waterbending and firebending; but struggles with Toph's teachings of earthbending due to its rigid nature conflicting with his desire for freedom|aang
Aang utilizes all elements equally, but heavily favors airbending for crowd control and non-lethal purposes, in accordance with his pacifism principles.|aang
Airbending|aang
"The bending art Aang primarily uses in the entire franchise, is a Southern Temple Style based on an ""internal"" Chinese martial art called Baguazhang"|aang
Aang is the only person in living memory to have mastered this form of airbending, and would later pass down this knowledge to his son, Tenzin, who with the aid of Korra, would prove instrumental in the reconstruction and preservation of Air Nomad oral and intangible cultural heritage|aang
"Due to the genocide of his people, all other ""styles of airbending arts"" have been forever lost to history"|aang
This fighting style focuses on circular movements, and does not have many finishing moves; traits meant to represent the unpredictability of air and the peaceful character of Airbenders|aang
"Airbending represents the element of freedom, and is categorized as the most elusive of the ""four bending arts"""|aang
Airbending utilizes negative jing, which involves retreating and dodging attacks|aang
"Airbending involves ""smooth coiling and uncoiling actions""; dynamic footwork, throws, and open-handed techniques; and swift, evasive maneuvers designed to evoke the ""intangibility and explosive power of wind"""|aang
These techniques are intended to increase the difficulty for opponents to attack directly or land a lethal blow—allowing airbenders to defend themselves while also protecting their attacker from injury—a pacifist-philosophy that is prevalent among the Air Nomad people|aang
"Airbending lacks ""finishing moves"" or effective methods for permanently disabling foes, a weakness frequently exploited by opponents."|aang
Waterbending|aang
"Waterbending is the bending art Katara, later Pakku, teaches Aang in the series, which is based on Chinese martial arts techniques of ""internal style"" T'ai chi ch'uan and Jeet Kune Do"|aang
When Aang traveled north, he learned Northern Tribe Yin-style|aang
"During the Legend of Korra, Katara is the only Master of ""Southern Tribe Yang-style"", forced to reconstruct the style from surviving manuscripts; all other masters were killed, their collective knowledge confiscated or destroyed by the Fire Nation"|aang
"Waterbending represents the element of change—a shapeshifter constantly changing forms—and is categorized as the most adaptive or pliable of the ""four bending arts"""|aang
"Waterbending emphasizes ""softness and breathing"" over ""hard aggression""; fluid and graceful, acting in concert with the environment; creating opportunities where none exist; this ""flow of energy"" allows their defensive maneuvers to translate into focus on control and counter-offenses, turning their opponents' momentum against them"|aang
Despite these advantages, Waterbending is almost entirely dependent on inertia; it is essential for practitioners to not be rigid, but to be fluid and able to adapt to any situation.|aang
Earthbending|aang
Earthbending is the martial art Toph teaches Aang in the series, which is based on Chinese martial arts techniques of Hóng Quán and Chu Gar Nán Pài Tángláng|aang
Earthbending represents the element of substance|aang
Toph's earthbending style is Chu Gar Praying Mantis, as opposed to the more common Hung Gar, taught to her by the original earthbenders, badgermoles|aang
"Earthbending is categorized as the most diverse and enduring of the ""four bending arts"""|aang
Earthbending is the geokinetic ability to manipulate earth, rock, sand, lava, and metals in all their various forms|aang
Earthbending utilizes neutral jing, which involves waiting and listening for the right moment to act decisively|aang
"Earthbending involves enduring attacks until the right opportunity to counterattack reveals itself, emphasizes ""heavily rooted stances and strong blows that evoke the mass and power of earth"", and demands precise stepping footwork to maintain constant contact with the ground"|aang
Earthbending parallels Five Animals movements (such as the tiger's hard blows and the crane's affinity to landing gracefully)|aang
Earthbending is at its strongest when the feet or hand are in direct contact with the ground, enabling earthbenders to transfer their kinetic energies into their bending for fast and powerful moves|aang
This reliance on direct contact with the earth is a literal Achilles' heel; separating earthbenders from any contact with the earth renders them ineffective.|aang
Firebending|aang
Firebending is the martial art Zuko teaches Aang in the series, which is based on chinese martial arts techniques of Changquan, Shaolinquan, Lóng Xíng Mó Qiáo and Xing Yi Quan|aang
Firebending represents the element of power—desire and will paired with energy to achieve it, a philosophy reflected in firebending's unique capability for its users to generate their central element, rather than manipulating already present sources|aang
Firebenders use breath control to manipulate chi in their own bodies and convert the energy from breathing into fire once it exits the body|aang
"A century of warfare have corrupted the Fire Nation's rich culture, and with it, their firebending-styles ""regressed"" into militarized format based on hatred and raw aggression; Zuko and Aang sought to learn firebending in its purest and most harmonious form, and rediscovered Dancing Dragon Style from the last surviving dragons"|aang
Dragon Style is the bending art first practiced by the Sun Warriors, the earliest incarnation of the modern Fire Nation; for the Sun Warriors, fire is life, energy, and creativity, rather than destruction and hate|aang
"Firebending is categorized as the most determined and powerful of the ""four bending arts"""|aang
All Firebending styles emphasize initiative and speed, overwhelming their opponents with powerful jabs and kicks that hurl fire before building to an explosive finishing move, mirroring the vitality and explosive power of fire|aang
"This is often seen in the ""Agni Kai"" or fire-duels that Zuko competes in"|aang
A master firebender will confidently control fire, rather than allowing their energy to become unfocused rage|aang
A select few high-level firebenders can access highly destructive and lethal skills, such as lightning-bending and combustion-bending|aang
Firebending's offensive power comes with a trade-off|aang
a lack of blocks or evasive maneuvers, particularly when facing other elements.|aang
Energybending|aang
Aang learned about energybending from the last living lion turtle, as he did not wish to kill Ozai, and was given the ability to do so|aang
He is able to use energybending to connect with his inner spirit and gain cosmic energy from the universe|aang
In The Legend of Korra, Aang gave Avatar Korra, the current Avatar, the ability to energybend, which was used to restore people's bending abilities after Amon removed them using bloodbending.|aang
"As the Avatar, Aang is as a bridge between ""Material World"" and the ""Spirit World"", the plane of existence where the universe's disembodied spirits dwell"|aang
His spirituality training progressed swiftly, granting visions and access to the various memories from his past lives.|aang
As his predecessors, his most powerful ability is the Avatar State, in which he receives a massive boost in raw power from the cosmic energy, enabling him to easily overcome any opponent that tries to fight him head on|aang
In addition, this state allows him to access bending techniques he would not have learned during his own lifetime but throughout those of his past lives|aang
If he is killed in the Avatar State, then this would cause the Avatar to cease being reincarnated and end the Avatar Cycle.|aang
Aang was received exceptionally by critics and fans|aang
"Kendall Lyons stated, ""Aang seems to be the lighthearted kid that you can easily familiarize yourself with"", and that he ""seems to bring comfort in the most dangerous or hostile situations."" There are many similar descriptions about Aang as a childlike character who is ""reckless and excitable"""|aang
"Reviews point out that ""as the Avatar, Aang seems unstoppable, but as Aang, he is just another Airbender""; the review states later that the show continues to focus on a more realistic character instead of a perfect one by revealing many character flaws.In 2016, Screen Rant ranked Aang #15 on its ""30 Best Animated TV Characters Of All Time"" list.At the 2020 Tokyo Summer Olympics, Dutch windsurfer Kiran Badloe won the gold medal in Men's RS"|aang

Kǎ (卡) means to check, block, or card; Tǎ (塔) means pagoda; and Lā (拉) means to pull|katara_(Avatar:_The_Last_Airbender)
"The character 'Lā' appears in the first season's finale as the name of the Ocean Spirit, while the character 'Kǎ' also appears in Sokka's name.In the commentary of the unaired pilot episode, co creators Bryan Konietzko and Michael Dante DiMartino state that Katara's ""hair loopies"" were intended to hang downward, but were thought too hard to animate and looped backward instead."|katara_(Avatar:_The_Last_Airbender)
"Katara is described as ""smart, capable, caring; a heroine"", and as ""kind, brave, and passionate."" In many situations, Katara appears as a mother to the other protagonists"|katara_(Avatar:_The_Last_Airbender)
a role attributed to her tribe's losses to raids and the departure of many members to war, which required her (as well as her brother Sokka) to assume responsibilities beyond her age|katara_(Avatar:_The_Last_Airbender)
Katara tends to be kind and generous, but is often stubborn or confined by her morals; becomes angry if doubted, insulted, or betrayed; and carries resentment for years on end|katara_(Avatar:_The_Last_Airbender)

Balance|katara_(Avatar:_The_Last_Airbender)
Katara's abilities develop considerably throughout the series|katara_(Avatar:_The_Last_Airbender)
At the outset, she has little control over her waterbending, and often loses control in moments of frustration or anger|katara_(Avatar:_The_Last_Airbender)
"Thanks to diligent practice, an instruction scroll, and tutelage under a Master, her skill improves until she is bestowed with the status and title of ""Waterbending Yang-style Master"""|katara_(Avatar:_The_Last_Airbender)
She was chosen by Korra as her instructor in the Southern Tribe Yang-style martial arts, bending arts and the healing arts.|katara_(Avatar:_The_Last_Airbender)
"Katara is highly skilled in Waterbending which utilizes Chinese martial arts techniques of ""internal style"" T'ai chi ch'uan and Jeet Kune Do; Katara is the only surviving Master of ""Southern Tribe Yang-style"" after the 100 year genocide"|katara_(Avatar:_The_Last_Airbender)
The series' creators consulted a professional martial artist in the design of the show's fighting style|katara_(Avatar:_The_Last_Airbender)
"Waterbending represents the element of change – a shapeshifter constantly changing forms – and is categorized as the most adaptive or pliable of the ""four bending arts"""|katara_(Avatar:_The_Last_Airbender)
"Waterbending emphasizes ""softness and breathing"" over ""hard aggression""; fluid and graceful, acting in concert with the environment; creating opportunities where none exist; this ""flow of energy"" allows their defensive maneuvers to translate into focus on control and counter-offenses, turning their opponents' momentum against them"|katara_(Avatar:_The_Last_Airbender)
Despite these advantages, Waterbending is almost entirely dependent on inertia; it is essential for practitioners to not be rigid, but to be fluid and able to adapt to any situation.|katara_(Avatar:_The_Last_Airbender)
"""Solid, liquid, gas – Water is the element of change"|katara_(Avatar:_The_Last_Airbender)
Water is patient and waits|katara_(Avatar:_The_Last_Airbender)
Wears down the cliff tops, the mountains|katara_(Avatar:_The_Last_Airbender)
"There is nothing softer and weaker than water, and yet there is nothing better for attacking hard and strong things."""|katara_(Avatar:_The_Last_Airbender)
Katara has demonstrated to be a formidable opponent to her enemies, able to fight on equal terms with Azula and Long Feng; she eventually outmatched the Fire Nation princess to demonstrate the extent of her skill|katara_(Avatar:_The_Last_Airbender)
Katara can use water to cut through objects; summon lashing waves and whips of varying sizes; cover herself with a sheath of water; surf on a length of ice; run and stand on the surface of water; melt and control existing ice; form ice into various shapes; freeze water and objects surrounded by water with little effort; create walls of mist and steam; transform steam into ice; evaporate large amounts of water; or derive a weapon from any moisture including her own perspiration|katara_(Avatar:_The_Last_Airbender)
She can control huge amounts of water at a time, forming huge waves and bubbles of water|katara_(Avatar:_The_Last_Airbender)
On one instance, Katara knocked down the entire Dai Li, Zuko, and Azula while riding atop a giant wave|katara_(Avatar:_The_Last_Airbender)
As with all Waterbenders, Katara's powers increase under the influence of a full moon.|katara_(Avatar:_The_Last_Airbender)
"Katara demonstrates the ability to levitate and control water-based liquids, as well as pure water, in the episode ""The Southern Raiders"", wherein Katara bends ink onto a map"|katara_(Avatar:_The_Last_Airbender)
She is also seen bending soup (which allows her to cook meals), and bends perfume while battling a smell-dependent monster|katara_(Avatar:_The_Last_Airbender)
"In the episode ""The Painted Lady,"" she uses her bending to create a thick fog"|katara_(Avatar:_The_Last_Airbender)
Katara also demonstrates the ability to bend sweat and the ability to manipulate mud with Toph, who manipulates the dirt while Katara controls the water.|katara_(Avatar:_The_Last_Airbender)
Katara is one of the few waterbenders born with the sub-ability of healing injuries or wounds, first demonstrated after she is burned by Aang's first attempt at firebending|katara_(Avatar:_The_Last_Airbender)
She strengthens this ability under the tutelage of the Northern Water Tribe's healer Yagoda|katara_(Avatar:_The_Last_Airbender)
She uses it thereafter to relieve sickness; overcome brainwashing; and heal wounds such as burns and bleeding injuries|katara_(Avatar:_The_Last_Airbender)
Nevertheless, she cannot cure all sicknesses, mend brain damage, or heal internal injuries and birth defects|katara_(Avatar:_The_Last_Airbender)
Using special water she obtained from the Northern Water Tribe's Spirit Shrine, she was able to heal a fatal wound Azula inflicted upon Aang, thus reviving him from death|katara_(Avatar:_The_Last_Airbender)
She speculated that she would be able to use that same water to heal the scar on Zuko's face, but was interrupted before she could do so|katara_(Avatar:_The_Last_Airbender)
By the time of The Legend of Korra, Lin Beifong (Toph's metalbender daughter) claims that she is the best healer in the world.|katara_(Avatar:_The_Last_Airbender)
"Katara has another waterbending technique known as ""bloodbending"""|katara_(Avatar:_The_Last_Airbender)
She first used this technique in the eighth episode of Book Three|katara_(Avatar:_The_Last_Airbender)
This ability consists in manipulating the water inside a creature's body, leaving the target unable to move or resist in any way|katara_(Avatar:_The_Last_Airbender)
Once she has taken control, she can make it move in any manner she desires|katara_(Avatar:_The_Last_Airbender)
She is only able to bloodbend during a full moon, when her waterbending power is at its peak|katara_(Avatar:_The_Last_Airbender)
Katara was forced to learn bloodbending by Hama, an elderly Water Tribe woman who originally developed the technique and who wanted Katara to learn it for it to be passed on to others|katara_(Avatar:_The_Last_Airbender)
However, Katara abhors this technique and has only used it twice in times of great stress|katara_(Avatar:_The_Last_Airbender)

In the second season, Azula is fully introduced as the main antagonist, who encounters the Avatar in Omashu, and later attempts to capture him by enlisting her childhood friends Mai and Ty Lee|azula
Azula continues to pursue Aang, Zuko, and Iroh for the rest of the season|azula
After her initial failure to enter the Earth Kingdom capital Ba Sing Se using a giant drill to breach the city's strong outer wall, Azula comes in contact with the Kyoshi Warriors, fighters who, despite their lack of ability to bend any element, dress as and utilize the fighting style of Kyoshi, a past Avatar|azula
Azula along with Mai and Ty Lee proceeds to defeat and impersonate them.Posing as Kyoshi Warriors, Azula and her friends infiltrate Ba Sing Se and befriend Earth King Kuei, who tells them about the planned invasion of the Fire Nation during an upcoming solar eclipse|azula
Azula also comes to understand that the secret police and intelligence agency known as the Dai Li is the key to power in the capital|azula
She is discovered as an infiltrator by Dai Li agents and brought before their imprisoned leader, Long Feng|azula
Having in fact intentionally exposed herself, Azula lulls him into a false sense of control and accepts his offer to help stage a coup d'état against the Earth King and the loyalist Council of Five|azula
Immediately after her seizure of power, Azula betrays Long Feng and assumes permanent leadership of the Dai Li|azula
She also encounters Zuko in the city and convinces him to join her in order to redeem himself|azula

Fire|azula
In the early episodes of this season, Azula bonds with her brother and friends after their victorious return to the Fire Nation with Iroh as a prisoner|azula
However, Azula lies to Ozai by claiming that Zuko killed Aang, as she has a hunch that Aang survived and knows that all the blame would now fall on Zuko if this were true|azula
"During the two-part episode ""The Day of Black Sun,"" Aang assembles an elite invasion force and attacks the capital, taking advantage of a solar eclipse that renders the firebenders powerless"|azula
Having been warned by Azula, Ozai is evacuated to an underground bunker prior to the invasion|azula
Azula and her Dai Li agents stall Aang and his friends Sokka and Toph from finding Ozai before the eclipse, which lasts only eight minutes, allowing the firebenders to retaliate with full force once they regain their bending, causing the invasion to fail|azula
However, Zuko defects to Team Avatar after confronting Ozai during the eclipse.Later, Azula, accompanied by Mai and Ty Lee, visits The Boiling Rock, the top security Fire Nation prison where Zuko has been captured in an attempt to infiltrate the prison and rescue the captured forces of the failed invasion|azula
However, Zuko, Sokka, Suki (leader of the Kyoshi Warriors, who had been captured in the aftermath of their battle with Azula) and Sokka's father Hakoda manages to escape|azula
Mai betrays Azula by aiding the group's escape, proclaiming that she is doing so out of her love for Zuko|azula
Enraged, Azula attempts to attack Mai but is stopped by Ty Lee, who renders her incapable of bending by blocking her chi (the energy within one which one would use for bending)|azula
After having Mai and Ty Lee imprisoned for betraying her, Azula leads a platoon to the Western Air Temple, where she duels with Zuko|azula
The fight ends in a draw, with Azula narrowly escaping death after falling from one of the airships while the protagonists manage to flee.In the finale, Ozai leaves Azula behind in the Fire Nation as he sets out to conquer the world, naming her as his successor to the Fire Lord position|azula
Soon afterward, Azula sinks into psychosis, hallucinates about her long-lost mother, and deposes nearly all of her servants and advisers|azula
Before she is crowned as Fire Lord, Zuko and Katara interrupt the ceremony, whereupon Azula challenges Zuko to single combat in an Agni Kai|azula
However, Azula's attacks, while powerful, are wild and emotional while Zuko's are calm and disciplined; and when his attacks begin to overpower her, she sends a bolt of lightning toward Katara, but ends up striking down Zuko, who attempts to redirect it|azula
She is ultimately defeated by Katara who takes her captive via waterbending, causing Azula to have a complete nervous breakdown|azula

Following the end of the war, Azula is admitted to a psychiatric institution, where she is closely monitored|azula
One year after the war's end, Zuko visits Azula to request her assistance in gaining information from Ozai on the whereabouts of their long-lost mother Ursa, and Azula accepts without asking for anything in return.|azula
When Azula visits Ozai in his prison, they are watched by Fire Lord Zuko before she asks him to leave when their father remains silent in her presence|azula
Azula, having learned of the letters Ursa sent which falsely claims that Fire Lord Zuko is not Ozai's biological son, dodges her brother's questions while distracting him with her bending long enough to access the letters and burn them|azula
She uses this as leverage as she convinces Zuko to allow her to join his quest to find Ursa in return for the letters' information, though she intends to use the letters' content to dethrone her brother while also murdering their mother|azula
Her request is granted, and she becomes a protagonist by joining Team Avatar|azula
The team eventually finds that Ursa lost her memory and assumed the identity of Noriko, starting a new family in her home village|azula
Although Azula nearly kills Ursa, she becomes emotionally confused after her mother apologizes for not showing her enough motherly love and even more after Fire Lord Zuko reveals that he still loves his sister, despite their strained relationship|azula

Azula then escapes and is last seen observing Zuko apologizing to his people for his recent actions|azula
As Azula directly tells Zuko about her supposed intentions and seems to take his speech seriously, she is possibly acting as a stealth mentor by using reverse psychology on Zuko|azula
Azula's current fate is unknown, as she has yet to appear in any later storylines.|azula
Princess Azula appears as an antagonist in the video games Avatar|azula
The Last Airbender – The Burning Earth and Avatar|azula
The Last Airbender – Into the Inferno again voiced by Grey DeLisle.|azula
"Konietzko notes that Azula's design when compared to other main characters ""came together relatively quickly."" Azula was originally going to wear a heavily phoenix-themed armor, though the idea was eventually abandoned"|azula
Azula's blue firebending was meant to symbolize that she was more powerful than Zuko as well as a firebending prodigy, and also to easily distinguish her attacks from his in their fights|azula
She was initially intended to have an arranged marriage during the third season|azula
"Both creators hold the character in high regard; Konietzko believes she is ""by far the most complex, interesting, and dangerous villain in the series"" while DiMartino wrote that she was his favorite villain in the series."|azula
Azula is voiced by Grey DeLisle|azula
"DeLisle recounts that she had studied her ""whole life"" for well-written characters like Azula who were hard to come by"|azula
Overall, DeLisle felt her life had changed positively from the role, and association with the series, relaying this to Janet Varney who would voice Korra in the sequel series.|azula
Although Azula's age is never stated in the series itself, the Avatar website, as well as the book The Earth Kingdom Chronicles, gives her age as fourteen|azula
She is Fire Lord Sozin's great-granddaughter through Ozai, and Avatar Roku's through her mother, Ursa|azula
In another flashback, it is revealed that she is named after her paternal grandfather Azulon, Ozai's father|azula
Even as a child, Azula demonstrated her natural talents early in life, along with her tendency for malice and perfectionism|azula
Her sharp wit and the skill she displayed towards Firebending gained her much attention and acclaim, often at Zuko's expense|azula
"Even when young, Azula suggests that her father would make a better Fire Lord than the heir apparent, her uncle Iroh, whom she dubbed ""a quitter and a loser"" for abandoning his siege of the Earth Kingdom's capital Ba Sing Se, which would have secured the Fire Nation's victory in the war, after the death of his son Lu Ten."|azula
Azula is a firebending prodigy and a dedicated perfectionist|azula
As one who wants nothing less than absolute control, she likewise has remarkable control of herself, seemingly able to react to any situation at a moment's notice without losing her composure|azula
This is shown when she learns of a secret plot to invade the Fire Nation while in disguise but does not react to not blow her cover|azula
Though it's not canonically confirmed, experts speculate that Azula's extremely strong locus of control and her subsequent loss of control was predictive of her later descent into a bout of psychosis.Psychological analyses estimate Azula as being highly intelligent, and as suffering from narcissistic and antisocial personality disorders with notable Machiavellian and, at times, sadistic traits|azula
Following the betrayal by her closest friends Mai and Ty Lee, she possibly develops schizoaffective disorder, as indicated by her delusions of persecution, hallucinations of her mother speaking to her, as well as her frequent and radical intermittent mood fluctuations|azula
The drastic combination of antisocial, narcissistic and Machiavellian traits suggests that Azula appears to suffer from a dark triad personality.|azula
From a young age, Azula had a cruel, sociopathic personality, showing almost no empathy or remorse for actions that harmed others both physically and emotionally|azula
Azula was heavily influenced by her father, who favored her over Zuko due to her superior firebending abilities|azula
However, Azula's father was a ruthless man incapable of true love|azula
Azula was also constantly scolded by her mother due to her cruel nature|azula
This shaped Azula's fears that she could not count on love from anyone, no matter how close they seemed|azula
Unable to trust others, she instead began to control them using fear.|azula
"Although a skilled strategist and capable of predicting her enemies' moves, she is awkward in social situations, and later admits to jealousy of Ty Lee's ability to attract potential sweethearts during ""The Beach"" episode"|azula
She ends up seducing Chan with Ty Lee's advice to act dumb; however, she scares him away when she shows her true personality.|azula
From childhood, Azula believed her mother favored Zuko and thought her monstrous, which she admitted to be true but hurt her deeply|azula
After she was betrayed by Mai and Ty Lee, her mental state gradually collapsed, as her attacks became far more vicious and she was seemingly obsessed with killing Zuko|azula
After her defeat, it is revealed in the graphic novel The Promise that she was admitted into a mental institution in the Fire Nation due to her deranged mental state, possibly suffering from schizophrenia|azula
Both in the series and the comics, she is shown to be disturbed by frequent hallucinations of her mother.|azula
Azula often acts cold-hearted towards her uncle and her brother, but she appears to show some genuine concern for Zuko in the season 2 finale and early episodes of season 3|azula
Although she seems to care about her friends, she frequently manipulates them, as seen when she threatens Ty Lee into leaving the circus in Book 2|azula
There has been only one known occurrence of Azula showing remorse by apologizing after unintentionally insulting Ty Lee.|azula
Azula is highly skilled in firebending, which utilizes Chinese martial arts techniques of Changquan, Shaolinquan, Lóng Xíng Mó Qiáo and Xing Yi Quan|azula
The series' creators consulted a professional martial artist in the design of the show's fighting style|azula
Azula is one of the most skilled firebenders in the show and is a very difficult person to defeat in single combat|azula
Her excellent firebending abilities, hand-to-hand combat skills, intelligence, agility and charisma make her a formidable opponent.|azula
Azula is the only firebender who can produce blue flames, which are hotter and contain more energy (according to Planck's law) than those of other firebenders who bend normal orange flames|azula
Her name is derived from azul, the Spanish, Galician and Portuguese word for blue|azula
However, Azula could not produce blue fire as a young child, as shown in flashbacks|azula
Similarly, her grandfather Azulon was never shown to wield blue flames despite his namesake implying otherwise|azula
Azula can also use her firebending in previously unseen ways, such as jets of flames and whirling disks|azula
She often firebends using only two fingers, rather than a closed fist or open hand common to other firebenders|azula
Azula can fight for long periods of time without tiring|azula
She is also able to generate powerful shields of swirling flames, which she uses to withstand the simultaneous combined attacks of Aang, Katara, Zuko and Toph|azula
She is even able to charge up her fire before releasing it, as was seen during one fight with Aang.Azula is able to propel herself, using her flames, in a manner similar to a rocket|azula
This ability has also been extended as a means to fly for short periods of time as seen in the Boiling Rock|azula
She can also breathe fire, as shown when she is defeated by Katara and Zuko.|azula
"""Lightning is a pure expression of firebending without aggression"|azula
It is not fueled by rage or emotion the way other firebending is|azula
Some call lightning the cold-blooded fire|azula
It is precise and deadly like Azula|azula
"To perform the technique requires peace of mind."""|azula
Azula is a skilled unarmed fighter|azula
"In ""The Avatar State,"" she bests Zuko in combat without resorting to firebending, and in ""The Day of Black Sun,"" she avoids the combined forces of Aang, Toph, and Sokka for several minutes without her bending to aid her"|azula
"In ""Appa's Lost Days,"" when Suki makes a stab attack at Azula with her fan, Azula jumps horizontally and knocks Suki's sword out of her hand and onto a tree.Azula is an expert in persuasion"|azula
She is capable of using psychological warfare, intimidation, and mistruths to con other people into obeying her|azula
"She also has the ability to lie easily without causing any change in her breathing and heart rate (an indication of her psychopathy), making it nearly impossible to detect if she's lying, which she demonstrates in ""The Day of Black Sun."" She is also an accomplished strategist, as she is able to conquer Ba Sing Se, a city thought to be impenetrable while usurping the Earth King and hierarchy of the Earth Kingdom capital all in one swift move."|azula
Critical response to Azula's character has generally been positive|azula
Paste Magazine ranked Azula as the ninth best character from the Avatar universe|azula
"Hollywood.com also included Azula among the ""9 Villains You Should Root For"", commenting that Azula ""proved to be as cunning and vicious a villain as ever appeared on children’s television."" She was also the only female animated character to be featured in the list"|azula

Moviepilot ranked Azula first in the ""Grey Griffin's 6 Greatest Villain Roles"" with writer Mara Mullikin describing her ""a perfectionist"", while also complimenting her ""tactful mind, agility, ruthlessness, manipulative nature and fire bending prowess cemented her as probably being the series' best antagonist.""
