Earth|earth|Earth is the third planet from the Sun and the only astronomical object known to harbour and support life
Earth|earth|29.2% of Earth's surface is land consisting of continents and islands
Earth|earth|The remaining 70.8% is covered with water, mostly by oceans, seas, gulfs, and other salt-water bodies, but also by lakes, rivers, and other freshwater, which together constitute the hydrosphere
Earth|earth|Much of Earth's polar regions are covered in ice
Earth|earth|Earth's outer layer is divided into several rigid tectonic plates[list] that migrate across the surface over many millions of years, while its interior remains active with a solid iron inner core, a liquid outer core that generates Earth's magnetic field, and a convective mantle that drives plate tectonics.
Earth|earth|Earth's atmosphere consists mostly of nitrogen and oxygen
Earth|earth|More solar energy is received by tropical regions than polar regions and is redistributed by atmospheric and ocean circulation
Earth|earth|Greenhouse gases also play an important role in regulating the surface temperature
Earth|earth|A region's climate is not only determined by latitude, but also by elevation and proximity to moderating oceans, among other factors
Earth|earth|Severe weather, such as tropical cyclones, thunderstorms, and heatwaves, occurs in most areas and greatly impacts life.
Earth|earth|Earth's gravity interacts with other objects in space, especially the Moon, which is Earth's only natural satellite
Earth|earth|Earth orbits around the Sun in about 365.25 days
Earth|earth|Earth's axis of rotation is tilted with respect to its orbital plane, producing seasons on Earth
Earth|earth|The gravitational interaction between Earth and the Moon causes tides, stabilizes Earth's orientation on its axis, and gradually slows its rotation
Earth|earth|Earth is the densest planet in the Solar System and the largest and most massive of the four rocky planets.
Earth|earth|According to radiometric dating estimation and other evidence, Earth formed over 4.5 billion years ago
Earth|earth|Within the first billion years of Earth's history, life appeared in the oceans and began to affect Earth's atmosphere and surface, leading to the proliferation of anaerobic and, later, aerobic organisms
Earth|earth|Some geological evidence indicates that life may have arisen as early as 4.1 billion years ago
Earth|earth|Since then, the combination of Earth's distance from the Sun, physical properties, and geological history have allowed life to evolve and thrive
Earth|earth|In the history of life on Earth, biodiversity has gone through long periods of expansion, occasionally punctuated by mass extinctions
Earth|earth|More than 99% of all species that ever lived on Earth are extinct
Earth|earth|Almost 8 billion humans live on Earth and depend on its biosphere and natural resources for their survival
Earth|earth|Humans increasingly impact Earth's surface, hydrology, atmospheric processes, and other life.
Earth|earth|The modern English word  Earth developed, via Middle English, from an Old English noun most often spelled eorðe
Earth|earth|It has cognates in every Germanic language, and their ancestral root has been reconstructed as *erþō
Earth|earth|In its earliest attestation, the word eorðe was already being used to translate the many senses of Latin terra and Greek γῆ gē
Earth|earth|the ground, its soil, dry land, the human world, the surface of the world (including the sea), and the globe itself
Earth|earth|As with Roman Terra/Tellūs and Greek Gaia, Earth may have been a personified goddess in Germanic paganism
Earth|earth|late Norse mythology included Jörð ('Earth'), a giantess often given as the mother of Thor.Historically, earth has been written in lowercase
Earth|earth|"From early Middle English, its definite sense as ""the globe"" was expressed as the earth"
Earth|earth|By Early Modern English, many nouns were capitalized, and the earth was also written the Earth, particularly when referenced along with other heavenly bodies
Earth|earth|More recently, the name is sometimes simply given as Earth, by analogy with the names of the other planets, though earth and forms with the remain common
Earth|earth|House styles now vary
Earth|earth|Oxford spelling recognizes the lowercase form as the most common, with the capitalized form an acceptable variant
Earth|earth|"Another convention capitalizes ""Earth"" when appearing as a name (for example, ""Earth's atmosphere"") but writes it in lowercase when preceded by the (for example, ""the atmosphere of the earth"")"
Earth|earth|"It almost always appears in lowercase in colloquial expressions such as ""what on earth are you doing?""Occasionally, the name Terra  is used in scientific writing and especially in science fiction to distinguish humanity's inhabited planet from others, while in poetry Tellus  has been used to denote personification of the Earth"
Earth|earth|Terra is also the name of the planet in some Romance languages (languages that evolved from Latin) like Italian and Portuguese, while in other Romance languages the word gave rise to names with slightly altered spellings (like the Spanish Tierra and the French Terre)
Earth|earth|The Latinate form Gæa or Gaea (English
Earth|earth|) of the Greek poetic name Gaia (Γαῖα; Ancient Greek
Earth|earth|[ɡâi̯.a] or [ɡâj.ja]) is rare, though the alternative spelling Gaia has become common due to the Gaia hypothesis, in which case its pronunciation is  rather than the more classical English .There are a number of adjectives for the planet Earth
Earth|earth|From Earth itself comes earthly
Earth|earth|From the Latin Terra comes terran , terrestrial , and (via French) terrene , and from the Latin Tellus comes tellurian  and telluric.
Earth|earth|The oldest material found in the Solar System is dated to 4.5682+0.0002−0.0004 Ga (billion years) ago
Earth|earth|By 4.54±0.04 Ga the primordial Earth had formed
Earth|earth|The bodies in the Solar System formed and evolved with the Sun
Earth|earth|In theory, a solar nebula partitions a volume out of a molecular cloud by gravitational collapse, which begins to spin and flatten into a circumstellar disk, and then the planets grow out of that disk with the Sun
Earth|earth|A nebula contains gas, ice grains, and dust (including primordial nuclides)
Earth|earth|According to nebular theory, planetesimals formed by accretion, with the primordial Earth being estimated as likely taking anywhere from 70 to 100 million years to form.Estimates of the age of the Moon range from 4.5 Ga to significantly younger
Earth|earth|A leading hypothesis is that it was formed by accretion from material loosed from Earth after a Mars-sized object with about 10% of Earth's mass, named Theia, collided with Earth
Earth|earth|It hit Earth with a glancing blow and some of its mass merged with Earth
Earth|earth|Between approximately 4.1 and 3.8 Ga, numerous asteroid impacts during the Late Heavy Bombardment caused significant changes to the greater surface environment of the Moon and, by inference, to that of Earth.
Earth|earth|Earth's atmosphere and oceans were formed by volcanic activity and outgassing
Earth|earth|Water vapor from these sources condensed into the oceans, augmented by water and ice from asteroids, protoplanets, and comets
Earth|earth|Sufficient water to fill the oceans may have been on Earth since it formed
Earth|earth|In this model, atmospheric greenhouse gases kept the oceans from freezing when the newly forming Sun had only 70% of its current luminosity
Earth|earth|By 3.5 Ga, Earth's magnetic field was established, which helped prevent the atmosphere from being stripped away by the solar wind.As the molten outer layer of Earth cooled it formed the first solid crust, which is thought to have been mafic in composition
Earth|earth|The first continental crust, which was more felsic in composition, formed by the partial melting of this mafic crust
Earth|earth|The presence of grains of the mineral zircon of Hadean age in Eoarchean sedimentary rocks suggests that at least some felsic crust existed as early as 4.4 Ga, only 140 Ma after Earth's formation
Earth|earth|There are two main models of how this initial small volume of continental crust evolved to reach its current abundance
Earth|earth|(1) a relatively steady growth up to the present day, which is supported by the radiometric dating of continental crust globally and (2) an initial rapid growth in the volume of continental crust during the Archean, forming the bulk of the continental crust that now exists, which is supported by isotopic evidence from hafnium in zircons and neodymium in sedimentary rocks
Earth|earth|The two models and the data that support them can be reconciled by large-scale recycling of the continental crust, particularly during the early stages of Earth's history.New continental crust forms as a result of plate tectonics, a process ultimately driven by the continuous loss of heat from Earth's interior
Earth|earth|Over the period of hundreds of millions of years, tectonic forces have caused areas of continental crust to group together to form supercontinents that have subsequently broken apart
Earth|earth|At approximately 750 Ma, one of the earliest known supercontinents, Rodinia, began to break apart
Earth|earth|The continents later recombined to form Pannotia at 600–540 Ma, then finally Pangaea, which also began to break apart at 180 Ma.The most recent pattern of ice ages began about 40 Ma, and then intensified during the Pleistocene about 3 Ma
Earth|earth|High- and middle-latitude regions have since undergone repeated cycles of glaciation and thaw, repeating about every 21,000, 41,000 and 100,000 years
Earth|earth|"The Last Glacial Period, colloquially called the ""last ice age"", covered large parts of the continents, up to the middle latitudes, in ice and ended about 11,700 years ago."
Earth|earth|Chemical reactions led to the first self-replicating molecules about four billion years ago
Earth|earth|A half billion years later, the last common ancestor of all current life arose
Earth|earth|The evolution of photosynthesis allowed the Sun's energy to be harvested directly by life forms
Earth|earth|The resultant molecular oxygen (O2) accumulated in the atmosphere and due to interaction with ultraviolet solar radiation, formed a protective ozone layer (O3) in the upper atmosphere
Earth|earth|The incorporation of smaller cells within larger ones resulted in the development of complex cells called eukaryotes
Earth|earth|True multicellular organisms formed as cells within colonies became increasingly specialized
Earth|earth|Aided by the absorption of harmful ultraviolet radiation by the ozone layer, life colonized Earth's surface
Earth|earth|Among the earliest fossil evidence for life is microbial mat fossils found in 3.48 billion-year-old sandstone in Western Australia, biogenic graphite found in 3.7 billion-year-old metasedimentary rocks in Western Greenland, and remains of biotic material found in 4.1 billion-year-old rocks in Western Australia
Earth|earth|The earliest direct evidence of life on Earth is contained in 3.45 billion-year-old Australian rocks showing fossils of microorganisms.During the Neoproterozoic, 1000 to 541 Ma, much of Earth might have been covered in ice
Earth|earth|"This hypothesis has been termed ""Snowball Earth"", and it is of particular interest because it preceded the Cambrian explosion, when multicellular life forms significantly increased in complexity"
Earth|earth|Following the Cambrian explosion, 535 Ma, there have been at least five major mass extinctions and many minor ones
Earth|earth|Apart from the proposed current Holocene extinction event, the most recent was 66 Ma, when an asteroid impact triggered the extinction of the non-avian dinosaurs and other large reptiles, but largely spared small animals such as insects, mammals, lizards and birds
Earth|earth|Mammalian life has diversified over the past 66 Mys, and several million years ago an African ape gained the ability to stand upright
Earth|earth|This facilitated tool use and encouraged communication that provided the nutrition and stimulation needed for a larger brain, which led to the evolution of humans
Earth|earth|The development of agriculture, and then civilization, led to humans having an influence on Earth and the nature and quantity of other life forms that continues to this day.
Earth|earth|Because carbon dioxide (CO2) has a long lifespan in the atmosphere, moderate human CO2 emissions may postpone the next glacial inception by 100,000 years.Earth's expected long-term future is tied to that of the Sun
Earth|earth|Over the next 1.1 billion years, solar luminosity will increase by 10%, and over the next 3.5 billion years by 40%
Earth|earth|Earth's increasing surface temperature will accelerate the inorganic carbon cycle, reducing CO2 concentration to levels lethally low for plants (10 ppm for C4 photosynthesis) in approximately 100–900 million years
Earth|earth|The lack of vegetation will result in the loss of oxygen in the atmosphere, making animal life impossible
Earth|earth|Due to the increased luminosity, Earth's mean temperature may reach 100 °C (212 °F) in 1.5 billion years, and all ocean water will evaporate and be lost to space, which may trigger a runaway greenhouse effect, within an estimated 1.6 to 3 billion years
Earth|earth|Even if the Sun were stable, a fraction of the water in the modern oceans will descend to the mantle, due to reduced steam venting from mid-ocean ridges.The Sun will evolve to become a red giant in about 5 billion years
Earth|earth|Models predict that the Sun will expand to roughly 1 AU (150 million km; 93 million mi), about 250 times its present radius
Earth|earth|Earth's fate is less clear
Earth|earth|As a red giant, the Sun will lose roughly 30% of its mass, so, without tidal effects, Earth will move to an orbit 1.7 AU (250 million km; 160 million mi) from the Sun when the star reaches its maximum radius, otherwise, with tidal effects, it may enter the Sun's atmosphere and be vaporized.
Earth|earth|The shape of Earth is nearly spherical
Earth|earth|There is a small flattening at the poles and bulging around the equator due to Earth's rotation
Earth|earth|Therefore, a better approximation of Earth's shape is an oblate spheroid, whose equatorial diameter is 43 kilometres (27 mi) larger than the pole-to-pole diameter.The average diameter of the reference spheroid is 12,742 kilometres (7,918 mi)
Earth|earth|Local topography deviates from this idealized spheroid, although on a global scale these deviations are small compared to Earth's radius
Earth|earth|the maximum deviation of only 0.17% is at the Mariana Trench (10,925 metres or 35,843 feet below local sea level), whereas Mount Everest (8,848 metres or 29,029 feet above local sea level) represents a deviation of 0.14%
Earth|earth|The point on the surface farthest from Earth's center of mass is the summit of the equatorial Chimborazo volcano in Ecuador (6,384.4 km or 3,967.1 mi).In geodesy, the exact shape that Earth's oceans would adopt in the absence of land and perturbations such as tides and winds is called the geoid
Earth|earth|More precisely, the geoid is the surface of gravitational equipotential at mean sea level (MSL).Sea surface topography are water deviations from MSL, analogous to land topography.
Earth|earth|Earth's mass is approximately 5.97×1024 kg (5,970 Yg)
Earth|earth|It is composed mostly of iron (32.1%), oxygen (30.1%), silicon (15.1%), magnesium (13.9%), sulfur (2.9%), nickel (1.8%), calcium (1.5%), and aluminum (1.4%), with the remaining 1.2% consisting of trace amounts of other elements
Earth|earth|Due to mass segregation, the core region is estimated to be primarily composed of iron (88.8%), with smaller amounts of nickel (5.8%), sulfur (4.5%), and less than 1% trace elements.The most common rock constituents of the crust are nearly all oxides
Earth|earth|chlorine, sulfur, and fluorine are the important exceptions to this and their total amount in any rock is usually much less than 1%
Earth|earth|Over 99% of the crust is composed of 11 oxides, principally silica, alumina, iron oxides, lime, magnesia, potash, and soda.
Earth|earth|Earth's interior, like that of the other terrestrial planets, is divided into layers by their chemical or physical (rheological) properties
Earth|earth|The outer layer is a chemically distinct silicate solid crust, which is underlain by a highly viscous solid mantle
Earth|earth|The crust is separated from the mantle by the Mohorovičić discontinuity
Earth|earth|The thickness of the crust varies from about 6 kilometres (3.7 mi) under the oceans to 30–50 km (19–31 mi) for the continents
Earth|earth|The crust and the cold, rigid, top of the upper mantle are collectively known as the lithosphere, which is divided into independently moving tectonic plates.Beneath the lithosphere is the asthenosphere, a relatively low-viscosity layer on which the lithosphere rides
Earth|earth|Important changes in crystal structure within the mantle occur at 410 and 660 km (250 and 410 mi) below the surface, spanning a transition zone that separates the upper and lower mantle
Earth|earth|Beneath the mantle, an extremely low viscosity liquid outer core lies above a solid inner core
Earth|earth|Earth's inner core may be rotating at a slightly higher angular velocity than the remainder of the planet, advancing by 0.1–0.5° per year, although both somewhat higher and much lower rates have also been proposed
Earth|earth|The radius of the inner core is about one-fifth of that of Earth.
Earth|earth|The major heat-producing isotopes within Earth are potassium-40, uranium-238, and thorium-232
Earth|earth|At the center, the temperature may be up to 6,000 °C (10,830 °F), and the pressure could reach 360 GPa (52 million psi)
Earth|earth|Because much of the heat is provided by radioactive decay, scientists postulate that early in Earth's history, before isotopes with short half-lives were depleted, Earth's heat production was much higher
Earth|earth|At approximately 3 Gyr, twice the present-day heat would have been produced, increasing the rates of mantle convection and plate tectonics, and allowing the production of uncommon igneous rocks such as komatiites that are rarely formed today.
Earth|earth|The mean heat loss from Earth is 87 mW m−2, for a global heat loss of 4.42×1013 W
Earth|earth|A portion of the core's thermal energy is transported toward the crust by mantle plumes, a form of convection consisting of upwellings of higher-temperature rock
Earth|earth|These plumes can produce hotspots and flood basalts
Earth|earth|More of the heat in Earth is lost through plate tectonics, by mantle upwelling associated with mid-ocean ridges
Earth|earth|The final major mode of heat loss is through conduction through the lithosphere, the majority of which occurs under the oceans because the crust there is much thinner than that of the continents.
Earth|earth|Earth's mechanically rigid outer layer, the lithosphere, is divided into tectonic plates
Earth|earth|These plates are rigid segments that move relative to each other at one of three boundaries types
Earth|earth|at convergent boundaries, two plates come together; at divergent boundaries, two plates are pulled apart; and at transform boundaries, two plates slide past one another laterally
Earth|earth|Along these plate boundaries, earthquakes, volcanic activity, mountain-building, and oceanic trench formation can occur
Earth|earth|The tectonic plates ride on top of the asthenosphere, the solid but less-viscous part of the upper mantle that can flow and move along with the plates.As the tectonic plates migrate, oceanic crust is subducted under the leading edges of the plates at convergent boundaries
Earth|earth|At the same time, the upwelling of mantle material at divergent boundaries creates mid-ocean ridges
Earth|earth|The combination of these processes recycles the oceanic crust back into the mantle
Earth|earth|Due to this recycling, most of the ocean floor is less than 100 Ma old
Earth|earth|The oldest oceanic crust is located in the Western Pacific and is estimated to be 200 Ma old
Earth|earth|By comparison, the oldest dated continental crust is 4,030 Ma, although zircons have been found preserved as clasts within Eoarchean sedimentary rocks that give ages up to 4,400 Ma, indicating that at least some continental crust existed at that time.The seven major plates are the Pacific, North American, Eurasian, African, Antarctic, Indo-Australian, and South American
Earth|earth|Other notable plates include the Arabian Plate, the Caribbean Plate, the Nazca Plate off the west coast of South America and the Scotia Plate in the southern Atlantic Ocean
Earth|earth|The Australian Plate fused with the Indian Plate between 50 and 55 Ma
Earth|earth|The fastest-moving plates are the oceanic plates, with the Cocos Plate advancing at a rate of 75 mm/a (3.0 in/year) and the Pacific Plate moving 52–69 mm/a (2.0–2.7 in/year)
Earth|earth|At the other extreme, the slowest-moving plate is the South American Plate, progressing at a typical rate of 10.6 mm/a (0.42 in/year).
Earth|earth|The total surface area of Earth is about 510 million km2 (197 million sq mi)
Earth|earth|Of this, 70.8%, or 361.13 million km2 (139.43 million sq mi), is below sea level and covered by ocean water
Earth|earth|Below the ocean's surface are much of the continental shelf, mountains, volcanoes, oceanic trenches, submarine canyons, oceanic plateaus, abyssal plains, and a globe-spanning mid-ocean ridge system
Earth|earth|The remaining 29.2%, or 148.94 million km2 (57.51 million sq mi), not covered by water has terrain that varies greatly from place to place and consists of mountains, deserts, plains, plateaus, and other landforms
Earth|earth|The elevation of the land surface varies from the low point of −418 m (−1,371 ft) at the Dead Sea, to a maximum altitude of 8,848 m (29,029 ft) at the top of Mount Everest
Earth|earth|The mean height of land above sea level is about 797 m (2,615 ft).The continental crust consists of lower density material such as the igneous rocks granite and andesite
Earth|earth|Less common is basalt, a denser volcanic rock that is the primary constituent of the ocean floors
Earth|earth|Sedimentary rock is formed from the accumulation of sediment that becomes buried and compacted together
Earth|earth|Nearly 75% of the continental surfaces are covered by sedimentary rocks, although they form about 5% of the crust
Earth|earth|The third form of rock material found on Earth is metamorphic rock, which is created from the transformation of pre-existing rock types through high pressures, high temperatures, or both
Earth|earth|The most abundant silicate minerals on Earth's surface include quartz, feldspars, amphibole, mica, pyroxene and olivine
Earth|earth|Common carbonate minerals include calcite (found in limestone) and dolomite.Erosion and tectonics, volcanic eruptions, flooding, weathering, glaciation, the growth of coral reefs, and meteorite impacts are among the processes that constantly reshape Earth's surface over geological time.The pedosphere is the outermost layer of Earth's continental surface and is composed of soil and subject to soil formation processes
Earth|earth|The total arable land is 10.9% of the land surface, with 1.3% being permanent cropland
Earth|earth|Close to 40% of Earth's land surface is used for agriculture, or an estimated 16.7 million km2 (6.4 million sq mi) of cropland and 33.5 million km2 (12.9 million sq mi) of pastureland.
Earth|earth|The gravity of Earth is the acceleration that is imparted to objects due to the distribution of mass within Earth
Earth|earth|Near Earth's surface, gravitational acceleration is approximately 9.8 m/s2 (32 ft/s2)
Earth|earth|Local differences in topography, geology, and deeper tectonic structure cause local and broad, regional differences in Earth's gravitational field, known as gravity anomalies.
Earth|earth|The main part of Earth's magnetic field is generated in the core, the site of a dynamo process that converts the kinetic energy of thermally and compositionally driven convection into electrical and magnetic field energy
Earth|earth|The field extends outwards from the core, through the mantle, and up to Earth's surface, where it is, approximately, a dipole
Earth|earth|The poles of the dipole are located close to Earth's geographic poles
Earth|earth|At the equator of the magnetic field, the magnetic-field strength at the surface is 3.05×10−5 T, with a magnetic dipole moment of 7.79×1022 Am2 at epoch 2000, decreasing nearly 6% per century
Earth|earth|The convection movements in the core are chaotic; the magnetic poles drift and periodically change alignment
Earth|earth|This causes secular variation of the main field and field reversals at irregular intervals averaging a few times every million years
Earth|earth|The most recent reversal occurred approximately 700,000 years ago.
Earth|earth|The extent of Earth's magnetic field in space defines the magnetosphere
Earth|earth|Ions and electrons of the solar wind are deflected by the magnetosphere; solar wind pressure compresses the dayside of the magnetosphere, to about 10 Earth radii, and extends the nightside magnetosphere into a long tail
Earth|earth|Because the velocity of the solar wind is greater than the speed at which waves propagate through the solar wind, a supersonic bow shock precedes the dayside magnetosphere within the solar wind
Earth|earth|Charged particles are contained within the magnetosphere; the plasmasphere is defined by low-energy particles that essentially follow magnetic field lines as Earth rotates
Earth|earth|The ring current is defined by medium-energy particles that drift relative to the geomagnetic field, but with paths that are still dominated by the magnetic field, and the Van Allen radiation belts are formed by high-energy particles whose motion is essentially random, but contained in the magnetosphere.During magnetic storms and substorms, charged particles can be deflected from the outer magnetosphere and especially the magnetotail, directed along field lines into Earth's ionosphere, where atmospheric atoms can be excited and ionized, causing the aurora.
Earth|earth|Earth's rotation period relative to the Sun—its mean solar day—is 86,400 seconds of mean solar time (86,400.0025 SI seconds)
Earth|earth|Because Earth's solar day is now slightly longer than it was during the 19th century due to tidal deceleration, each day varies between 0 and 2 ms longer than the mean solar day.Earth's rotation period relative to the fixed stars, called its stellar day by the International Earth Rotation and Reference Systems Service (IERS), is 86,164.0989 seconds of mean solar time (UT1), or 23h 56m 4.0989s
Earth|earth|Earth's rotation period relative to the precessing or moving mean March equinox (when the Sun is at 90° on the equator), is 86,164.0905 seconds of mean solar time (UT1) (23h 56m 4.0905s)
Earth|earth|Thus the sidereal day is shorter than the stellar day by about 8.4 ms.Apart from meteors within the atmosphere and low-orbiting satellites, the main apparent motion of celestial bodies in Earth's sky is to the west at a rate of 15°/h = 15'/min
Earth|earth|For bodies near the celestial equator, this is equivalent to an apparent diameter of the Sun or the Moon every two minutes; from Earth's surface, the apparent sizes of the Sun and the Moon are approximately the same.
Earth|earth|Earth orbits the Sun at an average distance of about 150 million km (93 million mi) every 365.2564 mean solar days, or one sidereal year
Earth|earth|This gives an apparent movement of the Sun eastward with respect to the stars at a rate of about 1°/day, which is one apparent Sun or Moon diameter every 12 hours
Earth|earth|Due to this motion, on average it takes 24 hours—a solar day—for Earth to complete a full rotation about its axis so that the Sun returns to the meridian
Earth|earth|The orbital speed of Earth averages about 29.78 km/s (107,200 km/h; 66,600 mph), which is fast enough to travel a distance equal to Earth's diameter, about 12,742 km (7,918 mi), in seven minutes, and the distance to the Moon, 384,000 km (239,000 mi), in about 3.5 hours.The Moon and Earth orbit a common barycenter every 27.32 days relative to the background stars
Earth|earth|When combined with the Earth-Moon system's common orbit around the Sun, the period of the synodic month, from new moon to new moon, is 29.53 days
Earth|earth|Viewed from the celestial north pole, the motion of Earth, the Moon, and their axial rotations are all counterclockwise
Earth|earth|Viewed from a vantage point above the Sun and Earth's north poles, Earth orbits in a counterclockwise direction about the Sun
Earth|earth|The orbital and axial planes are not precisely aligned
Earth|earth|Earth's axis is tilted some 23.44 degrees from the perpendicular to the Earth-Sun plane (the ecliptic), and the Earth-Moon plane is tilted up to ±5.1 degrees against the Earth-Sun plane
Earth|earth|Without this tilt, there would be an eclipse every two weeks, alternating between lunar eclipses and solar eclipses.The Hill sphere, or the sphere of gravitational influence, of Earth is about 1.5 million km (930,000 mi) in radius
Earth|earth|This is the maximum distance at which Earth's gravitational influence is stronger than the more distant Sun and planets
Earth|earth|Objects must orbit Earth within this radius, or they can become unbound by the gravitational perturbation of the Sun.Earth, along with the Solar System, is situated in the Milky Way and orbits about 28,000 light-years from its center
Earth|earth|It is about 20 light-years above the galactic plane in the Orion Arm.
Earth|earth|The axial tilt of Earth is approximately 23.439281° with the axis of its orbit plane, always pointing towards the Celestial Poles
Earth|earth|Due to Earth's axial tilt, the amount of sunlight reaching any given point on the surface varies over the course of the year
Earth|earth|This causes the seasonal change in climate, with summer in the Northern Hemisphere occurring when the Tropic of Cancer is facing the Sun, and in the Southern Hemisphere when the Tropic of Capricorn faces the Sun
Earth|earth|In each instance, winter occurs simultaneously in the opposite hemisphere
Earth|earth|During the summer, the day lasts longer, and the Sun climbs higher in the sky
Earth|earth|In winter, the climate becomes cooler and the days shorter
Earth|earth|Above the Arctic Circle and below the Antarctic Circle there is no daylight at all for part of the year, causing a polar night, and this night extends for several months at the poles themselves
Earth|earth|These same latitudes also experience a midnight sun, where the sun remains visible all day.By astronomical convention, the four seasons can be determined by the solstices—the points in the orbit of maximum axial tilt toward or away from the Sun—and the equinoxes, when Earth's rotational axis is aligned with its orbital axis
Earth|earth|In the Northern Hemisphere, winter solstice currently occurs around 21 December; summer solstice is near 21 June, spring equinox is around 20 March and autumnal equinox is about 22 or 23 September
Earth|earth|In the Southern Hemisphere, the situation is reversed, with the summer and winter solstices exchanged and the spring and autumnal equinox dates swapped.The angle of Earth's axial tilt is relatively stable over long periods of time
Earth|earth|Its axial tilt does undergo nutation; a slight, irregular motion with a main period of 18.6 years
Earth|earth|The orientation (rather than the angle) of Earth's axis also changes over time, precessing around in a complete circle over each 25,800-year cycle; this precession is the reason for the difference between a sidereal year and a tropical year
Earth|earth|Both of these motions are caused by the varying attraction of the Sun and the Moon on Earth's equatorial bulge
Earth|earth|The poles also migrate a few meters across Earth's surface
Earth|earth|This polar motion has multiple, cyclical components, which collectively are termed quasiperiodic motion
Earth|earth|In addition to an annual component to this motion, there is a 14-month cycle called the Chandler wobble
Earth|earth|Earth's rotational velocity also varies in a phenomenon known as length-of-day variation.In modern times, Earth's perihelion occurs around 3 January, and its aphelion around 4 July
Earth|earth|These dates change over time due to precession and other orbital factors, which follow cyclical patterns known as Milankovitch cycles
Earth|earth|The changing Earth-Sun distance causes an increase of about 6.8% in solar energy reaching Earth at perihelion relative to aphelion
Earth|earth|Because the Southern Hemisphere is tilted toward the Sun at about the same time that Earth reaches the closest approach to the Sun, the Southern Hemisphere receives slightly more energy from the Sun than does the northern over the course of a year
Earth|earth|This effect is much less significant than the total energy change due to the axial tilt, and most of the excess energy is absorbed by the higher proportion of water in the Southern Hemisphere.
Earth|earth|The Moon is a relatively large, terrestrial, planet-like natural satellite, with a diameter about one-quarter of Earth's
Earth|earth|It is the largest moon in the Solar System relative to the size of its planet, although Charon is larger relative to the dwarf planet Pluto
Earth|earth|"The natural satellites of other planets are also referred to as ""moons"", after Earth's"
Earth|earth|The most widely accepted theory of the Moon's origin, the giant-impact hypothesis, states that it formed from the collision of a Mars-size protoplanet called Theia with the early Earth
Earth|earth|This hypothesis explains (among other things) the Moon's relative lack of iron and volatile elements and the fact that its composition is nearly identical to that of Earth's crust.The gravitational attraction between Earth and the Moon causes tides on Earth
Earth|earth|The same effect on the Moon has led to its tidal locking
Earth|earth|its rotation period is the same as the time it takes to orbit Earth
Earth|earth|As a result, it always presents the same face to the planet
Earth|earth|As the Moon orbits Earth, different parts of its face are illuminated by the Sun, leading to the lunar phases
Earth|earth|Due to their tidal interaction, the Moon recedes from Earth at the rate of approximately 38 mm/a (1.5 in/year)
Earth|earth|Over millions of years, these tiny modifications—and the lengthening of Earth's day by about 23 µs/yr—add up to significant changes
Earth|earth|During the Ediacaran period, for example, (approximately 620 Ma) there were 400±7 days in a year, with each day lasting 21.9±0.4 hours.The Moon may have dramatically affected the development of life by moderating the planet's climate
Earth|earth|Paleontological evidence and computer simulations show that Earth's axial tilt is stabilized by tidal interactions with the Moon
Earth|earth|Some theorists think that without this stabilization against the torques applied by the Sun and planets to Earth's equatorial bulge, the rotational axis might be chaotically unstable, exhibiting large changes over millions of years, as is the case for Mars, though this is disputed.Viewed from Earth, the Moon is just far enough away to have almost the same apparent-sized disk as the Sun
Earth|earth|The angular size (or solid angle) of these two bodies match because, although the Sun's diameter is about 400 times as large as the Moon's, it is also 400 times more distant
Earth|earth|This allows total and annular solar eclipses to occur on Earth.
Earth|earth|Earth's co-orbital asteroids population consists of quasi-satellites, objects with a horseshoe orbit and trojans
Earth|earth|There are at least five quasi-satellites, including 469219 Kamoʻoalewa
Earth|earth|A trojan asteroid companion, 2010 TK7, is librating around the leading Lagrange triangular point, L4, in Earth's orbit around the Sun
Earth|earth|The tiny near-Earth asteroid 2006 RH120 makes close approaches to the Earth–Moon system roughly every twenty years
Earth|earth|During these approaches, it can orbit Earth for brief periods of time.As of April 2020, there are 2,666 operational, human-made satellites orbiting Earth
Earth|earth|There are also inoperative satellites, including Vanguard 1, the oldest satellite currently in orbit, and over 16,000 pieces of tracked space debris
Earth|earth|Earth's largest artificial satellite is the International Space Station.
Earth|earth|The abundance of water on Earth's surface is a unique feature that distinguishes it from other planets in the Solar System
Earth|earth|Earth's hydrosphere consists chiefly of the oceans, but technically includes all water surfaces in the world, including inland seas, lakes, rivers, and underground waters down to a depth of 2,000 m (6,600 ft)
Earth|earth|The mass of the oceans is approximately 1.35×1018 metric tons or about 1/4400 of Earth's total mass
Earth|earth|The oceans cover an area of 361.8 million km2 (139.7 million sq mi) with a mean depth of 3,682 m (12,080 ft), resulting in an estimated volume of 1.332 billion km3 (320 million cu mi)
Earth|earth|If all of Earth's crustal surface were at the same elevation as a smooth sphere, the depth of the resulting world ocean would be 2.7 to 2.8 km (1.68 to 1.74 mi)
Earth|earth|About 97.5% of the water is saline; the remaining 2.5% is fresh water
Earth|earth|Most fresh water, about 68.7%, is present as ice in ice caps and glaciers.In Earth's coldest regions, snow survives over the summer and changes into ice
Earth|earth|This accumulated snow and ice eventually forms into glaciers, bodies of ice that flow under the influence of their own gravity
Earth|earth|Alpine glaciers form in mountainous areas, whereas vast ice sheets form over land in polar regions
Earth|earth|The flow of glaciers erodes the surface changing it dramatically, with the formation of U-shaped valleys and other landforms
Earth|earth|Sea ice in the Arctic covers an area about as big as the United States, although it is quickly retreating as a consequence of climate change.The average salinity of Earth's oceans is about 35 grams of salt per kilogram of seawater (3.5% salt)
Earth|earth|Most of this salt was released from volcanic activity or extracted from cool igneous rocks
Earth|earth|The oceans are also a reservoir of dissolved atmospheric gases, which are essential for the survival of many aquatic life forms
Earth|earth|Sea water has an important influence on the world's climate, with the oceans acting as a large heat reservoir
Earth|earth|Shifts in the oceanic temperature distribution can cause significant weather shifts, such as the El Niño–Southern Oscillation.
Earth|earth|The atmospheric pressure at Earth's sea level averages 101.325 kPa (14.696 psi), with a scale height of about 8.5 km (5.3 mi)
Earth|earth|A dry atmosphere is composed of 78.084% nitrogen, 20.946% oxygen, 0.934% argon, and trace amounts of carbon dioxide and other gaseous molecules
Earth|earth|Water vapor content varies between 0.01% and 4% but averages about 1%
Earth|earth|The height of the troposphere varies with latitude, ranging between 8 km (5 mi) at the poles to 17 km (11 mi) at the equator, with some variation resulting from weather and seasonal factors.Earth's biosphere has significantly altered its atmosphere
Earth|earth|Oxygenic photosynthesis evolved 2.7 Gya, forming the primarily nitrogen–oxygen atmosphere of today
Earth|earth|This change enabled the proliferation of aerobic organisms and, indirectly, the formation of the ozone layer due to the subsequent conversion of atmospheric O2 into O3
Earth|earth|The ozone layer blocks ultraviolet solar radiation, permitting life on land
Earth|earth|Other atmospheric functions important to life include transporting water vapor, providing useful gases, causing small meteors to burn up before they strike the surface, and moderating temperature
Earth|earth|This last phenomenon is known as the greenhouse effect
Earth|earth|trace molecules within the atmosphere serve to capture thermal energy emitted from the ground, thereby raising the average temperature
Earth|earth|Water vapor, carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide, and ozone are the primary greenhouse gases in the atmosphere
Earth|earth|Without this heat-retention effect, the average surface temperature would be −18 °C (0 °F), in contrast to the current +15 °C (59 °F), and life on Earth probably would not exist in its current form.
Earth|earth|Earth's atmosphere has no definite boundary, gradually becoming thinner and fading into outer space
Earth|earth|Three-quarters of the atmosphere's mass is contained within the first 11 km (6.8 mi) of the surface; this lowest layer is called the troposphere
Earth|earth|Energy from the Sun heats this layer, and the surface below, causing expansion of the air
Earth|earth|This lower-density air then rises and is replaced by cooler, higher-density air
Earth|earth|The result is atmospheric circulation that drives the weather and climate through redistribution of thermal energy.
Earth|earth|The primary atmospheric circulation bands consist of the trade winds in the equatorial region below 30° latitude and the westerlies in the mid-latitudes between 30° and 60°
Earth|earth|Ocean currents are also important factors in determining climate, particularly the thermohaline circulation that distributes thermal energy from the equatorial oceans to the polar regions.The amount of solar energy reaching the Earth's surface decreases with increasing latitude
Earth|earth|At higher latitudes, the sunlight reaches the surface at lower angles, and it must pass through thicker columns of the atmosphere
Earth|earth|As a result, the mean annual air temperature at sea level decreases by about 0.4 °C (0.7 °F) per degree of latitude from the equator
Earth|earth|Earth's surface can be subdivided into specific latitudinal belts of approximately homogeneous climate
Earth|earth|Ranging from the equator to the polar regions, these are the tropical (or equatorial), subtropical, temperate and polar climates.Further factors that affect a location's climates are its proximity to oceans, the oceanic and atmospheric circulation, and topology
Earth|earth|Places close to oceans typically have colder summers and warmer winters, due to the fact that oceans can store large amounts of heat
Earth|earth|The wind transports the cold or the heat of the ocean to the land
Earth|earth|Atmospheric circulation also plays an important role
Earth|earth|San Francisco and Washington DC are both coastal cities at about the same latitude
Earth|earth|San Francisco's climate is significantly more moderate as the prevailing wind direction is from sea to land
Earth|earth|Finally, temperatures decrease with height causing mountainous areas to be colder than low-lying areas.Water vapor generated through surface evaporation is transported by circulatory patterns in the atmosphere
Earth|earth|When atmospheric conditions permit an uplift of warm, humid air, this water condenses and falls to the surface as precipitation
Earth|earth|Most of the water is then transported to lower elevations by river systems and usually returned to the oceans or deposited into lakes
Earth|earth|This water cycle is a vital mechanism for supporting life on land and is a primary factor in the erosion of surface features over geological periods
Earth|earth|Precipitation patterns vary widely, ranging from several meters of water per year to less than a millimeter
Earth|earth|Atmospheric circulation, topographic features, and temperature differences determine the average precipitation that falls in each region.The commonly used Köppen climate classification system has five broad groups (humid tropics, arid, humid middle latitudes, continental and cold polar), which are further divided into more specific subtypes
Earth|earth|The Köppen system rates regions based on observed temperature and precipitation
Earth|earth|Surface air temperature can rise to around 55 °C (131 °F) in hot deserts, such as Death Valley, and can fall as low as −89 °C (−128 °F) in Antarctica.
Earth|earth|Above the troposphere, the atmosphere is usually divided into the stratosphere, mesosphere, and thermosphere
Earth|earth|Each layer has a different lapse rate, defining the rate of change in temperature with height
Earth|earth|Beyond these, the exosphere thins out into the magnetosphere, where the geomagnetic fields interact with the solar wind
Earth|earth|Within the stratosphere is the ozone layer, a component that partially shields the surface from ultraviolet light and thus is important for life on Earth
Earth|earth|The Kármán line, defined as 100 km (62 mi) above Earth's surface, is a working definition for the boundary between the atmosphere and outer space.Thermal energy causes some of the molecules at the outer edge of the atmosphere to increase their velocity to the point where they can escape from Earth's gravity
Earth|earth|This causes a slow but steady loss of the atmosphere into space
Earth|earth|Because unfixed hydrogen has a low molecular mass, it can achieve escape velocity more readily, and it leaks into outer space at a greater rate than other gases
Earth|earth|The leakage of hydrogen into space contributes to the shifting of Earth's atmosphere and surface from an initially reducing state to its current oxidizing one
Earth|earth|Photosynthesis provided a source of free oxygen, but the loss of reducing agents such as hydrogen is thought to have been a necessary precondition for the widespread accumulation of oxygen in the atmosphere
Earth|earth|Hence the ability of hydrogen to escape from the atmosphere may have influenced the nature of life that developed on Earth
Earth|earth|In the current, oxygen-rich atmosphere most hydrogen is converted into water before it has an opportunity to escape
Earth|earth|Instead, most of the hydrogen loss comes from the destruction of methane in the upper atmosphere.
Earth|earth|A planet's life forms inhabit ecosystems, whose total forms the biosphere
Earth|earth|The biosphere is divided into a number of biomes, inhabited by broadly similar plants and animals
Earth|earth|On land, biomes are separated primarily by differences in latitude, height above sea level and humidity
Earth|earth|Terrestrial biomes lying within the Arctic or Antarctic Circles, at high altitudes or in extremely arid areas are relatively barren of plant and animal life; species diversity reaches a peak in humid lowlands at equatorial latitudes
Earth|earth|Estimates of the number of species on Earth today vary; most species have not been described
Earth|earth|Over 99% of all species that ever lived on Earth are extinct.A planet that can sustain life is termed habitable, even if life did not originate there
Earth|earth|The distance of Earth from the Sun, as well as its orbital eccentricity, rate of rotation, axial tilt, geological history, sustaining atmosphere, and magnetic field all contribute to the current climatic conditions at the surface
Earth|earth|Earth provides liquid water—an environment where complex organic molecules can assemble and interact, and sufficient energy to sustain metabolism
Earth|earth|Plants can take up nutrients from the atmosphere, soils and water
Earth|earth|These nutrients are constantly recycled between different species.Extreme weather, such as tropical cyclones (including hurricanes and typhoons), occurs over most of Earth's surface and has a large impact on life in those areas
Earth|earth|From 1980 to 2000, these events caused an average of 11,800 human deaths per year
Earth|earth|Many places are subject to earthquakes, landslides, tsunamis, volcanic eruptions, tornadoes, blizzards, floods, droughts, wildfires, and other calamities and disasters
Earth|earth|Human impact is felt in many areas due to pollution of the air and water, acid rain, loss of vegetation (overgrazing, deforestation, desertification), loss of wildlife, species extinction, soil degradation, soil depletion and erosion
Earth|earth|Human activities release greenhouse gases into the atmosphere which cause global warming
Earth|earth|This is driving changes such as the melting of glaciers and ice sheets, a global rise in average sea levels, increased risk of drought and wildfires, and migration of species to colder areas.
Earth|earth|Earth's human population passed seven billion in the early 2010s, and is projected to peak at around ten billion in the second half of the 21st century
Earth|earth|Most of the growth is expected to take place in sub-Saharan Africa
Earth|earth|Human population density varies widely around the world, but a majority live in Asia
Earth|earth|By 2050, 68% of the world's population is expected to be living in urban, rather than rural, areas
Earth|earth|The Northern Hemisphere contains 68% of the world's land mass
Earth|earth|Partly due to the predominance of land mass, 90% of humans live in the Northern Hemisphere.It is estimated that one-eighth of Earth's surface is suitable for humans to live on—three-quarters of Earth's surface is covered by oceans, leaving one-quarter as land
Earth|earth|Half of that land area is desert (14%), high mountains (27%), or other unsuitable terrains
Earth|earth|States claim the planet's entire land surface, except for parts of Antarctica and a few other unclaimed areas
Earth|earth|Earth has never had a planetwide government, but the United Nations is the leading worldwide intergovernmental organization.The first human to orbit Earth was Yuri Gagarin on 12 April 1961
Earth|earth|In total, about 550 people have visited outer space and reached orbit as of November 2018, and, of these, twelve have walked on the Moon
Earth|earth|Normally, the only humans in space are those on the International Space Station
Earth|earth|The station's crew, made up of six people, is usually replaced every six months
Earth|earth|The farthest that humans have traveled from Earth is 400,171 km (248,655 mi), achieved during the Apollo 13 mission in 1970.
Earth|earth|Earth has resources that have been exploited by humans
Earth|earth|Those termed non-renewable resources, such as fossil fuels, are only replenished over geological timescales
Earth|earth|Large deposits of fossil fuels are obtained from Earth's crust, consisting of coal, petroleum, and natural gas
Earth|earth|These deposits are used by humans both for energy production and as feedstock for chemical production
Earth|earth|Mineral ore bodies have also been formed within the crust through a process of ore genesis, resulting from actions of magmatism, erosion, and plate tectonics
Earth|earth|These metals and other elements are extracted by mining, a process which often brings environmental and health damage.Earth's biosphere produces many useful biological products for humans, including food, wood, pharmaceuticals, oxygen, and the recycling of organic waste
Earth|earth|The land-based ecosystem depends upon topsoil and fresh water, and the oceanic ecosystem depends on dissolved nutrients washed down from the land
Earth|earth|In 2019, 39 million km2 (15 million sq mi) of Earth's land surface consisted of forest and woodlands, 12 million km2 (4.6 million sq mi) was shrub and grassland, 40 million km2 (15 million sq mi) were used for animal feed production and grazing, and 11 million km2 (4.2 million sq mi) were cultivated as croplands
Earth|earth|Of the 12–14% of ice-free land that is used for croplands, 2 percentage points were irrigated in 2015
Earth|earth|Humans use building materials to construct shelters.
Earth|earth|Human activities, such as the burning of fossil fuels, emit greenhouse gases into the atmosphere of the Earth, altering its climate
Earth|earth|It is estimated that global temperatures in the year 2020 were 1.2 °C (2.2 °F) warmer than the preindustrial baseline
Earth|earth|This increase in temperature, known as global warming, has contributed to the melting of glaciers, rising sea levels, increased risk of drought and wildfires, and migration of species to colder areas.
Earth|earth|Human cultures have developed many views of the planet
Earth|earth|The standard astronomical symbol of Earth consists of a cross circumscribed by a circle, , representing the four corners of the world
Earth|earth|(See also Earth symbol.) Earth is sometimes personified as a deity
Earth|earth|In many cultures it is a mother goddess that is also the primary fertility deity
Earth|earth|Creation myths in many religions involve the creation of Earth by a supernatural deity or deities
Earth|earth|The Gaia hypothesis, developed in the mid-20th century, compared Earth's environments and life as a single self-regulating organism leading to broad stabilization of the conditions of habitability
Earth|earth|Images of Earth taken from space, particularly during the Apollo program, have been credited with altering the way that people viewed the planet that they lived on, emphasizing its beauty, uniqueness and apparent fragility.Scientific investigation has resulted in several culturally transformative shifts in people's view of the planet
Earth|earth|Initial belief in a flat Earth was gradually displaced in Ancient Greece by the idea of a spherical Earth, which was attributed to both the philosophers Pythagoras and Parmenides
Earth|earth|Earth was generally believed to be the center of the universe until the 16th century, when scientists first concluded that it was a moving object, comparable to the other planets in the Solar System.It was only during the 19th century that geologists realized Earth's age was at least many millions of years
Earth|earth|Lord Kelvin used thermodynamics to estimate the age of Earth to be between 20 million and 400 million years in 1864, sparking a vigorous debate on the subject; it was only when radioactivity and radioactive dating were discovered in the late 19th and early 20th centuries that a reliable mechanism for determining Earth's age was established, proving the planet to be billions of years old.
Water|water|Water (chemical formula H2O) is an inorganic, transparent, tasteless, odorless, and nearly colorless chemical substance, which is the main constituent of Earth's hydrosphere and the fluids of all known living organisms (in which it acts as a solvent)
Water|water|It is vital for all known forms of life, even though it provides no calories or organic nutrients
Water|water|Its chemical formula, H2O, indicates that each of its molecules contains one oxygen and two hydrogen atoms, connected by covalent bonds
Water|water|The hydrogen atoms are attached to the oxygen atom at an angle of 104.45°
Water|water|"""Water"" is the name of the liquid state of H2O at standard conditions for temperature and pressure"
Water|water|A number of natural states of water exist
Water|water|It forms precipitation in the form of rain and aerosols in the form of fog
Water|water|Clouds consist of suspended droplets of water and ice, its solid state
Water|water|When finely divided, crystalline ice may precipitate in the form of snow
Water|water|The gaseous state of water is steam or water vapor.
Water|water|Water covers approximately 70.9% of the Earth's surface, mostly in seas and oceans
Water|water|Small portions of water occur as groundwater (1.7%), in the glaciers and the ice caps of Antarctica and Greenland (1.7%), and in the air as vapor, clouds (consisting of ice and liquid water suspended in air), and precipitation (0.001%)
Water|water|Water moves continually through the water cycle of evaporation, transpiration (evapotranspiration), condensation, precipitation, and runoff, usually reaching the sea.
Water|water|Water plays an important role in the world economy
Water|water|Approximately 70% of the freshwater used by humans goes to agriculture
Water|water|Fishing in salt and fresh water bodies is a major source of food for many parts of the world
Water|water|Much of the long-distance trade of commodities (such as oil, natural gas, and manufactured products) is transported by boats through seas, rivers, lakes, and canals
Water|water|Large quantities of water, ice, and steam are used for cooling and heating, in industry and homes
Water|water|Water is an excellent solvent for a wide variety of substances both mineral and organic; as such it is widely used in industrial processes, and in cooking and washing
Water|water|Water, ice and snow are also central to many sports and other forms of entertainment, such as swimming, pleasure boating, boat racing, surfing, sport fishing, diving, ice skating and skiing.
Water|water|"The word water comes from Old English wæter, from Proto-Germanic *watar (source also of Old Saxon watar, Old Frisian wetir, Dutch water, Old High German wazzar, German Wasser, vatn, Gothic 𐍅𐌰𐍄𐍉 (wato), from Proto-Indo-European *wod-or, suffixed form of root *wed- (""water""; ""wet"")"
Water|water|Also cognate, through the Indo-European root, with Greek ύδωρ (ýdor), Russian вода́ (vodá), Irish uisce, and Albanian ujë.
Water|water|Water (H2O) is a polar inorganic compound that is at room temperature a tasteless and odorless liquid, nearly colorless with a hint of blue
Water|water|"This simplest hydrogen chalcogenide is by far the most studied chemical compound and is described as the ""universal solvent"" for its ability to dissolve many substances"
Water|water|"This allows it to be the ""solvent of life"""
Water|water|indeed, water as found in nature almost always includes various dissolved substances, and special steps are required to obtain chemically pure water
Water|water|Water is the only common substance to exist as a solid, liquid, and gas in normal terrestrial conditions.
Water|water|Along with oxidane, water is one of the two official names for the chemical compound H2O; it is also the liquid phase of H2O
Water|water|The other two common states of matter of water are the solid phase, ice, and the gaseous phase, water vapor or steam
Water|water|The addition or removal of heat can cause phase transitions
Water|water|freezing (water to ice), melting (ice to water), vaporization (water to vapor), condensation (vapor to water), sublimation (ice to vapor) and deposition (vapor to ice).
Water|water|Water differs from most liquids in that it becomes less dense as it freezes
Water|water|In 1 atm pressure, it reaches its maximum density of 1,000 kg/m3 (62.43 lb/cu ft) at 3.98 °C (39.16 °F)
Water|water|The density of ice is 917 kg/m3 (57.25 lb/cu ft), an expansion of 9%
Water|water|This expansion can exert enormous pressure, bursting pipes and cracking rocks (see Frost weathering).In a lake or ocean, water at 4 °C (39.2 °F) sinks to the bottom, and ice forms on the surface, floating on the liquid water
Water|water|This ice insulates the water below, preventing it from freezing solid
Water|water|Without this protection, most aquatic organisms would perish during the winter.
Water|water|At a pressure of one atmosphere (atm), ice melts or water freezes at 0 °C (32 °F) and water boils or vapor condenses at 100 °C (212 °F)
Water|water|However, even below the boiling point, water can change to vapor at its surface by evaporation (vaporization throughout the liquid is known as boiling)
Water|water|Sublimation and deposition also occur on surfaces
Water|water|For example, frost is deposited on cold surfaces while snowflakes form by deposition on an aerosol particle or ice nucleus
Water|water|In the process of freeze-drying, a food is frozen and then stored at low pressure so the ice on its surface sublimates.The melting and boiling points depend on pressure
Water|water|A good approximation for the rate of change of the melting temperature with pressure is given by the Clausius–Clapeyron relation:
Water|water|   is the molar latent heat of melting
Water|water|In most substances, the volume increases when melting occurs, so the melting temperature increases with pressure
Water|water|However, because ice is less dense than water, the melting temperature decreases
Water|water|In glaciers, pressure melting can occur under sufficiently thick volumes of ice, resulting in subglacial lakes.The Clausius-Clapeyron relation also applies to the boiling point, but with the liquid/gas transition the vapor phase has a much lower density than the liquid phase, so the boiling point increases with pressure
Water|water|Water can remain in a liquid state at high temperatures in the deep ocean or underground
Water|water|For example, temperatures exceed 205 °C (401 °F) in Old Faithful, a geyser in Yellowstone National Park
Water|water|In hydrothermal vents, the temperature can exceed 400 °C (752 °F).At sea level, the boiling point of water is 100 °C (212 °F)
Water|water|As atmospheric pressure decreases with altitude, the boiling point decreases by 1 °C every 274 meters
Water|water|High-altitude cooking takes longer than sea-level cooking
Water|water|For example, at 1,524 metres (5,000 ft), cooking time must be increased by a fourth to achieve the desired result
Water|water|(Conversely, a pressure cooker can be used to decrease cooking times by raising the boiling temperature.)
Water|water|On a pressure/temperature phase diagram (see figure), there are curves separating solid from vapor, vapor from liquid, and liquid from solid
Water|water|These meet at a single point called the triple point, where all three phases can coexist
Water|water|The triple point is at a temperature of 273.16 K (0.01 °C) and a pressure of 611.657 pascals (0.00604 atm); it is the lowest pressure at which liquid water can exist
Water|water|Until 2019, the triple point was used to define the Kelvin temperature scale.The water/vapor phase curve terminates at 647.096 K (373.946 °C; 705.103 °F) and 22.064 megapascals (3,200.1 psi; 217.75 atm)
Water|water|This is known as the critical point
Water|water|At higher temperatures and pressures the liquid and vapor phases form a continuous phase called a supercritical fluid
Water|water|It can be gradually compressed or expanded between gas-like and liquid-like densities, its properties (which are quite different from those of ambient water) are sensitive to density
Water|water|For example, for suitable pressures and temperatures it can mix freely with nonpolar compounds, including most organic compounds
Water|water|This makes it useful in a variety of applications including high-temperature electrochemistry and as an ecologically benign solvent or catalyst in chemical reactions involving organic compounds
Water|water|In Earth's mantle, it acts as a solvent during mineral formation, dissolution and deposition.
Water|water|The normal form of ice on the surface of Earth is Ice Ih, a phase that forms crystals with hexagonal symmetry
Water|water|Another with cubic crystalline symmetry, Ice Ic, can occur in the upper atmosphere
Water|water|As the pressure increases, ice forms other crystal structures
Water|water|As of 2019, 17 have been experimentally confirmed and several more are predicted theoretically
Water|water|The 18th form of ice, ice XVIII, a face-centred-cubic, superionic ice phase, was discovered when a droplet of water was subject to a shock wave that raised the water’s pressure to millions of atmospheres and its temperature to thousands of degrees, resulting in a structure of rigid oxygen atoms in which hydrogen atoms flowed freely
Water|water|When sandwiched between layers of graphene, ice forms a square lattice.The details of the chemical nature of liquid water are not well understood; some theories suggest that its unusual behaviour is due to the existence of 2 liquid states.
Water|water|Pure water is usually described as tasteless and odorless, although humans have specific sensors that can feel the presence of water in their mouths, and frogs are known to be able to smell it
Water|water|However, water from ordinary sources (including bottled mineral water) usually has many dissolved substances, that may give it varying tastes and odors
Water|water|Humans and other animals have developed senses that enable them to evaluate the potability of water by avoiding water that is too salty or putrid.
Water|water|Pure water is visibly blue due to absorption of light in the region ca
Water|water|600 nm – 800 nm
Water|water|The color can be easily observed in a glass of tap-water placed against a pure white background, in daylight
Water|water|The principal absorption bands responsible for the color are overtones of the O–H stretching vibrations
Water|water|The apparent intensity of the color increases with the depth of the water column, following Beer's law
Water|water|This also applies, for example, with a swimming pool when the light source is sunlight reflected from the pool's white tiles.
Water|water|In industry, near-infrared spectroscopy is used with aqueous solutions as the greater intensity of the lower overtones of water means that glass cuvettes with short path-length may be employed
Water|water|To observe the fundamental stretching absorption spectrum of water or of an aqueous solution in the region around 3500 cm−1 (2.85 μm) a path length of about 25 μm is needed
Water|water|Also, the cuvette must be both transparent around 3500 cm−1 and insoluble in water; calcium fluoride is one material that is in common use for the cuvette windows with aqueous solutions.
Water|water|The refractive index of liquid water (1.333 at 20 °C (68 °F)) is much higher than that of air (1.0), similar to those of alkanes and ethanol, but lower than those of glycerol (1.473), benzene (1.501), carbon disulfide (1.627), and common types of glass (1.4 to 1.6)
Water|water|The refraction index of ice (1.31) is lower than that of liquid water.
Water|water|In a water molecule, the hydrogen atoms form a 104.5° angle with the oxygen atom
Water|water|The hydrogen atoms are close to two corners of a tetrahedron centered on the oxygen
Water|water|At the other two corners are lone pairs of valence electrons that do not participate in the bonding
Water|water|In a perfect tetrahedron, the atoms would form a 109.5° angle, but the repulsion between the lone pairs is greater than the repulsion between the hydrogen atoms
Water|water|The O–H bond length is about 0.096 nm.Other substances have a tetrahedral molecular structure, for example, methane (CH4) and hydrogen sulfide (H2S)
Water|water|However, oxygen is more electronegative (holds on to its electrons more tightly) than most other elements, so the oxygen atom retains a negative charge while the hydrogen atoms are positively charged
Water|water|Along with the bent structure, this gives the molecule an electrical dipole moment and it is classified as a polar molecule.Water is a good polar solvent, that dissolves many salts and hydrophilic organic molecules such as sugars and simple alcohols such as ethanol
Water|water|Water also dissolves many gases, such as oxygen and carbon dioxide—the latter giving the fizz of carbonated beverages, sparkling wines and beers
Water|water|In addition, many substances in living organisms, such as proteins, DNA and polysaccharides, are dissolved in water
Water|water|The interactions between water and the subunits of these biomacromolecules shape protein folding, DNA base pairing, and other phenomena crucial to life (hydrophobic effect).
Water|water|Many organic substances (such as fats and oils and alkanes) are hydrophobic, that is, insoluble in water
Water|water|Many inorganic substances are insoluble too, including most metal oxides, sulfides, and silicates.
Water|water|Because of its polarity, a molecule of water in the liquid or solid state can form up to four hydrogen bonds with neighboring molecules
Water|water|Hydrogen bonds are about ten times as strong as the Van der Waals force that attracts molecules to each other in most liquids
Water|water|This is the reason why the melting and boiling points of water are much higher than those of other analogous compounds like hydrogen sulfide
Water|water|They also explain its exceptionally high specific heat capacity (about 4.2 J/g/K), heat of fusion (about 333 J/g), heat of vaporization (2257 J/g), and thermal conductivity (between 0.561 and 0.679 W/m/K)
Water|water|These properties make water more effective at moderating Earth's climate, by storing heat and transporting it between the oceans and the atmosphere
Water|water|The hydrogen bonds of water are around 23 kJ/mol (compared to a covalent O-H bond at 492 kJ/mol)
Water|water|Of this, it is estimated that 90% is attributable to electrostatics, while the remaining 10% is partially covalent.These bonds are the cause of water's high surface tension and capillary forces
Water|water|The capillary action refers to the tendency of water to move up a narrow tube against the force of gravity
Water|water|This property is relied upon by all vascular plants, such as trees.
Water|water|Liquid water can be split into the elements hydrogen and oxygen by passing an electric current through it—a process called electrolysis
Water|water|The decomposition requires more energy input than the heat released by the inverse process (285.8 kJ/mol, or 15.9 MJ/kg).
Water|water|Liquid water can be assumed to be incompressible for most purposes
Water|water|its compressibility ranges from 4.4 to 5.1×10−10 Pa−1 in ordinary conditions
Water|water|Even in oceans at 4 km depth, where the pressure is 400 atm, water suffers only a 1.8% decrease in volume.The viscosity of water is about 10−3 Pa·s or 0.01 poise at 20 °C (68 °F), and the speed of sound in liquid water ranges between 1,400 and 1,540 meters per second (4,600 and 5,100 ft/s) depending on temperature
Water|water|Sound travels long distances in water with little attenuation, especially at low frequencies (roughly 0.03 dB/km for 1 kHz), a property that is exploited by cetaceans and humans for communication and environment sensing (sonar).
Water|water|Metallic elements which are more electropositive than hydrogen, particularly the alkali metals and alkaline earth metals such as lithium, sodium, calcium, potassium and cesium displace hydrogen from water, forming hydroxides and releasing hydrogen
Water|water|At high temperatures, carbon reacts with steam to form carbon monoxide and hydrogen.
Water|water|Hydrology is the study of the movement, distribution, and quality of water throughout the Earth
Water|water|The study of the distribution of water is hydrography
Water|water|The study of the distribution and movement of groundwater is hydrogeology, of glaciers is glaciology, of inland waters is limnology and distribution of oceans is oceanography
Water|water|Ecological processes with hydrology are in the focus of ecohydrology.
Water|water|The collective mass of water found on, under, and over the surface of a planet is called the hydrosphere
Water|water|Earth's approximate water volume (the total water supply of the world) is 1.386 × 109 cubic kilometers (3.33 × 108 cubic miles).Liquid water is found in bodies of water, such as an ocean, sea, lake, river, stream, canal, pond, or puddle
Water|water|The majority of water on Earth is sea water
Water|water|Water is also present in the atmosphere in solid, liquid, and vapor states
Water|water|It also exists as groundwater in aquifers.
Water|water|Water is important in many geological processes
Water|water|Groundwater is present in most rocks, and the pressure of this groundwater affects patterns of faulting
Water|water|Water in the mantle is responsible for the melt that produces volcanoes at subduction zones
Water|water|On the surface of the Earth, water is important in both chemical and physical weathering processes
Water|water|Water, and to a lesser but still significant extent, ice, are also responsible for a large amount of sediment transport that occurs on the surface of the earth
Water|water|Deposition of transported sediment forms many types of sedimentary rocks, which make up the geologic record of Earth history.
Water|water|runoff from the land usually reaching the sea.Most water vapors found mostly in the ocean returns to it, but winds carry water vapor over land at the same rate as runoff into the sea, about 47 Tt per year whilst evaporation and transpiration happening in land masses also contribute another 72 Tt per year
Water|water|Precipitation, at a rate of 119 Tt per year over land, has several forms
Water|water|most commonly rain, snow, and hail, with some contribution from fog and dew
Water|water|Dew is small drops of water that are condensed when a high density of water vapor meets a cool surface
Water|water|Dew usually forms in the morning when the temperature is the lowest, just before sunrise and when the temperature of the earth's surface starts to increase
Water|water|Condensed water in the air may also refract sunlight to produce rainbows.
Water|water|Water runoff often collects over watersheds flowing into rivers
Water|water|A mathematical model used to simulate river or stream flow and calculate water quality parameters is a hydrological transport model
Water|water|Some water is diverted to irrigation for agriculture
Water|water|Rivers and seas offer opportunities for travel and commerce
Water|water|Through erosion, runoff shapes the environment creating river valleys and deltas which provide rich soil and level ground for the establishment of population centers
Water|water|A flood occurs when an area of land, usually low-lying, is covered with water which occurs when a river overflows its banks or a storm surge happens
Water|water|On the other hand, drought is an extended period of months or years when a region notes a deficiency in its water supply
Water|water|This occurs when a region receives consistently below average precipitation either due to its topography or due to its location in terms of latitude.
Water|water|"Water occurs as both ""stocks"" and ""flows"""
Water|water|Water can be stored as lakes, water vapor, groundwater or aquifers, and ice and snow
Water|water|Of the total volume of global freshwater, an estimated 69 percent is stored in glaciers and permanent snow cover; 30 percent is in groundwater; and the remaining 1 percent in lakes, rivers, the atmosphere, and biota
Water|water|The length of time water remains in storage is highly variable
Water|water|some aquifers consist of water stored over thousands of years but lake volumes may fluctuate on a seasonal basis, decreasing during dry periods and increasing during wet ones
Water|water|A substantial fraction of the water supply for some regions consists of water extracted from water stored in stocks, and when withdrawals exceed recharge, stocks decrease
Water|water|By some estimates, as much as 30 percent of total water used for irrigation comes from unsustainable withdrawals of groundwater, causing groundwater depletion.
Water|water|Sea water contains about 3.5% sodium chloride on average, plus smaller amounts of other substances
Water|water|The physical properties of seawater differ from fresh water in some important respects
Water|water|It freezes at a lower temperature (about −1.9 °C (28.6 °F)) and its density increases with decreasing temperature to the freezing point, instead of reaching maximum density at a temperature above freezing
Water|water|The salinity of water in major seas varies from about 0.7% in the Baltic Sea to 4.0% in the Red Sea
Water|water|(The Dead Sea, known for its ultra-high salinity levels of between 30–40%, is really a salt lake.)
Water|water|Tides are the cyclic rising and falling of local sea levels caused by the tidal forces of the Moon and the Sun acting on the oceans
Water|water|Tides cause changes in the depth of the marine and estuarine water bodies and produce oscillating currents known as tidal streams
Water|water|The changing tide produced at a given location is the result of the changing positions of the Moon and Sun relative to the Earth coupled with the effects of Earth rotation and the local bathymetry
Water|water|The strip of seashore that is submerged at high tide and exposed at low tide, the intertidal zone, is an important ecological product of ocean tides.
Water|water|From a biological standpoint, water has many distinct properties that are critical for the proliferation of life
Water|water|It carries out this role by allowing organic compounds to react in ways that ultimately allow replication
Water|water|All known forms of life depend on water
Water|water|Water is vital both as a solvent in which many of the body's solutes dissolve and as an essential part of many metabolic processes within the body
Water|water|Metabolism is the sum total of anabolism and catabolism
Water|water|In anabolism, water is removed from molecules (through energy requiring enzymatic chemical reactions) in order to grow larger molecules (e.g., starches, triglycerides, and proteins for storage of fuels and information)
Water|water|In catabolism, water is used to break bonds in order to generate smaller molecules (e.g., glucose, fatty acids, and amino acids to be used for fuels for energy use or other purposes)
Water|water|Without water, these particular metabolic processes could not exist.
Water|water|Water is fundamental to photosynthesis and respiration
Water|water|Photosynthetic cells use the sun's energy to split off water's hydrogen from oxygen
Water|water|Hydrogen is combined with CO2 (absorbed from air or water) to form glucose and release oxygen
Water|water|All living cells use such fuels and oxidize the hydrogen and carbon to capture the sun's energy and reform water and CO2 in the process (cellular respiration).
Water|water|Water is also central to acid-base neutrality and enzyme function
Water|water|An acid, a hydrogen ion (H+, that is, a proton) donor, can be neutralized by a base, a proton acceptor such as a hydroxide ion (OH−) to form water
Water|water|Water is considered to be neutral, with a pH (the negative log of the hydrogen ion concentration) of 7
Water|water|Acids have pH values less than 7 while bases have values greater than 7.
Water|water|Earth surface waters are filled with life
Water|water|The earliest life forms appeared in water; nearly all fish live exclusively in water, and there are many types of marine mammals, such as dolphins and whales
Water|water|Some kinds of animals, such as amphibians, spend portions of their lives in water and portions on land
Water|water|Plants such as kelp and algae grow in the water and are the basis for some underwater ecosystems
Water|water|Plankton is generally the foundation of the ocean food chain.
Water|water|Aquatic vertebrates must obtain oxygen to survive, and they do so in various ways
Water|water|Fish have gills instead of lungs, although some species of fish, such as the lungfish, have both
Water|water|Marine mammals, such as dolphins, whales, otters, and seals need to surface periodically to breathe air
Water|water|Some amphibians are able to absorb oxygen through their skin
Water|water|Invertebrates exhibit a wide range of modifications to survive in poorly oxygenated waters including breathing tubes (see insect and mollusc siphons) and gills (Carcinus)
Water|water|However, as invertebrate life evolved in an aquatic habitat most have little or no specialization for respiration in water.
Water|water|Civilization has historically flourished around rivers and major waterways; Mesopotamia, the so-called cradle of civilization, was situated between the major rivers Tigris and Euphrates; the ancient society of the Egyptians depended entirely upon the Nile
Water|water|The early Indus Valley Civilization (c
Water|water|3300 BCE to 1300 BCE) developed along the Indus River and tributaries that flowed out of the Himalayas
Water|water|Rome was also founded on the banks of the Italian river Tiber
Water|water|Large metropolises like Rotterdam, London, Montreal, Paris, New York City, Buenos Aires, Shanghai, Tokyo, Chicago, and Hong Kong owe their success in part to their easy accessibility via water and the resultant expansion of trade
Water|water|Islands with safe water ports, like Singapore, have flourished for the same reason
Water|water|In places such as North Africa and the Middle East, where water is more scarce, access to clean drinking water was and is a major factor in human development.
Water|water|Water fit for human consumption is called drinking water or potable water
Water|water|Water that is not potable may be made potable by filtration or distillation, or by a range of other methods
Water|water|"More than 660 million people do not have access to safe drinking water.Water that is not fit for drinking but is not harmful to humans when used for swimming or bathing is called by various names other than potable or drinking water, and is sometimes called safe water, or ""safe for bathing"""
Water|water|Chlorine is a skin and mucous membrane irritant that is used to make water safe for bathing or drinking
Water|water|Its use is highly technical and is usually monitored by government regulations (typically 1 part per million (ppm) for drinking water, and 1–2 ppm of chlorine not yet reacted with impurities for bathing water)
Water|water|Water for bathing may be maintained in satisfactory microbiological condition using chemical disinfectants such as chlorine or ozone or by the use of ultraviolet light.
Water|water|Water reclamation is the process of converting wastewater (most commonly sewage, also called municipal wastewater) into water that can be reused for other purposes
Water|water|Freshwater is a renewable resource, recirculated by the natural hydrologic cycle, but pressures over access to it result from the naturally uneven distribution in space and time, growing economic demands by agriculture and industry, and rising populations
Water|water|Currently, nearly a billion people around the world lack access to safe, affordable water
Water|water|In 2000, the United Nations established the Millennium Development Goals for water to halve by 2015 the proportion of people worldwide without access to safe water and sanitation
Water|water|Progress toward that goal was uneven, and in 2015 the UN committed to the Sustainable Development Goals of achieving universal access to safe and affordable water and sanitation by 2030
Water|water|Poor water quality and bad sanitation are deadly; some five million deaths a year are caused by water-related diseases
Water|water|The World Health Organization estimates that safe water could prevent 1.4 million child deaths from diarrhoea each year.In developing countries, 90% of all municipal wastewater still goes untreated into local rivers and streams
Water|water|Some 50 countries, with roughly a third of the world's population, also suffer from medium or high water scarcity and 17 of these extract more water annually than is recharged through their natural water cycles
Water|water|The strain not only affects surface freshwater bodies like rivers and lakes, but it also degrades groundwater resources.
Water|water|The most substantial human use of water is for agriculture, including irrigated agriculture, which accounts for as much as 80 to 90 percent of total human water consumption
Water|water|"In the United States, 42% of freshwater withdrawn for use is for irrigation, but the vast majority of water ""consumed"" (used and not returned to the environment) goes to agriculture.Access to fresh water is often taken for granted, especially in developed countries that have build sophisticated water systems for collecting, purifying, and delivering water, and removing wastewater"
Water|water|But growing economic, demographic, and climatic pressures are increasing concerns about water issues, leading to increasing competition for fixed water resources, giving rise to the concept of peak water
Water|water|As populations and economies continue to grow, consumption of water-thirsty meat expands, and new demands rise for biofuels or new water-intensive industries, new water challenges are likely.An assessment of water management in agriculture was conducted in 2007 by the International Water Management Institute in Sri Lanka to see if the world had sufficient water to provide food for its growing population
Water|water|It assessed the current availability of water for agriculture on a global scale and mapped out locations suffering from water scarcity
Water|water|It found that a fifth of the world's people, more than 1.2 billion, live in areas of physical water scarcity, where there is not enough water to meet all demands
Water|water|A further 1.6 billion people live in areas experiencing economic water scarcity, where the lack of investment in water or insufficient human capacity make it impossible for authorities to satisfy the demand for water
Water|water|The report found that it would be possible to produce the food required in the future, but that continuation of today's food production and environmental trends would lead to crises in many parts of the world
Water|water|To avoid a global water crisis, farmers will have to strive to increase productivity to meet growing demands for food, while industries and cities find ways to use water more efficiently.Water scarcity is also caused by production of water intensive products
Water|water|For example, cotton
Water|water|1 kg of cotton—equivalent of a pair of jeans—requires 10.9 cubic meters (380 cu ft) water to produce
Water|water|While cotton accounts for 2.4% of world water use, the water is consumed in regions that are already at a risk of water shortage
Water|water|Significant environmental damage has been caused
Water|water|for example, the diversion of water by the former Soviet Union from the Amu Darya and Syr Darya rivers to produce cotton was largely responsible for the disappearance of the Aral Sea.
Water|water|"On 7 April 1795, the gram was defined in France to be equal to ""the absolute weight of a volume of pure water equal to a cube of one-hundredth of a meter, and at the temperature of melting ice"""
Water|water|For practical purposes though, a metallic reference standard was required, one thousand times more massive, the kilogram
Water|water|Work was therefore commissioned to determine precisely the mass of one liter of water
Water|water|In spite of the fact that the decreed definition of the gram specified water at 0 °C (32 °F)—a highly reproducible temperature—the scientists chose to redefine the standard and to perform their measurements at the temperature of highest water density, which was measured at the time as 4 °C (39 °F).The Kelvin temperature scale of the SI system was based on the triple point of water, defined as exactly 273.16 K (0.01 °C; 32.02 °F), but as of May 2019 is based on the Boltzmann constant instead
Water|water|The scale is an absolute temperature scale with the same increment as the Celsius temperature scale, which was originally defined according to the boiling point (set to 100 °C (212 °F)) and melting point (set to 0 °C (32 °F)) of water.
Water|water|Natural water consists mainly of the isotopes hydrogen-1 and oxygen-16, but there is also a small quantity of heavier isotopes oxygen-18, oxygen-17, and hydrogen-2 (deuterium)
Water|water|The percentage of the heavier isotopes is very small, but it still affects the properties of water
Water|water|Water from rivers and lakes tends to contain less heavy isotopes than seawater
Water|water|Therefore, standard water is defined in the Vienna Standard Mean Ocean Water specification.
Water|water|The human body contains from 55% to 78% water, depending on body size
Water|water|To function properly, the body requires between one and seven liters (0.22 and 1.54 imp gal; 0.26 and 1.85 U.S
Water|water|gal) of water per day to avoid dehydration; the precise amount depends on the level of activity, temperature, humidity, and other factors
Water|water|Most of this is ingested through foods or beverages other than drinking straight water
Water|water|It is not clear how much water intake is needed by healthy people, though the British Dietetic Association advises that 2.5 liters of total water daily is the minimum to maintain proper hydration, including 1.8 liters (6 to 7 glasses) obtained directly from beverages
Water|water|Medical literature favors a lower consumption, typically 1 liter of water for an average male, excluding extra requirements due to fluid loss from exercise or warm weather.Healthy kidneys can excrete 0.8 to 1 liter of water per hour, but stress such as exercise can reduce this amount
Water|water|People can drink far more water than necessary while exercising, putting them at risk of water intoxication (hyperhydration), which can be fatal
Water|water|"The popular claim that ""a person should consume eight glasses of water per day"" seems to have no real basis in science"
Water|water|Studies have shown that extra water intake, especially up to 500 milliliters (18 imp fl oz; 17 U.S
Water|water|fl oz) at mealtime was associated with weight loss
Water|water|Adequate fluid intake is helpful in preventing constipation.
Water|water|An original recommendation for water intake in 1945 by the Food and Nutrition Board of the United States National Research Council read
Water|water|"""An ordinary standard for diverse persons is 1 milliliter for each calorie of food"
Water|water|"Most of this quantity is contained in prepared foods."" The latest dietary reference intake report by the United States National Research Council in general recommended, based on the median total water intake from US survey data (including food sources)"
Water|water|3.7 liters (0.81 imp gal; 0.98 U.S
Water|water|gal) for men and 2.7 liters (0.59 imp gal; 0.71 U.S
Water|water|gal) of water total for women, noting that water contained in food provided approximately 19% of total water intake in the survey.Specifically, pregnant and breastfeeding women need additional fluids to stay hydrated
Water|water|The Institute of Medicine (US) recommends that, on average, men consume 3 liters (0.66 imp gal; 0.79 U.S
Water|water|gal) and women 2.2 liters (0.48 imp gal; 0.58 U.S
Water|water|gal); pregnant women should increase intake to 2.4 liters (0.53 imp gal; 0.63 U.S
Water|water|gal) and breastfeeding women should get 3 liters (12 cups), since an especially large amount of fluid is lost during nursing
Water|water|Also noted is that normally, about 20% of water intake comes from food, while the rest comes from drinking water and beverages (caffeinated included)
Water|water|Water is excreted from the body in multiple forms; through urine and feces, through sweating, and by exhalation of water vapor in the breath
Water|water|With physical exertion and heat exposure, water loss will increase and daily fluid needs may increase as well.
Water|water|Humans require water with few impurities
Water|water|Common impurities include metal salts and oxides, including copper, iron, calcium and lead, and/or harmful bacteria, such as Vibrio
Water|water|Some solutes are acceptable and even desirable for taste enhancement and to provide needed electrolytes.The single largest (by volume) freshwater resource suitable for drinking is Lake Baikal in Siberia.
Water|water|The propensity of water to form solutions and emulsions is useful in various washing processes
Water|water|Washing is also an important component of several aspects of personal body hygiene
Water|water|Most of the personal water use is due to showering, doing the laundry and dishwashing, reaching hundreds of liters per day per person in developed countries.
Water|water|Water is widely used in chemical reactions as a solvent or reactant and less commonly as a solute or catalyst
Water|water|In inorganic reactions, water is a common solvent, dissolving many ionic compounds, as well as other polar compounds such as ammonia and compounds closely related to water
Water|water|In organic reactions, it is not usually used as a reaction solvent, because it does not dissolve the reactants well and is amphoteric (acidic and basic) and nucleophilic
Water|water|Nevertheless, these properties are sometimes desirable
Water|water|Also, acceleration of Diels-Alder reactions by water has been observed
Water|water|Supercritical water has recently been a topic of research
Water|water|Oxygen-saturated supercritical water combusts organic pollutants efficiently
Water|water|Water vapor is used for some processes in the chemical industry
Water|water|An example is the production of acrylic acid from acrolein, propylene and propane
Water|water|The possible effect of water in these reactions includes the physical-, chemical interaction of water with the catalyst and the chemical reaction of water with the reaction intermediates.
Water|water|Water and steam are a common fluid used for heat exchange, due to its availability and high heat capacity, both for cooling and heating
Water|water|Cool water may even be naturally available from a lake or the sea
Water|water|It's especially effective to transport heat through vaporization and condensation of water because of its large latent heat of vaporization
Water|water|A disadvantage is that metals commonly found in industries such as steel and copper are oxidized faster by untreated water and steam
Water|water|In almost all thermal power stations, water is used as the working fluid (used in a closed-loop between boiler, steam turbine, and condenser), and the coolant (used to exchange the waste heat to a water body or carry it away by evaporation in a cooling tower)
Water|water|In the United States, cooling power plants is the largest use of water.In the nuclear power industry, water can also be used as a neutron moderator
Water|water|In most nuclear reactors, water is both a coolant and a moderator
Water|water|This provides something of a passive safety measure, as removing the water from the reactor also slows the nuclear reaction down
Water|water|However other methods are favored for stopping a reaction and it is preferred to keep the nuclear core covered with water so as to ensure adequate cooling.
Water|water|Water has a high heat of vaporization and is relatively inert, which makes it a good fire extinguishing fluid
Water|water|The evaporation of water carries heat away from the fire
Water|water|It is dangerous to use water on fires involving oils and organic solvents because many organic materials float on water and the water tends to spread the burning liquid.
Water|water|The power of such explosions was seen in the Chernobyl disaster, although the water involved in this case did not come from fire-fighting but from the reactor's own water cooling system
Water|water|A steam explosion occurred when the extreme overheating of the core caused water to flash into steam
Water|water|A hydrogen explosion may have occurred as a result of a reaction between steam and hot zirconium.
Water|water|Some metallic oxides, most notably those of alkali metals and alkaline earth metals, produce so much heat on reaction with water that a fire hazard can develop
Water|water|The alkaline earth oxide quicklime is a mass-produced substance that is often transported in paper bags
Water|water|If these are soaked through, they may ignite as their contents react with water.
Water|water|Humans use water for many recreational purposes, as well as for exercising and for sports
Water|water|Some of these include swimming, waterskiing, boating, surfing and diving
Water|water|In addition, some sports, like ice hockey and ice skating, are played on ice
Water|water|Lakesides, beaches and water parks are popular places for people to go to relax and enjoy recreation
Water|water|Many find the sound and appearance of flowing water to be calming, and fountains and other water features are popular decorations
Water|water|Some keep fish and other flora and fauna inside aquariums or ponds for show, fun, and companionship
Water|water|Humans also use water for snow sports i.e
Water|water|skiing, sledding, snowmobiling or snowboarding, which require the water to be frozen.
Water|water|The water industry provides drinking water and wastewater services (including sewage treatment) to households and industry
Water|water|Water supply facilities include water wells, cisterns for rainwater harvesting, water supply networks, and water purification facilities, water tanks, water towers, water pipes including old aqueducts
Water|water|Atmospheric water generators are in development.
Water|water|Drinking water is often collected at springs, extracted from artificial borings (wells) in the ground, or pumped from lakes and rivers
Water|water|Building more wells in adequate places is thus a possible way to produce more water, assuming the aquifers can supply an adequate flow
Water|water|Other water sources include rainwater collection
Water|water|Water may require purification for human consumption
Water|water|This may involve the removal of undissolved substances, dissolved substances and harmful microbes
Water|water|Popular methods are filtering with sand which only removes undissolved material, while chlorination and boiling kill harmful microbes
Water|water|Distillation does all three functions
Water|water|More advanced techniques exist, such as reverse osmosis
Water|water|Desalination of abundant seawater is a more expensive solution used in coastal arid climates.
Water|water|The distribution of drinking water is done through municipal water systems, tanker delivery or as bottled water
Water|water|Governments in many countries have programs to distribute water to the needy at no charge.
Water|water|Reducing usage by using drinking (potable) water only for human consumption is another option
Water|water|In some cities such as Hong Kong, seawater is extensively used for flushing toilets citywide in order to conserve freshwater resources.
Water|water|Polluting water may be the biggest single misuse of water; to the extent that a pollutant limits other uses of the water, it becomes a waste of the resource, regardless of benefits to the polluter
Water|water|Like other types of pollution, this does not enter standard accounting of market costs, being conceived as externalities for which the market cannot account
Water|water|Thus other people pay the price of water pollution, while the private firms' profits are not redistributed to the local population, victims of this pollution
Water|water|Pharmaceuticals consumed by humans often end up in the waterways and can have detrimental effects on aquatic life if they bioaccumulate and if they are not biodegradable.
Water|water|Municipal and industrial wastewater are typically treated at wastewater treatment plants
Water|water|Mitigation of polluted surface runoff is addressed through a variety of prevention and treatment techniques
Water|water|(See Surface runoff#Mitigation and treatment.)
Water|water|Many industrial processes rely on reactions using chemicals dissolved in water, suspension of solids in water slurries or using water to dissolve and extract substances, or to wash products or process equipment
Water|water|Processes such as mining, chemical pulping, pulp bleaching, paper manufacturing, textile production, dyeing, printing, and cooling of power plants use large amounts of water, requiring a dedicated water source, and often cause significant water pollution.
Water|water|Water is used in power generation
Water|water|Hydroelectricity is electricity obtained from hydropower
Water|water|Hydroelectric power comes from water driving a water turbine connected to a generator
Water|water|Hydroelectricity is a low-cost, non-polluting, renewable energy source
Water|water|The energy is supplied by the motion of water
Water|water|Typically a dam is constructed on a river, creating an artificial lake behind it
Water|water|Water flowing out of the lake is forced through turbines that turn generators.
Water|water|Pressurized water is used in water blasting and water jet cutters
Water|water|Also, high pressure water guns are used for precise cutting
Water|water|It works very well, is relatively safe, and is not harmful to the environment
Water|water|It is also used in the cooling of machinery to prevent overheating, or prevent saw blades from overheating.
Water|water|Water is also used in many industrial processes and machines, such as the steam turbine and heat exchanger, in addition to its use as a chemical solvent
Water|water|Discharge of untreated water from industrial uses is pollution
Water|water|Pollution includes discharged solutes (chemical pollution) and discharged coolant water (thermal pollution)
Water|water|Industry requires pure water for many applications and utilizes a variety of purification techniques both in water supply and discharge.
Water|water|Boiling, steaming, and simmering are popular cooking methods that often require immersing food in water or its gaseous state, steam
Water|water|Water is also used for dishwashing
Water|water|Water also plays many critical roles within the field of food science.
Water|water|Solutes such as salts and sugars found in water affect the physical properties of water
Water|water|The boiling and freezing points of water are affected by solutes, as well as air pressure, which is in turn affected by altitude
Water|water|Water boils at lower temperatures with the lower air pressure that occurs at higher elevations
Water|water|One mole of sucrose (sugar) per kilogram of water raises the boiling point of water by 0.51 °C (0.918 °F), and one mole of salt per kg raises the boiling point by 1.02 °C (1.836 °F); similarly, increasing the number of dissolved particles lowers water's freezing point.Solutes in water also affect water activity that affects many chemical reactions and the growth of microbes in food
Water|water|Water activity can be described as a ratio of the vapor pressure of water in a solution to the vapor pressure of pure water
Water|water|Solutes in water lower water activity—this is important to know because most bacterial growth ceases at low levels of water activity
Water|water|Not only does microbial growth affect the safety of food, but also the preservation and shelf life of food.
Water|water|Water hardness is also a critical factor in food processing and may be altered or treated by using a chemical ion exchange system
Water|water|It can dramatically affect the quality of a product, as well as playing a role in sanitation
Water|water|Water hardness is classified based on concentration of calcium carbonate the water contains
Water|water|Water is classified as soft if it contains less than 100 mg/l (UK) or less than 60 mg/l (US).According to a report published by the Water Footprint organization in 2010, a single kilogram of beef requires 15 thousand liters (3.3×10^3 imp gal; 4.0×10^3 U.S
Water|water|gal) of water; however, the authors also make clear that this is a global average and circumstantial factors determine the amount of water used in beef production.
Water|water|Much of the universe's water is produced as a byproduct of star formation
Water|water|The formation of stars is accompanied by a strong outward wind of gas and dust
Water|water|When this outflow of material eventually impacts the surrounding gas, the shock waves that are created compress and heat the gas

Water|water|"According to the researchers, the ""discovery shows that water has been prevalent in the universe for nearly its entire existence"".Water has been detected in interstellar clouds within our galaxy, the Milky Way"
Water|water|Water probably exists in abundance in other galaxies, too, because its components, hydrogen, and oxygen, are among the most abundant elements in the universe

Water|water|Liquid water is present on Earth, covering 71% of its surface
Water|water|Liquid water is also occasionally present in small amounts on Mars
Water|water|Scientists believe liquid water is present in the Saturnian moons of Enceladus, as a 10-kilometre thick ocean approximately 30–40 kilometres below Enceladus' south polar surface, and Titan, as a subsurface layer, possibly mixed with ammonia
Water|water|Jupiter's moon Europa has surface characteristics which suggest a subsurface liquid water ocean

Water|water|The existence of liquid water, and to a lesser extent its gaseous and solid forms, on Earth are vital to the existence of life on Earth as we know it
Water|water|The Earth is located in the habitable zone of the Solar System; if it were slightly closer to or farther from the Sun (about 5%, or about 8 million kilometers), the conditions which allow the three forms to be present simultaneously would be far less likely to exist.Earth's gravity allows it to hold an atmosphere
Water|water|Water vapor and carbon dioxide in the atmosphere provide a temperature buffer (greenhouse effect) which helps maintain a relatively steady surface temperature
Water|water|If Earth were smaller, a thinner atmosphere would allow temperature extremes, thus preventing the accumulation of water except in polar ice caps (as on Mars).The surface temperature of Earth has been relatively constant through geologic time despite varying levels of incoming solar radiation (insolation), indicating that a dynamic process governs Earth's temperature via a combination of greenhouse gases and surface or atmospheric albedo
Water|water|This proposal is known as the Gaia hypothesis.The state of water on a planet depends on ambient pressure, which is determined by the planet's gravity
Water|water|If a planet is sufficiently massive, the water on it may be solid even at high temperatures, because of the high pressure caused by gravity, as it was observed on exoplanets Gliese 436 b and GJ 1214 b.
Water|water|Water politics is politics affected by water and water resources
Water|water|For this reason, water is a strategic resource in the globe and an important element in many political conflicts
Water|water|It causes health impacts and damage to biodiversity.
Water|water|Access to safe drinking water has improved over the last decades in almost every part of the world, but approximately one billion people still lack access to safe water and over 2.5 billion lack access to adequate sanitation
Water|water|However, some observers have estimated that by 2025 more than half of the world population will be facing water-based vulnerability
Water|water|A report, issued in November 2009, suggests that by 2030, in some developing regions of the world, water demand will exceed supply by 50%.1.6 billion people have gained access to a safe water source since 1990
Water|water|"The proportion of people in developing countries with access to safe water is calculated to have improved from 30% in 1970 to 71% in 1990, 79% in 2000 and 84% in 2004.A 2006 United Nations report stated that ""there is enough water for everyone"", but that access to it is hampered by mismanagement and corruption"
Water|water|In addition, global initiatives to improve the efficiency of aid delivery, such as the Paris Declaration on Aid Effectiveness, have not been taken up by water sector donors as effectively as they have in education and health, potentially leaving multiple donors working on overlapping projects and recipient governments without empowerment to act.The authors of the 2007 Comprehensive Assessment of Water Management in Agriculture cited poor governance as one reason for some forms of water scarcity
Water|water|Water governance is the set of formal and informal processes through which decisions related to water management are made
Water|water|Good water governance is primarily about knowing what processes work best in a particular physical and socioeconomic context
Water|water|Mistakes have sometimes been made by trying to apply 'blueprints' that work in the developed world to developing world locations and contexts
Water|water|The Mekong river is one example; a review by the International Water Management Institute of policies in six countries that rely on the Mekong river for water found that thorough and transparent cost-benefit analyses and environmental impact assessments were rarely undertaken
Water|water|They also discovered that Cambodia's draft water law was much more complex than it needed to be.The UN World Water Development Report (WWDR, 2003) from the World Water Assessment Program indicates that, in the next 20 years, the quantity of water available to everyone is predicted to decrease by 30%
Water|water|40% of the world's inhabitants currently have insufficient fresh water for minimal hygiene
Water|water|More than 2.2 million people died in 2000 from waterborne diseases (related to the consumption of contaminated water) or drought
Water|water|In 2004, the UK charity WaterAid reported that a child dies every 15 seconds from easily preventable water-related diseases; often this means lack of sewage disposal.Organizations concerned with water protection include the International Water Association (IWA), WaterAid, Water 1st, and the American Water Resources Association
Water|water|The International Water Management Institute undertakes projects with the aim of using effective water management to reduce poverty
Water|water|Water related conventions are United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification (UNCCD), International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships, United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea and Ramsar Convention
Water|water|World Day for Water takes place on 22 March and World Oceans Day on 8 June.
Water|water|Water is considered a purifier in most religions
Water|water|Faiths that incorporate ritual washing (ablution) include Christianity, Hinduism, Islam, Judaism, the Rastafari movement, Shinto, Taoism, and Wicca
Water|water|Immersion (or aspersion or affusion) of a person in water is a central sacrament of Christianity (where it is called baptism); it is also a part of the practice of other religions, including Islam (Ghusl), Judaism (mikvah) and Sikhism (Amrit Sanskar)
Water|water|In addition, a ritual bath in pure water is performed for the dead in many religions including Islam and Judaism
Water|water|In Islam, the five daily prayers can be done in most cases after washing certain parts of the body using clean water (wudu), unless water is unavailable (see Tayammum)
Water|water|In Shinto, water is used in almost all rituals to cleanse a person or an area (e.g., in the ritual of misogi).
Water|water|The Ancient Greek philosopher Empedocles saw  water as one of the four classical elements (along with fire, earth, and air), and regarded it as an ylem, or basic substance of the universe
Water|water|Thales, whom  Aristotle portrayed as an astronomer and an engineer, theorized that the earth, which is denser than water, emerged from the water
Water|water|Thales, a monist, believed further that all things are made from water
Water|water|Plato believed that the shape of water is an icosahedron - thus explaining why it flows easily compared to the cube-shaped earth.The theory of the four bodily humors associated water with phlegm, as being cold and moist
Water|water|The  classical element of water was also one of the five elements in traditional Chinese philosophy (along with earth, fire, wood, and metal).
Water|water|Some traditional and popular  Asian philosophical systems take water as a role-model
Water|water|"James Legge's 1891 translation of the Dao De Jing states, ""The highest excellence is like (that of) water"
Water|water|The excellence of water appears in its benefiting all things, and in its occupying, without striving (to the contrary), the low place which all men dislike
Water|water|"Hence (its way) is near to (that of) the Tao"" and ""There is nothing in the world more soft and weak than water, and yet for attacking things that are firm and strong there is nothing that can take precedence of it—for there is nothing (so effectual) for which it can be changed."" Guanzi in the ""Shui di"" 水地 chapter further elaborates on the symbolism of water, proclaiming that ""man is water"" and attributing natural qualities of the people of different Chinese regions to the character of local water resources."
Water|water|"""Living water"" features in Germanic and Slavic folktales as a means of bringing the dead back to life"
Water|water|"Note the Grimm fairy-tale (""The Water of Life"") and the Russian dichotomy of living and dead water dead water)"
Water|water|The Fountain of Youth represents a related concept of  magical waters allegedly preventing aging.

Water|water|Water's technically correct but rarely used chemical name, dihydrogen monoxide, has been used in a series of hoaxes and pranks that mock scientific illiteracy
Water|water|This began in 1983, when an April Fools' Day article appeared in a newspaper in Durand, Michigan
Water|water|The false story consisted of safety concerns about the substance.
Water|water|The Water Conflict Chronology
Water|water|Water Conflict Database
Aquaphobia|water|Aquaphobia (from Latin  aqua 'water', and Ancient Greek  φόβος (phóbos) 'fear') is an irrational fear of water.Aquaphobia is considered a Specific Phobia of natural environment type in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders
Aquaphobia|water|A specific phobia is an intense fear of something that poses little or no actual danger.
Aquaphobia|water|"The correct Greek-derived term for ""water-fear"" is hydrophobia, from ὕδωρ (hudōr), ""water"" and φόβος (phobos), ""fear"""
Aquaphobia|water|However, this word has long been used in English to refer specifically to a symptom of later-stage rabies, which manifests itself in humans as difficulty in swallowing, fear when presented with liquids to drink, and an inability to quench one's thirst.
Aquaphobia|water|"A study of epidemiological data from 22 low, lower-middle, upper-middle and high-income countries revealed ""fear of still water or weather events"" had a prevalence of 2.3%, across all countries; in the US the prevalence was 4.3%"
Aquaphobia|water|In an article on anxiety disorders, Lindal and Stefansson suggest that aquaphobia may affect as many as 1.8% of the general Icelandic population, or almost one in fifty people
Aquaphobia|water|In America, 46% of American adults are afraid of deep water in pools and 64% are afraid of deep open waters.
Aquaphobia|water|Specific phobias are a type of anxiety disorder in which a person may feel extremely anxious or has a panic attack when exposed to the object of fear
Aquaphobia|water|Specific phobias are a common mental disorder.Psychologists indicate that aquaphobia manifests itself in people through a combination of experiential and genetic factors
Aquaphobia|water|Five common causes of aquaphobia
Aquaphobia|water|instinctive fear of drowning, experienced an incident of personal horror, has an overprotective parent/parent with aquaphobia, psychological difficulty adjusting to water and lack of trust in water
Aquaphobia|water|"In the case of a 37 year old media professor, he noted that his fear initially presented itself as a, ""severe pain, accompanied by a tightness of his forehead,"" and a choking sensation, discrete panic attacks and a reduction in his intake of fluids."
Aquaphobia|water|Physical Symptoms
Aquaphobia|water|trembling, hot flushes or chills, pain or tightness in chest, butterflies in stomach, feeling faint, dry mouth, ringing in ears, confusion
Aquaphobia|water|Psychological Symptoms
Aquaphobia|water|feeling fear of losing control, fainting, dread and dying.
Aquaphobia|water|Hypnosis and Systematic Desensitization - 28 year old female, aquaphobia from childhood, hypnosis and systematic desensitization in an 8-week 5-session program, 2-month and 1-year follow up

Mpemba effect|water|The Mpemba effect is the name given to the observation that a liquid (typically water) which is initially hot can freeze faster than the same liquid which begins cold, under otherwise similar conditions
Mpemba effect|water|There is disagreement about its theoretical basis and the parameters required to produce the effect.The Mpemba effect is named after Tanzanian schoolboy Erasto Bartholomeo Mpemba (born 1950) whose story of it in 1963 became highly popularized
Mpemba effect|water|The discovery and noted observations of it, however, originate in ancient times, having been said by Aristotle to be common knowledge.
Mpemba effect|water|"The phenomenon, when taken to mean ""hot water freezes faster than cold"", is difficult to reproduce or confirm because this statement is ill-defined"
Mpemba effect|water|Monwhea Jeng proposes a more precise wording:
Mpemba effect|water|"However, even with this definition it is not clear whether ""freezing"" refers to the point at which water forms a visible surface layer of ice, the point at which the entire volume of water becomes a solid block of ice, or when the water reaches 0 °C (32 °F)"
Mpemba effect|water|A quantity of water can be at 0 °C (32 °F) and not be ice; after enough heat has been removed to reach 0 °C (32 °F) more heat must be removed before the water changes to solid state (ice), so water can be liquid or solid at 0 °C (32 °F).
Mpemba effect|water|With the above definition there are simple ways in which the effect might be observed, such as if a warmer temperature melts the frost on a cooling surface and thus increases thermal conductivity between the cooling surface and the water container
Mpemba effect|water|Alternatively, the Mpemba effect may not be evident in situations and under circumstances that may at first seem to qualify for it.
Mpemba effect|water|Various effects of heat on the freezing of water were described by ancient scientists such as Aristotle
Mpemba effect|water|"""The fact that the water has previously been warmed contributes to its freezing quickly"
Mpemba effect|water|for so it cools sooner
Mpemba effect|water|Hence many people, when they want to cool water quickly, begin by putting it in the sun
Mpemba effect|water|"So the inhabitants of Pontus when they encamp on the ice to fish (they cut a hole in the ice and then fish) pour warm water round their reeds that it may freeze the quicker, for they use the ice like lead to fix the reeds."" Aristotle's explanation involved antiperistasis, ""the supposed increase in the intensity of a quality as a result of being surrounded by its contrary quality."""
Mpemba effect|water|The Scottish scientist Joseph Black investigated a special case of this phenomenon comparing previously-boiled with unboiled water; the previously-boiled water froze more quickly
Mpemba effect|water|Evaporation was controlled for
Mpemba effect|water|He discussed the influence of stirring on the results of the experiment, noting that stirring the unboiled water led to it freezing at the same time as the previously-boiled water, and also noted that stirring the very-cold unboiled water led to immediate freezing
Mpemba effect|water|Joseph Black then discussed Fahrenheit's description of supercooling of water (although the term supercooling had not then been coined), arguing, in modern terms, that the previously-boiled water could not be as readily supercooled.
Mpemba effect|water|The effect is named after Tanzanian Erasto Mpemba
Mpemba effect|water|He described it in 1963 in Form 3 of Magamba Secondary School, Tanganyika, when freezing ice cream mix that was hot in cookery classes and noticing that it froze before the cold mix
Mpemba effect|water|He later became a student at Mkwawa Secondary (formerly High) School in Iringa
Mpemba effect|water|The headmaster invited Dr
Mpemba effect|water|Denis Osborne from the University College in Dar es Salaam to give a lecture on physics
Mpemba effect|water|"After the lecture, Mpemba asked him the question, ""If you take two similar containers with equal volumes of water, one at 35 °C (95 °F) and the other at 100 °C (212 °F), and put them into a freezer, the one that started at 100 °C (212 °F) freezes first"
Mpemba effect|water|"Why?"", only to be ridiculed by his classmates and teacher"
Mpemba effect|water|After initial consternation, Osborne experimented on the issue back at his workplace and confirmed Mpemba's finding
Mpemba effect|water|They published the results together in 1969, while Mpemba was studying at the College of African Wildlife Management
Mpemba effect|water|Mpemba and Osborne describe placing 70 ml (2.5 imp fl oz; 2.4 US fl oz) samples of water in 100 ml (3.5 imp fl oz; 3.4 US fl oz) beakers in the icebox of a domestic refrigerator on a sheet of polystyrene foam
Mpemba effect|water|They showed the time for freezing to start was longest with an initial temperature of 25 °C (77 °F) and that it was much less at around 90 °C (194 °F)
Mpemba effect|water|They ruled out loss of liquid volume by evaporation as a significant factor and the effect of dissolved air
Mpemba effect|water|In their setup, most heat loss was found to be from the liquid surface.
Mpemba effect|water|David Auerbach describes an effect that he observed in samples in glass beakers placed into a liquid cooling bath
Mpemba effect|water|In all cases the water supercooled, reaching a temperature of typically −6 to −18 °C (21 to 0 °F) before spontaneously freezing
Mpemba effect|water|Considerable random variation was observed in the time required for spontaneous freezing to start and in some cases this resulted in the water which started off hotter (partially) freezing first.
Mpemba effect|water|In 2016, Burridge and Linden defined the criterion as the time to reach 0 °C (32 °F), carried out experiments and reviewed published work to date
Mpemba effect|water|They noted that the large difference originally claimed had not been replicated, and that studies showing a small effect could be influenced by variations in the positioning of thermometers
Mpemba effect|water|"They say, ""We conclude, somewhat sadly, that there is no evidence to support meaningful observations of the Mpemba effect""."
Mpemba effect|water|In controlled experiments the effect can entirely be explained by undercooling and the time of freezing was determined by what container was used
Mpemba effect|water|"A reviewer for Physics World writes, ""Even if the Mpemba effect is real — if hot water can sometimes freeze more quickly than cold — it is not clear whether the explanation would be trivial or illuminating."" He pointed out that investigations of the phenomenon need to control a large number of initial parameters (including type and initial temperature of the water, dissolved gas and other impurities, and size, shape and material of the container, and temperature of the refrigerator) and need to settle on a particular method of establishing the time of freezing, all of which might affect the presence or absence of the Mpemba effect"
Mpemba effect|water|The required vast multidimensional array of experiments might explain why the effect is not yet understood
Mpemba effect|water|New Scientist recommends starting the experiment with containers at 35 and 5 °C (95 and 41 °F) to maximize the effect
Mpemba effect|water|In a related study, it was found that freezer temperature also affects the probability of observing the Mpemba phenomenon as well as container temperature.
Mpemba effect|water|While the actual occurrence of the Mpemba effect is a matter of controversy, several theoretical explanations could explain its occurrence
Mpemba effect|water|"In 2017, two research groups independently and simultaneously found a theoretical Mpemba effect and also predicted a new ""inverse"" Mpemba effect in which heating a cooled, far-from-equilibrium system takes less time than another system that is initially closer to equilibrium"
Mpemba effect|water|Lu and Raz yield a general criterion based on Markovian statistical mechanics, predicting the appearance of the inverse Mpemba effect in the Ising model and diffusion dynamics
Mpemba effect|water|Lasanta and co-workers predict also the direct and inverse Mpemba effects for a granular gas in a far-from-equilibrium initial state
Mpemba effect|water|In this last work, it is suggested that a very generic mechanism leading to both Mpemba effects is due to a particle velocity distribution function that significantly deviates from the Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution
Mpemba effect|water|James Brownridge, a radiation safety officer at the State University of New York, has said that supercooling is involved
Mpemba effect|water|Several molecular dynamics simulations have also supported that changes in hydrogen bonding during supercooling takes a major role in the process
Mpemba effect|water|Tao and co-workers proposed yet another possible explanation, on the basis of results from vibrational spectroscopy and modelling with density functional theory-optimized water clusters, they suggest that the reason might lie in the vast diversity and peculiar occurrence of different hydrogen bonds
Mpemba effect|water|Their key argument is that the number of strong hydrogen bonds increases as temperature is elevated
Mpemba effect|water|The existence of the small strongly-bonded clusters facilitates in turn the nucleation of hexagonal ice when warm water is rapidly cooled down.
Mpemba effect|water|Microbubble-induced heat transfer
Mpemba effect|water|that the process of boiling induced microbubbles in that water that remain stably suspended as the water cools, then act by convection to transfer heat more quickly as the water cools.
Mpemba effect|water|Evaporation
Mpemba effect|water|The evaporation of the warmer water reduces the mass of the water to be frozen
Mpemba effect|water|Evaporation is endothermic, meaning that the water mass is cooled by vapor carrying away the heat, but this alone probably does not account for the entirety of the effect.
Mpemba effect|water|Convection
Mpemba effect|water|Accelerating heat transfers
Mpemba effect|water|Reduction of water density below 4 °C (39 °F) tends to suppress the convection currents that cool the lower part of the liquid mass; the lower density of hot water would reduce this effect, perhaps sustaining the more rapid initial cooling
Mpemba effect|water|Higher convection in the warmer water may also spread ice crystals around faster.
Mpemba effect|water|Frost
Mpemba effect|water|Has insulating effects
Mpemba effect|water|The lower temperature water will tend to freeze from the top, reducing further heat loss by radiation and air convection, while the warmer water will tend to freeze from the bottom and sides because of water convection
Mpemba effect|water|This is disputed as there are experiments that account for this factor.
Mpemba effect|water|Solutes
Mpemba effect|water|Calcium carbonate, magnesium carbonate and other mineral salts dissolved in water can precipitate out when water is boiled, leading to an increase in the freezing point compared to non-boiled water that contains all the dissolved minerals.
Mpemba effect|water|Thermal conductivity
Mpemba effect|water|The container of hotter liquid may melt through a layer of frost that is acting as an insulator under the container (frost is an insulator, as mentioned above), allowing the container to come into direct contact with a much colder lower layer that the frost formed on (ice, refrigeration coils, etc.) The container now rests on a much colder surface (or one better at removing heat, such as refrigeration coils) than the originally colder water, and so cools far faster from this point on.
Mpemba effect|water|Dissolved gases
Mpemba effect|water|Cold water can contain more dissolved gases than hot water, which may somehow change the properties of the water with respect to convection currents, a proposition that has some experimental support but no theoretical explanation.
Mpemba effect|water|Hydrogen bonding
Mpemba effect|water|In warm water, hydrogen bonding is weaker.
Mpemba effect|water|Crystallization
Mpemba effect|water|Another explanation suggests that the relatively higher population of water hexamer states in warm water might be responsible for the faster crystallization.
Mpemba effect|water|Distribution function
Mpemba effect|water|Strong deviations from the Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution results in potential Mpemba effect showing up in gases.
Mpemba effect|water|Latent heat
Mpemba effect|water|Turning 0 °C (32 °F) ice to 0 °C (32 °F) water takes the same amount of energy as heating water from 0 °C (32 °F) to 80 °C (176 °F);
Mpemba effect|water|Leidenfrost effect
Mpemba effect|water|Lower temperature boilers can sometimes vaporize water faster than higher temperature boilers.

Oral rehydration therapy|water|Oral rehydration therapy (ORT) is a type of fluid replacement used to prevent and treat dehydration, especially due to diarrhea
Oral rehydration therapy|water|It involves drinking water with modest amounts of sugar and salts, specifically sodium and potassium
Oral rehydration therapy|water|Oral rehydration therapy can also be given by a nasogastric tube
Oral rehydration therapy|water|Therapy should routinely include the use of zinc supplements
Oral rehydration therapy|water|Use of oral rehydration therapy has been estimated to decrease the risk of death from diarrhea by up to 93%.Side effects may include vomiting, high blood sodium, or high blood potassium
Oral rehydration therapy|water|If vomiting occurs, it is recommended that use be paused for 10 minutes and then gradually restarted
Oral rehydration therapy|water|The recommended formulation includes sodium chloride, sodium citrate, potassium chloride, and glucose
Oral rehydration therapy|water|Glucose may be replaced by sucrose and sodium citrate may be replaced by sodium bicarbonate, if not available
Oral rehydration therapy|water|It works as glucose increases the uptake of sodium and thus water by the intestines
Oral rehydration therapy|water|A number of other formulations are also available including versions that can be made at home
Oral rehydration therapy|water|However, the use of homemade solutions has not been well studied.Oral rehydration therapy was developed in the 1940s, but did not come into common use until the 1970s
Oral rehydration therapy|water|It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines
Oral rehydration therapy|water|Globally, as of 2015, oral rehydration therapy is used by 41% of children with diarrhea
Oral rehydration therapy|water|This use has played an important role in reducing the number of deaths in children under the age of five.
Oral rehydration therapy|water|ORT is less invasive than the other strategies for fluid replacement, specifically intravenous (IV) fluid replacement
Oral rehydration therapy|water|Mild to moderate dehydration in children seen in an emergency department is best treated with ORT
Oral rehydration therapy|water|Persons taking ORT should eat within six hours and return to their full diet within 24–48 hours.Oral rehydration therapy may also be used as a treatment for the symptoms of dehydration and rehydration in burns in resource-limited settings.
Oral rehydration therapy|water|ORT may lower the mortality rate of diarrhea by as much as 93%
Oral rehydration therapy|water|Case studies in 4 developing countries also have demonstrated an association between increased use of ORS and reduction in mortality.
Oral rehydration therapy|water|The degree of dehydration should be assessed before initiating ORT
Oral rehydration therapy|water|ORT is suitable for people who are not dehydrated and those who show signs and symptoms of mild to moderate dehydration
Oral rehydration therapy|water|People who have severe dehydration should seek professional medical help immediately and receive intravenous rehydration as soon as possible to rapidly replenish fluid volume in the body.
Oral rehydration therapy|water|ORT should be discontinued and fluids replaced intravenously when vomiting is protracted despite proper administration of ORT, signs of dehydration worsen despite giving ORT, the person is unable to drink due to a decreased level of consciousness, or there is evidence of intestinal blockage or ileus
Oral rehydration therapy|water|ORT might also be contraindicated in people who are in hemodynamic shock due to impaired airway protective reflexes
Oral rehydration therapy|water|Short-term vomiting is not a contraindication to receiving oral rehydration therapy
Oral rehydration therapy|water|In persons who are vomiting, drinking oral rehydration solution at a slow and continuous pace will help resolve vomiting.
Oral rehydration therapy|water|WHO and UNICEF jointly have developed official guidelines for the manufacture of oral rehydration solution and the oral rehydration salts used to make it (both often abbreviated as ORS)
Oral rehydration therapy|water|They also describe acceptable alternative preparations, depending on material availability
Oral rehydration therapy|water|Commercial preparations are available as either prepared fluids or packets of oral rehydration salts ready for mixing with water.A basic oral rehydration therapy solution can also be prepared when packets of oral rehydration salts are not available
Oral rehydration therapy|water|The molar ratio of sugar to salt should be 1:1 and the solution should not be hyperosmolar
Oral rehydration therapy|water|"The Rehydration Project states, ""Making the mixture a little diluted (with more than 1 litre of clean water) is not harmful.""The optimal fluid for preparing oral rehydration solution is clean water"
Oral rehydration therapy|water|However, if this is not available, the usually available water should be used
Oral rehydration therapy|water|Oral rehydration solution should not  be withheld simply because the available water is potentially unsafe; rehydration takes precedence.When oral rehydration salts packets and suitable teaspoons for measuring sugar and salt are not available, the WHO has recommended that homemade gruels, soups, etc., may be considered to help maintain hydration
Oral rehydration therapy|water|A Lancet review in 2013 emphasized the need for more research on appropriate home made fluids to prevent dehydration
Oral rehydration therapy|water|Sports drinks are not optimal oral rehydration solutions, but they can be used if optimal choices are not available
Oral rehydration therapy|water|They should not be withheld for lack of better options; again, rehydration takes precedence
Oral rehydration therapy|water|But they are not replacements for oral rehydration solutions in nonemergency situations.
Oral rehydration therapy|water|In 2003, WHO and UNICEF recommended that the osmolarity of oral rehydration solution be reduced from 311 to 245 mOsm/L 
Oral rehydration therapy|water|These guidelines were also updated in 2006
Oral rehydration therapy|water|This recommendation was based on multiple clinical trials showing that the reduced osmolarity solution reduces stool volume in children with diarrhea by about twenty-five percent and the need for IV therapy by about thirty percent when compared to standard oral rehydration solution
Oral rehydration therapy|water|The incidence of vomiting is also reduced
Oral rehydration therapy|water|The reduced osmolarity oral rehydration solution has lower concentrations of glucose and sodium chloride than the original solution, but the concentrations of potassium and citrate are unchanged.The reduced osmolarity solution has been criticized by some for not providing enough sodium for adults with cholera
Oral rehydration therapy|water|Clinical trials have, however, shown reduced osmolarity solution to be effective for adults and children with cholera
Oral rehydration therapy|water|They seem to be safe but some caution is warranted according to the Cochrane review.
Oral rehydration therapy|water|ORT is based on evidence that water continues to be absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract even while fluid is lost through diarrhea or vomiting
Oral rehydration therapy|water|The World Health Organization specify indications, preparations and procedures for ORT.WHO/UNICEF guidelines suggest ORT should begin at the first sign of diarrhea in order to prevent dehydration
Oral rehydration therapy|water|Babies may be given ORS with a dropper or a syringe
Oral rehydration therapy|water|Infants under two may be given a teaspoon of ORS fluid every one to two minutes
Oral rehydration therapy|water|Older children and adults should take frequent sips from a cup, with a recommended intake of 200-400 ml of solution after every loose movement
Oral rehydration therapy|water|The WHO recommends giving children under two a quarter- to a half-cup of fluid following each loose bowel movement and older children a half- to a full cup
Oral rehydration therapy|water|If the person vomits, the caretaker should wait 5–10 minutes and then resume giving ORS.
Oral rehydration therapy|water|Section 4.2  ORS may be given by aid workers or health care workers in refugee camps, health clinics and hospital settings
Oral rehydration therapy|water|Mothers should remain with their children and be taught how to give ORS
Oral rehydration therapy|water|This will help to prepare them to give ORT at home in the future
Oral rehydration therapy|water|Breastfeeding should be continued throughout ORT.
Oral rehydration therapy|water|As part of oral rehydration therapy, the WHO recommends supplemental zinc (10 to 20 mg daily) for ten to fourteen days, to reduce the severity and duration of the illness and make recurrent illness in the following two to three months less likely
Oral rehydration therapy|water|Preparations are available as a zinc sulfate solution for adults, a modified solution for children and in tablet form.
Oral rehydration therapy|water|After severe dehydration is corrected and appetite returns, feeding the person speeds the recovery of normal intestinal function, minimizes weight loss and supports continued growth in children
Oral rehydration therapy|water|Small frequent meals are best tolerated (offering the child food every three to four hours)
Oral rehydration therapy|water|Mothers should continue to breastfeed
Oral rehydration therapy|water|A child with watery diarrhea typically regains his or her appetite as soon as dehydration is corrected, whereas a child with bloody diarrhea often eats poorly until the illness resolves
Oral rehydration therapy|water|Such children should be encouraged to resume normal feeding as soon as possible
Oral rehydration therapy|water|Once diarrhea is corrected, the WHO recommends giving the child an extra meal each day for two weeks, and longer if the child is malnourished.
Oral rehydration therapy|water|Dehydration may be overestimated in wasted children and underestimated in edematous children
Oral rehydration therapy|water|Care of these children must also include careful management of their malnutrition and treatment of other infections
Oral rehydration therapy|water|Useful signs of dehydration include an eagerness to drink, lethargy, cool and moist extremities, weak or absent radial pulse (wrist), and reduced or absent urine flow
Oral rehydration therapy|water|In children with severe malnutrition, it is often impossible to reliably distinguish between moderate and severe dehydration
Oral rehydration therapy|water|A severely malnourished child who has signs of severe dehydration but who does not have a history of watery diarrhea should be treated for septic shock.The original ORS (90 mmol sodium/L) and the current standard reduced-osmolarity ORS (75 mmol sodium/L) both contain too much sodium and too little potassium for severely malnourished children with dehydration due to diarrhea
Oral rehydration therapy|water|ReSoMal (Rehydration Solution for Malnutrition) is recommended for such children
Oral rehydration therapy|water|It contains less sodium (45 mmol/l) and more potassium (40 mmol/l) than reduced osmolarity ORS
Oral rehydration therapy|water|It can be obtained in packets produced by UNICEF or other manufacturers
Oral rehydration therapy|water|An exception is if the severely malnourished child also has severe diarrhea (in which case ReSoMal may not provide enough sodium), in which case standard reduced-osmolarity ORS (75 mmol sodium/L) is recommended
Oral rehydration therapy|water|Malnourished children should be rehydrated slowly
Oral rehydration therapy|water|The WHO recommends 10 milliliters of ReSoMal per kilogram body weight for each of the first two hours (for example, a 9-kilogram child should be given 90 ml of ReSoMal over the course of the first hour, and another 90 ml for the second hour) and then continuing at this same rate or slower based on the child's thirst and ongoing stool losses, keeping in mind that a severely dehydrated child may be lethargic
Oral rehydration therapy|water|If the child drinks poorly, a nasogastric tube should be used
Oral rehydration therapy|water|The IV route should not be used for rehydration except in cases of shock and then only with care, infusing slowly to avoid flooding the circulation and overloading the heart.Feeding should usually resume within 2–3 hours after starting rehydration and should continue every 2–3 hours, day and night
Oral rehydration therapy|water|For an initial cereal diet before a child regains his or her full appetite, the WHO recommends combining 25 grams skimmed milk powder, 20 grams vegetable oil, 60 grams sugar, and 60 grams rice powder or other cereal into 1,000 milliliters water and boiling gently for five minutes
Oral rehydration therapy|water|Give 130 ml per kilogram of body weight during per 24 hours
Oral rehydration therapy|water|A child who cannot or will not eat this minimum amount should be given the diet by nasogastric tube divided into six equal feedings
Oral rehydration therapy|water|Later on, the child should be given cereal made with a greater amount of skimmed milk product and vegetable oil and slightly less sugar
Oral rehydration therapy|water|As appetite fully returns, the child should be eating 200 ml per kilogram of body weight per day
Oral rehydration therapy|water|Zinc, potassium, vitamin A, and other vitamins and minerals should be added to both recommended cereal products, or to the oral rehydration solution itself
Oral rehydration therapy|water|Children who are breastfed should continue breastfeeding.
Oral rehydration therapy|water|The WHO recommends that all severely malnourished children admitted to hospital should receive broad-spectrum antibiotics (for example, gentamicin and ampicillin)
Oral rehydration therapy|water|In addition, hospitalized children should be checked daily for other specific infections.If cholera is suspected give an antibiotic to which V
Oral rehydration therapy|water|cholerae are susceptible
Oral rehydration therapy|water|This reduces the volume loss due to diarrhea by 50% and shortens the duration of diarrhea to about 48 hours.
Oral rehydration therapy|water|Fluid from the body enters the intestinal lumen during digestion
Oral rehydration therapy|water|This fluid is isosmotic with the blood and contains a high quantity, about 142 mEq/L, of sodium
Oral rehydration therapy|water|A healthy individual secretes 2000–3000 milligrams of sodium per day into the intestinal lumen
Oral rehydration therapy|water|Nearly all of this is reabsorbed so that sodium levels in the body remain constant
Oral rehydration therapy|water|In a diarrheal illness, sodium-rich intestinal secretions are lost before they can be reabsorbed
Oral rehydration therapy|water|This can lead to life-threatening dehydration or electrolyte imbalances within hours when fluid loss is severe
Oral rehydration therapy|water|The objective of therapy is the replenishment of sodium and water losses by ORT or intravenous infusion.Sodium absorption occurs in two stages
Oral rehydration therapy|water|The first is via intestinal epithelial cells (enterocytes)
Oral rehydration therapy|water|Sodium passes into these cells by co-transport with glucose, via the SGLT1 protein
Oral rehydration therapy|water|From the intestinal epithelial cells, sodium is pumped by active transport via the sodium-potassium pump through the basolateral cell membrane into the extracellular space.The sodium–potassium ATPase pump at the basolateral cell membrane moves three sodium ions into the extracellular space, while pulling into the enterocyte two potassium ions
Oral rehydration therapy|water|"This creates a ""downhill"" sodium gradient within the cell"
Oral rehydration therapy|water|SGLT proteins use energy from this downhill sodium gradient to transport glucose across the apical membrane of the cell against the glucose gradient
Oral rehydration therapy|water|The co-transporters are examples of secondary active transport
Oral rehydration therapy|water|The GLUT uniporters then transport glucose across the basolateral membrane
Oral rehydration therapy|water|Both SGLT1 and SGLT2 are known as symporters, since both sodium and glucose are transported in the same direction across the membrane.
Oral rehydration therapy|water|The co-transport of glucose into epithelial cells via the SGLT1 protein requires sodium
Oral rehydration therapy|water|Two sodium ions and one molecule of glucose (or galactose) are transported together across the cell membrane via the SGLT1 protein
Oral rehydration therapy|water|Without glucose, intestinal sodium is not absorbed
Oral rehydration therapy|water|This is why oral rehydration salts include both sodium and glucose
Oral rehydration therapy|water|For each cycle of the transport, hundreds of water molecules move into the epithelial cell to maintain osmotic equilibrium
Oral rehydration therapy|water|The resultant absorption of sodium and water can achieve rehydration even while diarrhea continues.
Oral rehydration therapy|water|"In the early 1980s, ""oral rehydration therapy"" referred only to the preparation prescribed by the World Health Organization (WHO) and UNICEF"
Oral rehydration therapy|water|In 1988, the definition changed to encompass recommended home-made solutions, because the official preparation was not always readily available
Oral rehydration therapy|water|The definition was again amended in 1988 to include continued feeding as an appropriate associated therapy
Oral rehydration therapy|water|"In 1991, the definition became, ""an increase in administered hydrational fluids"" and in 1993, ""an increase in administered fluids and continued feeding""."
Oral rehydration therapy|water|Until 1960, ORT was not known in the West
Oral rehydration therapy|water|Dehydration was a major cause of death during the 1829 cholera pandemic in Russia and Western Europe
Oral rehydration therapy|water|In 1831, William Brooke O'Shaughnessy noted the loss of water and salt in the stool of people with cholera and prescribed intravenous fluid therapy (IV fluids)
Oral rehydration therapy|water|The prescribing of hypertonic IV therapy decreased the mortality rate of cholera from 70 to 40 percent
Oral rehydration therapy|water|"In the West, IV therapy became the ""gold standard"" for the treatment of moderate and severe dehydration.In 1953 Indian physician Hemendra Nath Chatterjee published his results in The Lancet of treating people with cholera with ORT"
Oral rehydration therapy|water|He was the first to formulate and demonstrate the effectiveness of ORS for diarrhea
Oral rehydration therapy|water|The formulation of the fluid replacement solution  was 4 g of sodium chloride, 25 g of glucose and 1000 ml of water.Robert A
Oral rehydration therapy|water|Phillips attempted to create an effective ORT solution based on his discovery that, in the presence of glucose, sodium and chloride could be absorbed in patients with cholera
Oral rehydration therapy|water|However, Phillips' efforts failed because the solution he used was excessively hypertonic.In the early 1960s, biochemist Robert K
Oral rehydration therapy|water|Crane described the sodium-glucose co-transport mechanism and its role in intestinal glucose absorption
Oral rehydration therapy|water|This, combined with evidence that the intestinal mucosa appears undamaged in cholera, suggested that intestinal absorption of glucose and sodium might continue during the illness
Oral rehydration therapy|water|This supported the notion that oral rehydration might be possible even during severe diarrhea due to cholera
Oral rehydration therapy|water|In 1967–1968, Norbert Hirschhorn and Nathaniel F
Oral rehydration therapy|water|Pierce, working in Dhaka, Bangladesh and Calcutta, India, respectively, showed that people with severe cholera can absorb glucose, salt and water and that this can occur in sufficient amounts to maintain hydration
Oral rehydration therapy|water|In 1968, David R
Oral rehydration therapy|water|Nalin and Richard A
Oral rehydration therapy|water|Cash reported that in adults with cholera, given an oral glucose-electrolyte solution in volumes equal to that of the diarrhea losses, reduced the need for IV fluid therapy by eighty percent.Rafiqul Islam (c
Oral rehydration therapy|water|1936 – 5 March 2018) was a Bangladeshi physician and medical scientist
Oral rehydration therapy|water|He is known for the discovery of food saline (Orosaline) for the treatment of diarrhea
Oral rehydration therapy|water|In 1971, fighting during the Bangladesh Liberation War displaced millions and an epidemic of cholera ensued among the refugees
Oral rehydration therapy|water|When IV fluid ran out in the refugee camps, Rafiqul Islam and Dilip Mahalanabis, a physician working with the Johns Hopkins International Center for Medical Research and Training in Calcutta, instructed to prepare and distribute an oral rehydration solution prepared from individual ingredients to family members and caregivers
Oral rehydration therapy|water|Over 3,000 people with cholera received ORT in this way
Oral rehydration therapy|water|The mortality rate was 3.6 percent among those given ORT compared with 30 percent in those given IV fluid therapy
Oral rehydration therapy|water|"It was also known as ""Dhaka Saline"""
Oral rehydration therapy|water|After the independence of Bangladesh, a wide circulation campaign was conducted on the use of saline in the treatment of diarrhea
Oral rehydration therapy|water|In the year 1980, the World Health Organization recognized Orosaline.
Oral rehydration therapy|water|In the early 1970s, Norbert Hirschhorn used oral rehydration therapy on the White River Apache Indian Reservation with a grant from the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases
Oral rehydration therapy|water|He made the important observation that children would voluntarily drink as much of the solution as needed to restore hydration, and that rehydration and early re-feeding would protect their nutrition
Oral rehydration therapy|water|This led to increased use of ORT for children with diarrhea, especially in developing countries.
Oral rehydration therapy|water|In 1980 the Bangladeshi nonprofit BRAC created a door-to-door and person-to-person sales force to teach ORT for use by mothers at home
Oral rehydration therapy|water|A task force of fourteen women, one cook and one male supervisor traveled from village to village
Oral rehydration therapy|water|After visiting with women in several villages, they hit upon the idea of encouraging the women in the village to make their own oral rehydration fluid
Oral rehydration therapy|water|"They used available household equipment, starting with a ""half a seer"" (half a quart) of water and adding a fistful of sugar and a three-finger pinch of salt"
Oral rehydration therapy|water|Later on, the approach was broadcast over television and radio and a market for oral rehydration salts packets developed
Oral rehydration therapy|water|"Three decades later, national surveys have found that almost 90% of children with severe diarrhea in Bangladesh are given oral rehydration fluids at home or in a health facility.From 2006 to 2011, UNICEF estimated that worldwide about a third of children under 5 who had diarrhea received an oral rehydration solution, with estimates ranging from 30% to 41% depending on the region.ORT is one of the principal elements of the UNICEF ""GOBI FFF"" program (growth monitoring; ORT; breast feeding; immunization; female education; family spacing and food supplementation)"
Oral rehydration therapy|water|The program aims to increase child survival in developing nations through proven low-cost interventions.
Oral rehydration therapy|water|People had fled from civil war in Mozambique to southern Malawi
Oral rehydration therapy|water|In November 1990, cholera broke out in a refugee camp in southern Malawi where approximately 74,000 persons were temporarily living
Oral rehydration therapy|water|David Swerdlow of the U.S.'s CDC Epidemic Intelligence Service (EIS) wrote about the situation
Oral rehydration therapy|water|He recommended setting up a tent just for children who would be assisted by some of the best nurses
Oral rehydration therapy|water|He recommended against over-reliance on IV tubes, which often were left attached to persons for a week or more and which could lead to infections and septic shock
Oral rehydration therapy|water|And he noticed that sick persons were not drinking enough rehydration solution
Oral rehydration therapy|water|"He assigned so-called ""ORS officers"" whose job was to encourage persons to drink more solution."
Oral rehydration therapy|water|It was a minor mystery how persons were getting sick since deep-bore wells provided clean water and refugees were encouraged to wash their hands
Oral rehydration therapy|water|It was then discovered that the only place for persons to wash hands were in the same buckets in which water was transported and stored
Oral rehydration therapy|water|"Swerdlow wrote in his report, ""Use of narrow mouthed water containers would probably decrease the likelihood of contamination."""

Outline of water|water|The Water Conflict Chronology
Outline of water|water|Water Conflict Database
Thirst|water|Thirst is the craving for potable fluids, resulting in the basic instinct of animals to drink
Thirst|water|It is an essential mechanism involved in fluid balance
Thirst|water|It arises from a lack of fluids or an increase in the concentration of certain osmolites, such as sodium
Thirst|water|If the water volume of the body falls below a certain threshold or the osmolite concentration becomes too high, structures in the brain detect changes in blood constituents and signal thirst.Continuous dehydration can cause acute and chronic diseases, but is most often associated with renal and neurological disorders
Thirst|water|Excessive thirst, called polydipsia, along with excessive urination, known as polyuria, may be an indication of diabetes mellitus or diabetes insipidus.
Thirst|water|There are receptors and other systems in the body that detect a decreased volume or an increased osmolite concentration
Thirst|water|"Some sources distinguish ""extracellular thirst"" from ""intracellular thirst"", where extracellular thirst is thirst generated by decreased volume and intracellular thirst is thirst generated by increased osmolite concentration."
Thirst|water|It is vital for organisms to be able to maintain their fluid levels in very narrow ranges
Thirst|water|The goal is to keep the interstitial fluid, the fluid outside the cell, at the same concentration as the intracellular fluid, the fluid inside the cell
Thirst|water|This condition is called isotonic and occurs when the same levels of solutes are present on either side of the cell membrane so that the net water movement is zero
Thirst|water|If the interstitial fluid has a higher concentration of solutes (or a lower concentration of water) than the intracellular fluid, it will pull water out of the cell
Thirst|water|This condition is called hypertonic and if enough water leaves the cell, it will not be able to perform essential chemical functions
Thirst|water|The animal will then become thirsty in response to the demand for water in the cell
Thirst|water|After the animal drinks water, the interstitial fluid becomes less concentrated of solutes (more concentrated of water) than the intracellular fluid and the cell will fill with water as it tries to equalize the concentrations
Thirst|water|This condition is called hypotonic and can be dangerous because it can cause the cell to swell and rupture
Thirst|water|One set of receptors responsible for thirst detects the concentration of interstitial fluid
Thirst|water|The other set of receptors detects blood volume.
Thirst|water|This is one of two types of thirst and is defined as thirst caused by loss of blood volume (hypovolemia) without depleting the intracellular fluid
Thirst|water|This can be caused by blood loss, vomiting, and diarrhea
Thirst|water|This loss of volume is problematic because if the total blood volume falls too low the heart cannot circulate blood effectively and the eventual result is hypovolemic shock
Thirst|water|The vascular system responds by constricting blood vessels thereby creating a smaller volume for the blood to fill
Thirst|water|This mechanical solution, however, has definite limits and usually must be supplemented with increased volume
Thirst|water|The loss of blood volume is detected by cells in the kidneys and triggers thirst for both water and salt via the renin-angiotensin system.
Thirst|water|Hypovolemia leads to activation of the renin angiotensin system (RAS) and is detected by cells in the kidney
Thirst|water|When these cells detect decreased blood flow due to the low volume they secrete an enzyme called renin
Thirst|water|Renin then enters the blood where it catalyzes a protein called angiotensinogen to angiotensin I
Thirst|water|Angiotensin I is then almost immediately converted by an enzyme already present in the blood to the active form of the protein, angiotensin II
Thirst|water|Angiotensin II then travels in the blood until it reaches the posterior pituitary gland and the adrenal cortex, where it causes a cascade effect of hormones that cause the kidneys to retain water and sodium, increasing blood pressure
Thirst|water|It is also responsible for the initiation of drinking behavior and salt appetite via the subfornical organ.
Thirst|water|Osmometric thirst occurs when the solute concentration of the interstitial fluid increases
Thirst|water|This increase draws water out of the cells, and they shrink in volume
Thirst|water|The solute concentration of the interstitial fluid increases by high intake of sodium in diet or by the drop in volume of extracellular fluids (such as blood plasma and cerebrospinal fluid) due to loss of water through perspiration, respiration, urination and defecation
Thirst|water|The increase in interstitial fluid solute concentration causes water to migrate from the cells of the body, through their membranes, to the extracellular compartment, by osmosis, thus causing cellular dehydration.Clusters of cells (osmoreceptors) in the organum vasculosum of the lamina terminalis (OVLT) and subfornical organ (SFO), which lie outside of the blood brain barrier can detect the concentration of blood plasma and the presence of angiotensin II in the blood
Thirst|water|They can then activate the median preoptic nucleus which initiates water seeking and ingestive behavior
Thirst|water|Destruction of this part of the hypothalamus in humans and other animals results in partial or total loss of desire to drink even with extremely high salt concentration in the extracellular fluids
Thirst|water|In addition, there are visceral osmoreceptors which project to the area postrema and nucleus tractus solitarii in the brain.
Thirst|water|Because sodium is also lost from the plasma in hypovolemia, the body's need for salt proportionately increases in addition to thirst in such cases
Thirst|water|This is also a result of the renin-angiotensin system activation.
Thirst|water|In adults over the age of 50 years, the body's thirst sensation reduces and continues diminishing with age, putting this population at increased risk of dehydration
Thirst|water|Several studies have demonstrated that elderly persons have lower total water intakes than younger adults, and that women are particularly at risk of too low an intake.
Thirst|water|In 2009, the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) included water as a macronutrient in its dietary reference values for the first time
Thirst|water|Recommended intake volumes in the elderly are the same as for younger adults (2.0 L/day for females and 2.5 L/day for males) as despite lower energy consumption, the water requirement of this group is increased due to a reduction in renal concentrating capacity.
Thirst|water|According to preliminary research, quenching of thirst – the homeostatic mechanism to stop drinking – occurs via two neural phases
Thirst|water|"a ""preabsorptive"" phase which signals quenched thirst many minutes before fluid is absorbed from the stomach and distributed to the body via the circulation, and a ""postabsorptive"" phase which is regulated by brain structures sensing  to terminate fluid ingestion"
Thirst|water|The preabsorptive phase relies on sensory inputs in the mouth, pharynx, esophagus, and upper gastrointestinal tract to anticipate the amount of fluid needed, providing rapid signals to the brain to terminate drinking when the assessed amount has been consumed
Thirst|water|The postabsorptive phase occurs via blood monitoring for osmolality, fluid volume, and sodium balance, which are collectively sensed in brain circumventricular organs linked via neural networks to terminate thirst when fluid balance is established.Thirst quenching varies among animal species, with dogs, camels, sheep, goats, and deer replacing fluid deficits quickly when water is available, whereas humans and horses may need hours to restore fluid balance.
Thirst|water|The areas of the brain that contribute to the sense of thirst are mainly located in the midbrain and the hindbrain
Thirst|water|Specifically, the hypothalamus appears to play a key role in the regulation of thirst.
Thirst|water|The area postrema and nucleus tractus solitarii signal to the subfornical organ and to the lateral parabrachial nucleus
Thirst|water|The latter signaling relies on the neurotransmitter serotonin
Thirst|water|The signal from the lateral parabrachial nucleus is relayed to the median preoptic nucleus.The median preoptic nucleus and the subfornical organ receive signals of decreased volume and increased osmolite concentration
Thirst|water|Finally, the signals are received in cortex areas of the forebrain where thirst arises
Thirst|water|The subfornical organ and the organum vasculosum of the lamina terminalis contribute to regulating the overall bodily fluid balance by signalling to the hypothalamus to form vasopressin, which is later released by the pituitary gland.

Water (data page)|water|In the following tables, values are temperature-dependent and to a lesser degree pressure-dependent, and are arranged by state of aggregation (s = solid, lq = liquid, g = gas), which are clearly a function of temperature and pressure

Water pinch analysis|water|Water pinch analysis (WPA) originates from the concept of heat pinch analysis
Water pinch analysis|water|WPA is a systematic technique for reducing water consumption and wastewater generation through integration of water-using activities or processes
Water pinch analysis|water|WPA was first introduced by Wang and Smith
Water pinch analysis|water|Since then, it has been widely used as a tool for water conservation in industrial process plants
Water pinch analysis|water|Water Pinch Analysis has recently been applied for urban/domestic buildings
Water pinch analysis|water|It was extended in 1998 by Nick Hallale at the University of Cape Town, who developed it as a special case of mass exchange networks for capital cost targeting.
Water pinch analysis|water|Techniques for setting targets for maximum water recovery capable of handling any type of water-using operation including mass-transfer-based and non-mass-transfer based systems include the source and sink composite curves (Nick Hallale (2002)

Fire|fire|Fire is hot because the conversion of the weak double bond in molecular oxygen, O2, to the stronger bonds in the combustion products carbon dioxide and water releases energy (418 kJ per 32 g of O2); the bond energies of the fuel play only a minor role here
Fire|fire|At a certain point in the combustion reaction, called the ignition point, flames are produced
Fire|fire|The flame is the visible portion of the fire
Fire|fire|Flames consist primarily of carbon dioxide, water vapor, oxygen and nitrogen
Fire|fire|If hot enough, the gases may become ionized to produce plasma
Fire|fire|Depending on the substances alight, and any impurities outside, the color of the flame and the fire's intensity will be different.
Fire|fire|Fire in its most common form can result in conflagration, which has the potential to cause physical damage through burning
Fire|fire|Fire is an important process that affects ecological systems around the globe
Fire|fire|The positive effects of fire include stimulating growth and maintaining various ecological systems.
Fire|fire|Its negative effects include hazard to life and property, atmospheric pollution, and water contamination
Fire|fire|If fire removes protective vegetation, heavy rainfall may lead to an increase in soil erosion by water
Fire|fire|Also, when vegetation is burned, the nitrogen it contains is released into the atmosphere, unlike elements such as potassium and phosphorus which remain in the ash and are quickly recycled into the soil
Fire|fire|"This loss of nitrogen caused by a fire produces a long-term reduction in the fertility of the soil, but this fecundity can potentially be recovered as molecular nitrogen in the atmosphere is ""fixed"" and converted to ammonia by natural phenomena such as lightning and by leguminous plants that are ""nitrogen-fixing"" such as clover, peas, and green beans."
Fire|fire|Fires start when a flammable or a combustible material, in combination with a sufficient quantity of an oxidizer such as oxygen gas or another oxygen-rich compound (though non-oxygen oxidizers exist), is exposed to a source of heat or ambient temperature above the flash point for the fuel/oxidizer mix, and is able to sustain a rate of rapid oxidation that produces a chain reaction
Fire|fire|This is commonly called the fire tetrahedron
Fire|fire|Fire cannot exist without all of these elements in place and in the right proportions
Fire|fire|For example, a flammable liquid will start burning only if the fuel and oxygen are in the right proportions
Fire|fire|Some fuel-oxygen mixes may require a catalyst, a substance that is not consumed, when added, in any chemical reaction during combustion, but which enables the reactants to combust more readily.
Fire|fire|If the oxidizer is oxygen from the surrounding air, the presence of a force of gravity, or of some similar force caused by acceleration, is necessary to produce convection, which removes combustion products and brings a supply of oxygen to the fire
Fire|fire|Without gravity, a fire rapidly surrounds itself with its own combustion products and non-oxidizing gases from the air, which exclude oxygen and extinguish the fire
Fire|fire|Because of this, the risk of fire in a spacecraft is small when it is coasting in inertial flight
Fire|fire|This does not apply if oxygen is supplied to the fire by some process other than thermal convection.
Fire|fire|Fire can be extinguished by removing any one of the elements of the fire tetrahedron
Fire|fire|Consider a natural gas flame, such as from a stove-top burner
Fire|fire|The fire can be extinguished by any of the following:
Fire|fire|application of a retardant chemical such as Halon to the flame, which retards the chemical reaction itself until the rate of combustion is too slow to maintain the chain reaction.In contrast, fire is intensified by increasing the overall rate of combustion
Fire|fire|Methods to do this include balancing the input of fuel and oxidizer to stoichiometric proportions, increasing fuel and oxidizer input in this balanced mix, increasing the ambient temperature so the fire's own heat is better able to sustain combustion, or providing a catalyst, a non-reactant medium in which the fuel and oxidizer can more readily react.
Fire|fire|A flame is a mixture of reacting gases and solids emitting visible, infrared, and sometimes ultraviolet light, the frequency spectrum of which depends on the chemical composition of the burning material and intermediate reaction products
Fire|fire|"In many cases, such as the burning of organic matter, for example wood, or the incomplete combustion of gas, incandescent solid particles called soot produce the familiar red-orange glow of ""fire"""
Fire|fire|This light has a continuous spectrum
Fire|fire|Complete combustion of gas has a dim blue color due to the emission of single-wavelength radiation from various electron transitions in the excited molecules formed in the flame
Fire|fire|Usually oxygen is involved, but hydrogen burning in chlorine also produces a flame, producing hydrogen chloride (HCl)
Fire|fire|Other possible combinations producing flames, amongst many, are fluorine and hydrogen, and hydrazine and nitrogen tetroxide
Fire|fire|"Hydrogen and hydrazine/UDMH flames are similarly pale blue, while burning boron and its compounds, evaluated in mid-20th century as a high energy fuel for jet and rocket engines, emits intense green flame, leading to its informal nickname of ""Green Dragon""."
Fire|fire|The glow of a flame is complex
Fire|fire|Black-body radiation is emitted from soot, gas, and fuel particles, though the soot particles are too small to behave like perfect blackbodies
Fire|fire|There is also photon emission by de-excited atoms and molecules in the gases
Fire|fire|Much of the radiation is emitted in the visible and infrared bands
Fire|fire|The color depends on temperature for the black-body radiation, and on chemical makeup for the emission spectra
Fire|fire|The dominant color in a flame changes with temperature
Fire|fire|The photo of the forest fire in Canada is an excellent example of this variation
Fire|fire|Near the ground, where most burning is occurring, the fire is white, the hottest color possible for organic material in general, or yellow
Fire|fire|Above the yellow region, the color changes to orange, which is cooler, then red, which is cooler still
Fire|fire|Above the red region, combustion no longer occurs, and the uncombusted carbon particles are visible as black smoke.
Fire|fire|The common distribution of a flame under normal gravity conditions depends on convection, as soot tends to rise to the top of a general flame, as in a candle in normal gravity conditions, making it yellow
Fire|fire|In micro gravity or zero gravity, such as an environment in outer space, convection no longer occurs, and the flame becomes spherical, with a tendency to become more blue and more efficient (although it may go out if not moved steadily, as the CO2 from combustion does not disperse as readily in micro gravity, and tends to smother the flame)
Fire|fire|There are several possible explanations for this difference, of which the most likely is that the temperature is sufficiently evenly distributed that soot is not formed and complete combustion occurs
Fire|fire|Experiments by NASA reveal that diffusion flames in micro gravity allow more soot to be completely oxidized after they are produced than diffusion flames on Earth, because of a series of mechanisms that behave differently in micro gravity when compared to normal gravity conditions
Fire|fire|These discoveries have potential applications in applied science and industry, especially concerning fuel efficiency.
Fire|fire|In combustion engines, various steps are taken to eliminate a flame
Fire|fire|The method depends mainly on whether the fuel is oil, wood, or a high-energy fuel such as jet fuel.
Fire|fire|Every natural ecosystem has its own fire regime, and the organisms in those ecosystems are adapted to or dependent upon that fire regime
Fire|fire|Fire creates a mosaic of different habitat patches, each at a different stage of succession
Fire|fire|Different species of plants, animals, and microbes specialize in exploiting a particular stage, and by creating these different types of patches, fire allows a greater number of species to exist within a landscape.
Fire|fire|Fire science is a branch of physical science which includes fire behavior, dynamics, and combustion
Fire|fire|Applications of fire science include fire protection, fire investigation, and wildfire management.
Fire|fire|The fossil record of fire first appears with the establishment of a land-based flora in the Middle Ordovician period, 470 million years ago, permitting the accumulation of oxygen in the atmosphere as never before, as the new hordes of land plants pumped it out as a waste product
Fire|fire|When this concentration rose above 13%, it permitted the possibility of wildfire
Fire|fire|Wildfire is first recorded in the Late Silurian fossil record, 420 million years ago, by fossils of charcoalified plants
Fire|fire|Apart from a controversial gap in the Late Devonian, charcoal is present ever since
Fire|fire|The level of atmospheric oxygen is closely related to the prevalence of charcoal
Fire|fire|clearly oxygen is the key factor in the abundance of wildfire
Fire|fire|Fire also became more abundant when grasses radiated and became the dominant component of many ecosystems, around 6 to 7 million years ago; this kindling provided tinder which allowed for the more rapid spread of fire
Fire|fire|These widespread fires may have initiated a positive feedback process, whereby they produced a warmer, drier climate more conducive to fire.
Fire|fire|The ability to control fire was a dramatic change in the habits of early humans
Fire|fire|Making fire to generate heat and light made it possible for people to cook food, simultaneously increasing the variety and availability of nutrients and reducing disease by killing organisms in the food
Fire|fire|The heat produced would also help people stay warm in cold weather, enabling them to live in cooler climates
Fire|fire|Fire also kept nocturnal predators at bay
Fire|fire|Evidence of cooked food is found from 1 million years ago, although fire was probably not used in a controlled fashion until 400,000 years ago
Fire|fire|There is some evidence that fire may have been used in a controlled fashion about 1 million years ago
Fire|fire|Evidence becomes widespread around 50 to 100 thousand years ago, suggesting regular use from this time; interestingly, resistance to air pollution started to evolve in human populations at a similar point in time
Fire|fire|The use of fire became progressively more sophisticated, with it being used to create charcoal and to control wildlife from 'tens of thousands' of years ago.Fire has also been used for centuries as a method of torture and execution, as evidenced by death by burning as well as torture devices such as the iron boot, which could be filled with water, oil, or even lead and then heated over an open fire to the agony of the wearer.
Fire|fire|By the Neolithic Revolution, during the introduction of grain-based agriculture, people all over the world used fire as a tool in landscape management
Fire|fire|"These fires were typically controlled burns or ""cool fires"", as opposed to uncontrolled ""hot fires"", which damage the soil"
Fire|fire|Hot fires destroy plants and animals, and endanger communities
Fire|fire|This is especially a problem in the forests of today where traditional burning is prevented in order to encourage the growth of timber crops
Fire|fire|Cool fires are generally conducted in the spring and autumn
Fire|fire|They clear undergrowth, burning up biomass that could trigger a hot fire should it get too dense
Fire|fire|They provide a greater variety of environments, which encourages game and plant diversity
Fire|fire|For humans, they make dense, impassable forests traversable
Fire|fire|Another human use for fire in regards to landscape management is its use to clear land for agriculture
Fire|fire|Slash-and-burn agriculture is still common across much of tropical Africa, Asia and South America
Fire|fire|"""For small farmers, it is a convenient way to clear overgrown areas and release nutrients from standing vegetation back into the soil"", said Miguel Pinedo-Vasquez, an ecologist at the Earth Institute’s Center for Environmental Research and Conservation"
Fire|fire|However this useful strategy is also problematic
Fire|fire|Growing population, fragmentation of forests and warming climate are making the earth's surface more prone to ever-larger escaped fires
Fire|fire|These harm ecosystems and human infrastructure, cause health problems, and send up spirals of carbon and soot that may encourage even more warming of the atmosphere – and thus feed back into more fires
Fire|fire|Globally today, as much as 5 million square kilometres – an area more than half the size of the United States – burns in a given year.
Fire|fire|There are numerous modern applications of fire
Fire|fire|In its broadest sense, fire is used by nearly every human being on earth in a controlled setting every day
Fire|fire|Users of internal combustion vehicles employ fire every time they drive
Fire|fire|Thermal power stations provide electricity for a large percentage of humanity by igniting fuels such as coal, oil or natural gas, then using the resultant heat to boil water into steam, which then drives turbines.
Fire|fire|The use of fire in warfare has a long history
Fire|fire|Fire was the basis of all early thermal weapons
Fire|fire|Homer detailed the use of fire by Greek soldiers who hid in a wooden horse to burn Troy during the Trojan war
Fire|fire|Later the Byzantine fleet used Greek fire to attack ships and men
Fire|fire|In the First World War, the first modern flamethrowers were used by infantry, and were successfully mounted on armoured vehicles in the Second World War
Fire|fire|In the latter war, incendiary bombs were used by Axis and Allies alike, notably on Tokyo, Rotterdam, London, Hamburg and, notoriously, at Dresden; in the latter two cases firestorms were deliberately caused in which a ring of fire surrounding each city was drawn inward by an updraft caused by a central cluster of fires
Fire|fire|The United States Army Air Force also extensively used incendiaries against Japanese targets in the latter months of the war, devastating entire cities constructed primarily of wood and paper houses
Fire|fire|The use of napalm was employed in July 1944, towards the end of the Second World War; although its use did not gain public attention until the Vietnam War
Fire|fire|Molotov cocktails were also used.
Fire|fire|Setting fuel aflame releases usable energy
Fire|fire|Wood was a prehistoric fuel, and is still viable today
Fire|fire|The use of fossil fuels, such as petroleum, natural gas, and coal, in power plants supplies the vast majority of the world's electricity today; the International Energy Agency states that nearly 80% of the world's power came from these sources in 2002
Fire|fire|The fire in a power station is used to heat water, creating steam that drives turbines
Fire|fire|The turbines then spin an electric generator to produce electricity
Fire|fire|Fire is also used to provide mechanical work directly, in both external and internal combustion engines.
Fire|fire|Deftly controlling a fire to optimize its size, shape, and intensity is generally called fire management, and the more advanced forms of it, as traditionally (and sometimes still) practiced by skilled cooks, blacksmiths, ironmasters, and others, are highly skilled activities
Fire|fire|They include knowledge about selecting which types of wood, charcoal, or mineral coal to burn; how to arrange the fuel; how to stoke the fire both in early phases and in maintenance phases; how to modulate the amount of heat, flames, and smoke as suited to the desired application; how best to bank a fire to be revived later; how to choose, design, or modify woodstoves, coalstoves, bakery ovens, and industrial furnaces; and so on
Fire|fire|Detailed expositions of fire management are available in various books about blacksmithing, about skilled camping or military scouting, and about the domestic arts in previous centuries.
Fire|fire|Wildfire prevention programs around the world may employ techniques such as wildland fire use and prescribed or controlled burns
Fire|fire|Wildland fire use refers to any fire of natural causes that is monitored but allowed to burn
Fire|fire|Controlled burns are fires ignited by government agencies under less dangerous weather conditions.Fire fighting services are provided in most developed areas to extinguish or contain uncontrolled fires
Fire|fire|Trained firefighters use fire apparatus, water supply resources such as water mains and fire hydrants or they might use A and B class foam depending on what is feeding the fire.
Fire|fire|Fire prevention is intended to reduce sources of ignition
Fire|fire|Fire prevention also includes education to teach people how to avoid causing fires
Fire|fire|Buildings, especially schools and tall buildings, often conduct fire drills to inform and prepare citizens on how to react to a building fire
Fire|fire|Purposely starting destructive fires constitutes arson and is a crime in most jurisdictions.Model building codes require passive fire protection and active fire protection systems to minimize damage resulting from a fire
Fire|fire|The most common form of active fire protection is fire sprinklers
Fire|fire|To maximize passive fire protection of buildings, building materials and furnishings in most developed countries are tested for fire-resistance, combustibility and flammability
Fire|fire|Upholstery, carpeting and plastics used in vehicles and vessels are also tested.
Fire|fire|Different restoration methods and measures are used depending on the type of fire damage that occurred
Fire|fire|Restoration after fire damage can be performed by property management teams, building maintenance personnel, or by the homeowners themselves; however, contacting a certified professional fire damage restoration specialist is often regarded as the safest way to restore fire damaged property due to their training and extensive experience
Fire|fire|"Most are usually listed under ""Fire and Water Restoration"" and they can help speed repairs, whether for individual homeowners or for the largest of institutions.Fire and Water Restoration companies are regulated by the appropriate state's Department of Consumer Affairs – usually the state contractors license board"
Fire|fire|In California, all Fire and Water Restoration companies must register with the California Contractors State License Board
Fire|fire|"Presently, the California Contractors State License Board has no specific classification for ""water and fire damage restoration."" Hence, the Contractor's State License Board requires both an asbestos certification (ASB) as well as a demolition classification (C-21) in order to perform Fire and Water Restoration work."

Atmosphere of Earth|air|The atmosphere of Earth, commonly known as air, is the layer of gases retained by Earth's gravity that surrounds the planet and forms its planetary atmosphere
Atmosphere of Earth|air|The atmosphere of Earth protects life on Earth by creating pressure allowing for liquid water to exist on the Earth's surface, absorbing ultraviolet solar radiation, warming the surface through heat retention (greenhouse effect), and reducing temperature extremes between day and night (the diurnal temperature variation).
Atmosphere of Earth|air|By mole fraction (i.e., by number of molecules), dry air contains 78.08% nitrogen, 20.95% oxygen, 0.93% argon, 0.04% carbon dioxide, and small amounts of other gases
Atmosphere of Earth|air|Air also contains a variable amount of water vapor, on average around 1% at sea level, and 0.4% over the entire atmosphere
Atmosphere of Earth|air|Air composition, temperature, and atmospheric pressure vary with altitude
Atmosphere of Earth|air|Within the atmosphere, air suitable for use in photosynthesis by terrestrial plants and breathing of terrestrial animals is found only in Earth's troposphere.Earth's early atmosphere consisted of gases in the solar nebula, primarily hydrogen
Atmosphere of Earth|air|The atmosphere changed significantly over time, affected by many factors such as volcanism, life, and weathering
Atmosphere of Earth|air|Recently, human activity has also contributed to atmospheric changes, such as global warming, ozone depletion and acid deposition.
Atmosphere of Earth|air|The atmosphere has a mass of about 5.15×1018 kg, three quarters of which is within about 11 km (6.8 mi; 36,000 ft) of the surface
Atmosphere of Earth|air|The atmosphere becomes thinner with increasing altitude, with no definite boundary between the atmosphere and outer space
Atmosphere of Earth|air|The Kármán line, at 100 km (62 mi) or 1.57% of Earth's radius, is often used as the border between the atmosphere and outer space
Atmosphere of Earth|air|Atmospheric effects become noticeable during atmospheric reentry of spacecraft at an altitude of around 120 km (75 mi)
Atmosphere of Earth|air|Several layers can be distinguished in the atmosphere, based on characteristics such as temperature and composition.
Atmosphere of Earth|air|The study of Earth's atmosphere and its processes is called atmospheric science (aerology), and includes multiple subfields, such as climatology and atmospheric physics
Atmosphere of Earth|air|Early pioneers in the field include Léon Teisserenc de Bort and Richard Assmann
Atmosphere of Earth|air|The study of historic atmosphere is called paleoclimatology.
Atmosphere of Earth|air|The three major constituents of Earth's atmosphere are nitrogen, oxygen, and argon
Atmosphere of Earth|air|Water vapor accounts for roughly 0.25% of the atmosphere by mass
Atmosphere of Earth|air|The concentration of water vapor (a greenhouse gas) varies significantly from around 10 ppm by mole fraction in the coldest portions of the atmosphere to as much as 5% by mole fraction in hot, humid air masses, and concentrations of other atmospheric gases are typically quoted in terms of dry air (without water vapor).
Atmosphere of Earth|air|8  The remaining gases are often referred to as trace gases, among which are other greenhouse gases, principally carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide, and ozone
Atmosphere of Earth|air|Besides argon, already mentioned, other noble gases, neon, helium, krypton, and xenon are also present
Atmosphere of Earth|air|Filtered air includes trace amounts of many other chemical compounds
Atmosphere of Earth|air|Many substances of natural origin may be present in locally and seasonally variable small amounts as aerosols in an unfiltered air sample, including dust of mineral and organic composition, pollen and spores, sea spray, and volcanic ash
Atmosphere of Earth|air|Various industrial pollutants also may be present as gases or aerosols, such as chlorine (elemental or in compounds), fluorine compounds and elemental mercury vapor
Atmosphere of Earth|air|Sulfur compounds such as hydrogen sulfide and sulfur dioxide (SO2) may be derived from natural sources or from industrial air pollution.
Atmosphere of Earth|air|The average molecular weight of dry air, which can be used to calculate densities or to convert between mole fraction and mass fraction, is about 28.946 or 28.96 g/mol
Atmosphere of Earth|air|This is decreased when the air is humid.
Atmosphere of Earth|air|In general, air pressure and density decrease with altitude in the atmosphere
Atmosphere of Earth|air|However, the temperature has a more complicated profile with altitude, and may remain relatively constant or even increase with altitude in some regions (see the temperature section, below)
Atmosphere of Earth|air|Because the general pattern of the temperature/altitude profile, or lapse rate, is constant and measurable by means of instrumented balloon soundings, the temperature behavior provides a useful metric to distinguish atmospheric layers
Atmosphere of Earth|air|In this way, Earth's atmosphere can be divided (called atmospheric stratification) into five main layers
Atmosphere of Earth|air|troposphere, stratosphere, mesosphere, thermosphere, and exosphere
Atmosphere of Earth|air|The altitudes of the five layers are as follows:
Atmosphere of Earth|air|Exosphere
Atmosphere of Earth|air|700 to 10,000 km (440 to 6,200 miles)
Atmosphere of Earth|air|Thermosphere
Atmosphere of Earth|air|80 to 700 km (50 to 440 miles)
Atmosphere of Earth|air|Mesosphere
Atmosphere of Earth|air|50 to 80 km (31 to 50 miles)
Atmosphere of Earth|air|Stratosphere
Atmosphere of Earth|air|12 to 50 km (7 to 31 miles)
Atmosphere of Earth|air|Troposphere
Atmosphere of Earth|air|0 to 12 km (0 to 7 miles)
Atmosphere of Earth|air|The exosphere is the outermost layer of Earth's atmosphere (i.e
Atmosphere of Earth|air|the upper limit of the atmosphere)
Atmosphere of Earth|air|It extends from the thermopause, at the top of the thermosphere at an altitude of about 700 km above sea level, to about 10,000 km (6,200 mi; 33,000,000 ft), where it merges into the solar wind.
Atmosphere of Earth|air|This layer is mainly composed of extremely low densities of hydrogen, helium and several heavier molecules including nitrogen, oxygen and carbon dioxide closer to the exobase
Atmosphere of Earth|air|The atoms and molecules are so far apart that they can travel hundreds of kilometers without colliding with one another
Atmosphere of Earth|air|Thus, the exosphere no longer behaves like a gas, and the particles constantly escape into space
Atmosphere of Earth|air|These free-moving particles follow ballistic trajectories and may migrate in and out of the magnetosphere or the solar wind.
Atmosphere of Earth|air|The exosphere is too far above Earth for meteorological phenomena to be possible
Atmosphere of Earth|air|However, Earth's auroras—the aurora borealis (northern lights) and aurora australis (southern lights)—sometimes occur in the lower part of the exosphere, where they overlap into the thermosphere
Atmosphere of Earth|air|The exosphere contains many of the artificial satellites that orbit Earth.
Atmosphere of Earth|air|The thermosphere is the second-highest layer of Earth's atmosphere
Atmosphere of Earth|air|It extends from the mesopause (which separates it from the mesosphere) at an altitude of about 80 km (50 mi; 260,000 ft) up to the thermopause at an altitude range of 500–1000 km (310–620 mi; 1,600,000–3,300,000 ft)
Atmosphere of Earth|air|The height of the thermopause varies considerably due to changes in solar activity
Atmosphere of Earth|air|Because the thermopause lies at the lower boundary of the exosphere, it is also referred to as the exobase
Atmosphere of Earth|air|The lower part of the thermosphere, from 80 to 550 kilometres (50 to 342 mi) above Earth's surface, contains the ionosphere.
Atmosphere of Earth|air|The temperature of the thermosphere gradually increases with height and can rise as high as 1500 °C (2700 °F), though the gas molecules are so far apart that its temperature in the usual sense is not very meaningful
Atmosphere of Earth|air|The air is so rarefied that an individual molecule (of oxygen, for example) travels an average of 1 kilometre (0.62 mi; 3300 ft) between collisions with other molecules
Atmosphere of Earth|air|Although the thermosphere has a high proportion of molecules with high energy, it would not feel hot to a human in direct contact, because its density is too low to conduct a significant amount of energy to or from the skin.
Atmosphere of Earth|air|This layer is completely cloudless and free of water vapor
Atmosphere of Earth|air|However, non-hydrometeorological phenomena such as the aurora borealis and aurora australis are occasionally seen in the thermosphere
Atmosphere of Earth|air|The International Space Station orbits in this layer, between 350 and 420 km (220 and 260 mi)
Atmosphere of Earth|air|It is this layer where many of the satellites orbiting the earth are present.
Atmosphere of Earth|air|The mesosphere is the third highest layer of Earth's atmosphere, occupying the region above the stratosphere and below the thermosphere
Atmosphere of Earth|air|It extends from the stratopause at an altitude of about 50 km (31 mi; 160,000 ft) to the mesopause at 80–85 km (50–53 mi; 260,000–280,000 ft) above sea level.
Atmosphere of Earth|air|Temperatures drop with increasing altitude to the mesopause that marks the top of this middle layer of the atmosphere
Atmosphere of Earth|air|It is the coldest place on Earth and has an average temperature around −85 °C (−120 °F; 190 K).Just below the mesopause, the air is so cold that even the very scarce water vapor at this altitude can sublimate into polar-mesospheric noctilucent clouds
Atmosphere of Earth|air|These are the highest clouds in the atmosphere and may be visible to the naked eye if sunlight reflects off them about an hour or two after sunset or similarly before sunrise
Atmosphere of Earth|air|They are most readily visible when the Sun is around 4 to 16 degrees below the horizon
Atmosphere of Earth|air|Lightning-induced discharges known as transient luminous events (TLEs) occasionally form in the mesosphere above tropospheric thunderclouds
Atmosphere of Earth|air|The mesosphere is also the layer where most meteors burn up upon atmospheric entrance
Atmosphere of Earth|air|It is too high above Earth to be accessible to jet-powered aircraft and balloons, and too low to permit orbital spacecraft
Atmosphere of Earth|air|The mesosphere is mainly accessed by sounding rockets and rocket-powered aircraft.
Atmosphere of Earth|air|The stratosphere is the second-lowest layer of Earth's atmosphere
Atmosphere of Earth|air|It lies above the troposphere and is separated from it by the tropopause
Atmosphere of Earth|air|This layer extends from the top of the troposphere at roughly 12 km (7.5 mi; 39,000 ft) above Earth's surface to the stratopause at an altitude of about 50 to 55 km (31 to 34 mi; 164,000 to 180,000 ft).
Atmosphere of Earth|air|The atmospheric pressure at the top of the stratosphere is roughly 1/1000 the pressure at sea level
Atmosphere of Earth|air|It contains the ozone layer, which is the part of Earth's atmosphere that contains relatively high concentrations of that gas
Atmosphere of Earth|air|The stratosphere defines a layer in which temperatures rise with increasing altitude
Atmosphere of Earth|air|This rise in temperature is caused by the absorption of ultraviolet radiation (UV) radiation from the Sun by the ozone layer, which restricts turbulence and mixing
Atmosphere of Earth|air|Although the temperature may be −60 °C (−76 °F; 210 K) at the tropopause, the top of the stratosphere is much warmer, and may be near 0 °C.The stratospheric temperature profile creates very stable atmospheric conditions, so the stratosphere lacks the weather-producing air turbulence that is so prevalent in the troposphere
Atmosphere of Earth|air|Consequently, the stratosphere is almost completely free of clouds and other forms of weather
Atmosphere of Earth|air|However, polar stratospheric or nacreous clouds are occasionally seen in the lower part of this layer of the atmosphere where the air is coldest
Atmosphere of Earth|air|The stratosphere is the highest layer that can be accessed by jet-powered aircraft.
Atmosphere of Earth|air|The troposphere is the lowest layer of Earth's atmosphere
Atmosphere of Earth|air|It extends from Earth's surface to an average height of about 12 km (7.5 mi; 39,000 ft), although this altitude varies from about 9 km (5.6 mi; 30,000 ft) at the geographic poles to 17 km (11 mi; 56,000 ft) at the Equator, with some variation due to weather
Atmosphere of Earth|air|The troposphere is bounded above by the tropopause, a boundary marked in most places by a temperature inversion (i.e
Atmosphere of Earth|air|a layer of relatively warm air above a colder one), and in others by a zone that is isothermal with height.Although variations do occur, the temperature usually declines with increasing altitude in the troposphere because the troposphere is mostly heated through energy transfer from the surface
Atmosphere of Earth|air|Thus, the lowest part of the troposphere (i.e
Atmosphere of Earth|air|Earth's surface) is typically the warmest section of the troposphere
Atmosphere of Earth|air|"This promotes vertical mixing (hence, the origin of its name in the Greek word τρόπος, tropos, meaning ""turn"")"
Atmosphere of Earth|air|The troposphere contains roughly 80% of the mass of Earth's atmosphere
Atmosphere of Earth|air|The troposphere is denser than all its overlying layers because a larger atmospheric weight sits on top of the troposphere and causes it to be most severely compressed
Atmosphere of Earth|air|Fifty percent of the total mass of the atmosphere is located in the lower 5.6 km (3.5 mi; 18,000 ft) of the troposphere.
Atmosphere of Earth|air|Nearly all atmospheric water vapor or moisture is found in the troposphere, so it is the layer where most of Earth's weather takes place
Atmosphere of Earth|air|It has basically all the weather-associated cloud genus types generated by active wind circulation, although very tall cumulonimbus thunder clouds can penetrate the tropopause from below and rise into the lower part of the stratosphere
Atmosphere of Earth|air|Most conventional aviation activity takes place in the troposphere, and it is the only layer that can be accessed by propeller-driven aircraft.
Atmosphere of Earth|air|The ozone layer is contained within the stratosphere
Atmosphere of Earth|air|In this layer ozone concentrations are about 2 to 8 parts per million, which is much higher than in the lower atmosphere but still very small compared to the main components of the atmosphere
Atmosphere of Earth|air|It is mainly located in the lower portion of the stratosphere from about 15–35 km (9.3–21.7 mi; 49,000–115,000 ft), though the thickness varies seasonally and geographically
Atmosphere of Earth|air|About 90% of the ozone in Earth's atmosphere is contained in the stratosphere.
Atmosphere of Earth|air|The ionosphere is a region of the atmosphere that is ionized by solar radiation
Atmosphere of Earth|air|It is responsible for auroras
Atmosphere of Earth|air|During daytime hours, it stretches from 50 to 1,000 km (31 to 621 mi; 160,000 to 3,280,000 ft) and includes the mesosphere, thermosphere, and parts of the exosphere
Atmosphere of Earth|air|However, ionization in the mesosphere largely ceases during the night, so auroras are normally seen only in the thermosphere and lower exosphere
Atmosphere of Earth|air|The ionosphere forms the inner edge of the magnetosphere
Atmosphere of Earth|air|It has practical importance because it influences, for example, radio propagation on Earth.
Atmosphere of Earth|air|The homosphere and heterosphere are defined by whether the atmospheric gases are well mixed
Atmosphere of Earth|air|The surface-based homosphere includes the troposphere, stratosphere, mesosphere, and the lowest part of the thermosphere, where the chemical composition of the atmosphere does not depend on molecular weight because the gases are mixed by turbulence
Atmosphere of Earth|air|This relatively homogeneous layer ends at the turbopause found at about 100 km (62 mi; 330,000 ft), the very edge of space itself as accepted by the FAI, which places it about 20 km (12 mi; 66,000 ft) above the mesopause.Above this altitude lies the heterosphere, which includes the exosphere and most of the thermosphere
Atmosphere of Earth|air|Here, the chemical composition varies with altitude
Atmosphere of Earth|air|This is because the distance that particles can move without colliding with one another is large compared with the size of motions that cause mixing
Atmosphere of Earth|air|This allows the gases to stratify by molecular weight, with the heavier ones, such as oxygen and nitrogen, present only near the bottom of the heterosphere
Atmosphere of Earth|air|The upper part of the heterosphere is composed almost completely of hydrogen, the lightest element.The planetary boundary layer is the part of the troposphere that is closest to Earth's surface and is directly affected by it, mainly through turbulent diffusion
Atmosphere of Earth|air|During the day the planetary boundary layer usually is well-mixed, whereas at night it becomes stably stratified with weak or intermittent mixing
Atmosphere of Earth|air|The depth of the planetary boundary layer ranges from as little as about 100 metres (330 ft) on clear, calm nights to 3,000 m (9,800 ft) or more during the afternoon in dry regions.The average temperature of the atmosphere at Earth's surface is 14 °C (57 °F; 287 K) or 15 °C (59 °F; 288 K), depending on the reference.
Atmosphere of Earth|air|The average atmospheric pressure at sea level is defined by the International Standard Atmosphere as 101325 pascals (760.00 Torr; 14.6959 psi; 760.00 mmHg)
Atmosphere of Earth|air|This is sometimes referred to as a unit of standard atmospheres (atm)
Atmosphere of Earth|air|Total atmospheric mass is 5.1480×1018 kg (1.135×1019 lb), about 2.5% less than would be inferred from the average sea level pressure and Earth's area of 51007.2 megahectares, this portion being displaced by Earth's mountainous terrain
Atmosphere of Earth|air|Atmospheric pressure is the total weight of the air above unit area at the point where the pressure is measured
Atmosphere of Earth|air|Thus air pressure varies with location and weather.
Atmosphere of Earth|air|If the entire mass of the atmosphere had a uniform density equal to sea level density (about 1.2 kg per m3) from sea level upwards, it would terminate abruptly at an altitude of 8.50 km (27,900 ft)
Atmosphere of Earth|air|It actually decreases exponentially with altitude, dropping by half every 5.6 km (18,000 ft) or by a factor of 1/e every 7.64 km (25,100 ft), the average scale height of the atmosphere below 70 km (43 mi; 230,000 ft)
Atmosphere of Earth|air|However, the atmosphere is more accurately modeled with a customized equation for each layer that takes gradients of temperature, molecular composition, solar radiation and gravity into account.
Atmosphere of Earth|air|99.99997% is below 100 km (62 mi; 330,000 ft), the Kármán line
Atmosphere of Earth|air|By international convention, this marks the beginning of space where human travelers are considered astronauts.By comparison, the summit of Mt
Atmosphere of Earth|air|Everest is at 8,848 m (29,029 ft);
Atmosphere of Earth|air|Even above the Kármán line, significant atmospheric effects such as auroras still occur
Atmosphere of Earth|air|Meteors begin to glow in this region, though the larger ones may not burn up until they penetrate more deeply
Atmosphere of Earth|air|The various layers of Earth's ionosphere, important to HF radio propagation, begin below 100 km and extend beyond 500 km
Atmosphere of Earth|air|By comparison, the International Space Station and Space Shuttle typically orbit at 350–400 km, within the F-layer of the ionosphere where they encounter enough atmospheric drag to require reboosts every few months, otherwise, orbital decay will occur resulting in a return to Earth
Atmosphere of Earth|air|Depending on solar activity, satellites can experience noticeable atmospheric drag at altitudes as high as 700–800 km.
Atmosphere of Earth|air|The division of the atmosphere into layers mostly by reference to temperature is discussed above
Atmosphere of Earth|air|Temperature decreases with altitude starting at sea level, but variations in this trend begin above 11 km, where the temperature stabilizes over a large vertical distance through the rest of the troposphere
Atmosphere of Earth|air|In the stratosphere, starting above about 20 km, the temperature increases with height, due to heating within the ozone layer caused by the capture of significant ultraviolet radiation from the Sun by the dioxygen and ozone gas in this region
Atmosphere of Earth|air|Still another region of increasing temperature with altitude occurs at very high altitudes, in the aptly-named thermosphere above 90 km.
Atmosphere of Earth|air|The density of air at sea level is about 1.2 kg/m3 (1.2 g/L, 0.0012 g/cm3)
Atmosphere of Earth|air|Density is not measured directly but is calculated from measurements of temperature, pressure and humidity using the equation of state for air (a form of the ideal gas law)
Atmosphere of Earth|air|Atmospheric density decreases as the altitude increases
Atmosphere of Earth|air|This variation can be approximately modeled using the barometric formula
Atmosphere of Earth|air|More sophisticated models are used to predict the orbital decay of satellites.
Atmosphere of Earth|air|The average mass of the atmosphere is about 5 quadrillion (5×1015) tonnes or 1/1,200,000 the mass of Earth
Atmosphere of Earth|air|"According to the American National Center for Atmospheric Research, ""The total mean mass of the atmosphere is 5.1480×1018 kg with an annual range due to water vapor of 1.2 or 1.5×1015 kg, depending on whether surface pressure or water vapor data are used; somewhat smaller than the previous estimate"
Atmosphere of Earth|air|"The mean mass of water vapor is estimated as 1.27×1016 kg and the dry air mass as 5.1352 ±0.0003×1018 kg."""
Atmosphere of Earth|air|Solar radiation (or sunlight) is the energy Earth receives from the Sun
Atmosphere of Earth|air|Earth also emits radiation back into space, but at longer wavelengths that humans cannot see
Atmosphere of Earth|air|Part of the incoming and emitted radiation is absorbed or reflected by the atmosphere
Atmosphere of Earth|air|In May 2017, glints of light, seen as twinkling from an orbiting satellite a million miles away, were found to be reflected light from ice crystals in the atmosphere.
Atmosphere of Earth|air|When light passes through Earth's atmosphere, photons interact with it through scattering
Atmosphere of Earth|air|If the light does not interact with the atmosphere, it is called direct radiation and is what you see if you were to look directly at the Sun
Atmosphere of Earth|air|Indirect radiation is light that has been scattered in the atmosphere
Atmosphere of Earth|air|For example, on an overcast day when you cannot see your shadow, there is no direct radiation reaching you, it has all been scattered
Atmosphere of Earth|air|As another example, due to a phenomenon called Rayleigh scattering, shorter (blue) wavelengths scatter more easily than longer (red) wavelengths
Atmosphere of Earth|air|This is why the sky looks blue; you are seeing scattered blue light
Atmosphere of Earth|air|This is also why sunsets are red
Atmosphere of Earth|air|Because the Sun is close to the horizon, the Sun's rays pass through more atmosphere than normal before reaching your eye
Atmosphere of Earth|air|Much of the blue light has been scattered out, leaving the red light in a sunset.
Atmosphere of Earth|air|Different molecules absorb different wavelengths of radiation
Atmosphere of Earth|air|For example, O2 and O3 absorb almost all radiation with wavelengths shorter than 300 nanometers
Atmosphere of Earth|air|Water (H2O) absorbs at many wavelengths above 700 nm
Atmosphere of Earth|air|When a molecule absorbs a photon, it increases the energy of the molecule
Atmosphere of Earth|air|This heats the atmosphere, but the atmosphere also cools by emitting radiation, as discussed below.
Atmosphere of Earth|air|"The combined absorption spectra of the gases in the atmosphere leave ""windows"" of low opacity, allowing the transmission of only certain bands of light"
Atmosphere of Earth|air|The optical window runs from around 300 nm (ultraviolet-C) up into the range humans can see, the visible spectrum (commonly called light), at roughly 400–700 nm and continues to the infrared to around 1100 nm
Atmosphere of Earth|air|There are also infrared and radio windows that transmit some infrared and radio waves at longer wavelengths
Atmosphere of Earth|air|For example, the radio window runs from about one centimeter to about eleven-meter waves.
Atmosphere of Earth|air|Emission is the opposite of absorption, it is when an object emits radiation
Atmosphere of Earth|air|"Objects tend to emit amounts and wavelengths of radiation depending on their ""black body"" emission curves, therefore hotter objects tend to emit more radiation, with shorter wavelengths"
Atmosphere of Earth|air|Colder objects emit less radiation, with longer wavelengths
Atmosphere of Earth|air|For example, the Sun is approximately 6,000 K (5,730 °C; 10,340 °F), its radiation peaks near 500 nm, and is visible to the human eye
Atmosphere of Earth|air|Earth is approximately 290 K (17 °C; 62 °F), so its radiation peaks near 10,000 nm, and is much too long to be visible to humans.
Atmosphere of Earth|air|Because of its temperature, the atmosphere emits infrared radiation
Atmosphere of Earth|air|For example, on clear nights Earth's surface cools down faster than on cloudy nights
Atmosphere of Earth|air|This is because clouds (H2O) are strong absorbers and emitters of infrared radiation
Atmosphere of Earth|air|This is also why it becomes colder at night at higher elevations.
Atmosphere of Earth|air|The greenhouse effect is directly related to this absorption and emission effect
Atmosphere of Earth|air|Some gases in the atmosphere absorb and emit infrared radiation, but do not interact with sunlight in the visible spectrum
Atmosphere of Earth|air|Common examples of these are CO2 and H2O.
Atmosphere of Earth|air|The refractive index of air is close to, but just greater than 1
Atmosphere of Earth|air|Systematic variations in the refractive index can lead to the bending of light rays over long optical paths
Atmosphere of Earth|air|One example is that, under some circumstances, observers onboard ships can see other vessels just over the horizon because light is refracted in the same direction as the curvature of Earth's surface.
Atmosphere of Earth|air|The refractive index of air depends on temperature, giving rise to refraction effects when the temperature gradient is large
Atmosphere of Earth|air|An example of such effects is the mirage.
Atmosphere of Earth|air|Atmospheric circulation is the large-scale movement of air through the troposphere, and the means (with ocean circulation) by which heat is distributed around Earth
Atmosphere of Earth|air|The large-scale structure of the atmospheric circulation varies from year to year, but the basic structure remains fairly constant because it is determined by Earth's rotation rate and the difference in solar radiation between the equator and poles.
Atmosphere of Earth|air|The first atmosphere consisted of gases in the solar nebula, primarily hydrogen
Atmosphere of Earth|air|There were probably simple hydrides such as those now found in the gas giants (Jupiter and Saturn), notably water vapor, methane and ammonia.
Atmosphere of Earth|air|Outgassing from volcanism, supplemented by gases produced during the late heavy bombardment of Earth by huge asteroids, produced the next atmosphere, consisting largely of nitrogen plus carbon dioxide and inert gases
Atmosphere of Earth|air|A major part of carbon-dioxide emissions dissolved in water and reacted with metals such as calcium and magnesium during weathering of crustal rocks to form carbonates that were deposited as sediments
Atmosphere of Earth|air|"Water-related sediments have been found that date from as early as 3.8 billion years ago.About 3.4 billion years ago, nitrogen formed the major part of the then stable ""second atmosphere"""
Atmosphere of Earth|air|The influence of life has to be taken into account rather soon in the history of the atmosphere because hints of early life-forms appear as early as 3.5 billion years ago
Atmosphere of Earth|air|"How Earth at that time maintained a climate warm enough for liquid water and life, if the early Sun put out 30% lower solar radiance than today, is a puzzle known as the ""faint young Sun paradox""."
Atmosphere of Earth|air|The geological record however shows a continuous relatively warm surface during the complete early temperature record of Earth – with the exception of one cold glacial phase about 2.4 billion years ago
Atmosphere of Earth|air|In the late Archean Eon an oxygen-containing atmosphere began to develop, apparently produced by photosynthesizing cyanobacteria (see Great Oxygenation Event), which have been found as stromatolite fossils from 2.7 billion years ago
Atmosphere of Earth|air|The early basic carbon isotopy (isotope ratio proportions) strongly suggests conditions similar to the current, and that the fundamental features of the carbon cycle became established as early as 4 billion years ago.
Atmosphere of Earth|air|Ancient sediments in the Gabon dating from between about 2.15 and 2.08 billion years ago provide a record of Earth's dynamic oxygenation evolution
Atmosphere of Earth|air|These fluctuations in oxygenation were likely driven by the Lomagundi carbon isotope excursion.
Atmosphere of Earth|air|The constant re-arrangement of continents by plate tectonics influences the long-term evolution of the atmosphere by transferring carbon dioxide to and from large continental carbonate stores
Atmosphere of Earth|air|Free oxygen did not exist in the atmosphere until about 2.4 billion years ago during the Great Oxygenation Event and its appearance is indicated by the end of the banded iron formations.
Atmosphere of Earth|air|Before this time, any oxygen produced by photosynthesis was consumed by the oxidation of reduced materials, notably iron
Atmosphere of Earth|air|Free oxygen molecules did not start to accumulate in the atmosphere until the rate of production of oxygen began to exceed the availability of reducing materials that removed oxygen
Atmosphere of Earth|air|This point signifies a shift from a reducing atmosphere to an oxidizing atmosphere
Atmosphere of Earth|air|O2 showed major variations until reaching a steady state of more than 15% by the end of the Precambrian
Atmosphere of Earth|air|The following time span from 541 million years ago to the present day is the Phanerozoic Eon, during the earliest period of which, the Cambrian, oxygen-requiring metazoan life forms began to appear.
Atmosphere of Earth|air|The amount of oxygen in the atmosphere has fluctuated over the last 600 million years, reaching a peak of about 30% around 280 million years ago, significantly higher than today's 21%
Atmosphere of Earth|air|Two main processes govern changes in the atmosphere
Atmosphere of Earth|air|Plants using carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and releasing oxygen, and then plants using some oxygen at night by the process of photorespiration while the remaining oxygen is used to break down organic material
Atmosphere of Earth|air|Breakdown of pyrite and volcanic eruptions release sulfur into the atmosphere, which reacts with oxygen and hence reduces its amount in the atmosphere
Atmosphere of Earth|air|However, volcanic eruptions also release carbon dioxide, which plants can convert to oxygen
Atmosphere of Earth|air|The cause of the variation of the amount of oxygen in the atmosphere is not known
Atmosphere of Earth|air|Periods with much oxygen in the atmosphere are associated with the rapid development of animals because oxygen is the high-energy molecule needed to power all complex life-forms
Atmosphere of Earth|air|Today's atmosphere contains 21% oxygen, which is great enough for this rapid development of animals.
Atmosphere of Earth|air|Air pollution is the introduction into the atmosphere of chemicals, particulate matter or biological materials that cause harm or discomfort to organisms
Atmosphere of Earth|air|Stratospheric ozone depletion is caused by air pollution, chiefly from chlorofluorocarbons and other ozone-depleting substances.
Atmosphere of Earth|air|Since 1750, human activity has increased the concentrations various greenhouse gases, most importantly carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide
Atmosphere of Earth|air|This increase has caused an observed rise in global temperatures
Atmosphere of Earth|air|Global average surface temperatures were 1.1 °C higher in the 2011-2020 decade than they were in 1850.
Atmosphere of Earth|air|On October 19, 2015, NASA started a website containing daily images of the full sunlit side of Earth at https://epic.gsfc.nasa.gov/
Atmosphere of Earth|air|The images are taken from the Deep Space Climate Observatory (DSCOVR) and show Earth as it rotates during a day.

Zuko|zuko|Zuko travels to Kori's hometown, and Fire Nation Colony, Yu Dao, where he meets people of Fire Nation and the Earth Kingdom ancestry living and working together
Zuko|zuko|Zuko becomes conflicted and consults with the imprisoned Ozai, who advises Zuko that whatever decision he makes is inherently the correct choice because he exercises the power of the Fire Lord
Zuko|zuko|Zuko decides to break from the Harmony Restoration Movement
Zuko|zuko|The Earth King responds with a military force of his own and Zuko is forced to lead troops to Yu Dao to protect the Fire Nation civilians
Zuko|zuko|In the battle, Aang and Zuko clash
Zuko|zuko|However, Katara convinces the Earth King that the colonies are neither Fire Nation nor the Earth Kingdom, but rather a multicultural people
Zuko|zuko|Peace is restored, and Zuko realizes that forcing Aang to make the promise was a way of distancing himself from his responsibilities as Fire Lord
Zuko|zuko|He releases Aang from the promise, and the two reestablish their friendship and trust.
Zuko|zuko|In various flashbacks in The Search, it is revealed that Zuko's mother, Ursa, was previously engaged to a man named Ikem in her hometown of Hira'a, but had to leave him after being pressured into marrying Fire Lord Ozai
Zuko|zuko|Even after Zuko's birth, Ursa continued to write letters to Ikem, but Ozai intercepted the letters
Zuko|zuko|Ursa, suspecting the interception, writes a letter claiming Zuko is Ikem's son rather than Ozai's
Zuko|zuko|Ozai confronts her, and although he believes Zuko is truly his son, he retaliates by claiming to have ordered Ikem to be killed and stating he will treat Zuko as if he were actually Ikem's son.
Zuko|zuko|A later flashback reveals that Ursa was responsible for creating an untraceable poison used by Ozai to kill Fire Lord Azulon in order to protect Zuko from Azulon
Zuko|zuko|Ozai, fearing that Ursa would one day use the same poison against him, banishes Ursa from the palace the same night.
Zuko|zuko|In the present, Azula reveals to Zuko she had access to the letters intercepted by Ozai
Zuko|zuko|She uses her knowledge of their contents as leverage to be allowed to come with Zuko to find Ursa
Zuko|zuko|Zuko and Azula travel with Aang, Katara, and Sokka to Hira'a
Zuko|zuko|On the journey, Zuko tries to be more compassionate towards Azula, who suffers from erratic behavior and hallucinations following her mental breakdown
Zuko|zuko|Zuko discovers the letter from Ursa stating that Zuko is Ikem's son, and begins to doubt if he is the rightful Fire Lord
Zuko|zuko|Azula manipulates these doubts to weaken Zuko's resolve to be Fire Lord.
Zuko|zuko|Zuko and Azula discover that Ursa is alive and married to Ikem, having had her memories erased and appearance changed by a spirit to relieve her of the pain of losing her children
Zuko|zuko|Zuko is satisfied to know that Ursa is happy and is prepared to leave Ursa in peace, but with Ikem's encouragement, reveals to her that he is her forgotten son
Zuko|zuko|Zuko also says that he is Ikem's son, but Ikem says that this is not possible, implying that he and Ursa never had intercourse before her marriage to Ozai
Zuko|zuko|Azula attacks Ursa and Zuko and tries to persuade Zuko to give up the throne
Zuko|zuko|Zuko reaffirms his commitment to his destiny as Fire Lord as well as their relationship as brother and sister
Zuko|zuko|Azula's emotional and mental resolve breaks, and she flees into the forest.
Zuko|zuko|Ursa chooses to have her memories and appearance restored by the spirit
Zuko|zuko|Ursa reveals her past to Zuko, including that the letter claiming he was Ikem's son is false and that he is the rightful Fire Lord.
Zuko|zuko|Weeks later, in Smoke and Shadow, Azula secretly manipulates Ozai loyalists into taking actions against Zuko, including an assassination attempt and kidnapping schemes that target Zuko's family and allies
Zuko|zuko|In response, Zuko begins making harsher decisions in an attempt to preserve security and authority
Zuko|zuko|Zuko's decisions are criticized by his allies and citizens as excessive
Zuko|zuko|This leads to protesting and rioting within the Fire Nation capitol
Zuko|zuko|Zuko and his allies eventually discover Azula's plot
Zuko|zuko|Before escaping, Azula says she has accepted Fire Lord Zuko's claim as rightful Fire Lord, and has also accepted her own destiny to shape Zuko into becoming a stronger and more ruthless leader
Zuko|zuko|In a speech, Fire Lord Zuko apologizes to his people and asks for their forgiveness, patience and trust as he tries to become a better leader.

Zuko|zuko|In Book Three
Zuko|zuko|Change, it is revealed that Zuko worked with the Order of the White Lotus to keep major threats in check in the years before Avatar Korra was able
Zuko|zuko|Most notably, he worked alongside Sokka, Aang's son Tenzin, and Korra's father Tonraq to thwart an attempt by the criminal Zaheer and his Red Lotus followers to kidnap Korra when she was a child
Zuko|zuko|Fourteen years later, Zuko learns that Zaheer has become an airbender and escaped from prison

Zuko|zuko|Book Four
Zuko|zuko|Balance
Zuko|zuko|Zuko makes a final non-speaking appearance in Book Four
Zuko|zuko|Balance, attending the coronation of Prince Wu along with Izumi.
Zuko|zuko|The Blue Spirit design was inspired from a Dragon King Nuo mask from Chinese drama
Zuko|zuko|His mask was made blue, because the creators thought that a red mask would give away the Blue Spirit's secret identity to the audience too easily.
Zuko|zuko|Zuko lives in a fantasy world where the human population consists of four nations
Zuko|zuko|the Earth Kingdom, the Water Tribes, the Air Nomads, and the Fire Nation
Zuko|zuko|Some individuals can telekinetically manipulate one of the four classical elements
Zuko|zuko|"water, earth, fire, or air; the art of controlling and manipulating an element is called ""bending."" The Avatar is the only individual who can bend all four elements"
Zuko|zuko|100 years before the beginning of the narrative, Fire Lord Sozin, then the ruler of the Fire Nation, carried out a genocide of the Air Nomads as part of his plan to conquer the world for the Fire Nation.
Zuko|zuko|A few years before the events of the series, Zuko voiced opposition to a general's suggestion that inexperienced Fire Nation soldiers be used as bait in a battle against the Earth Kingdom
Zuko|zuko|Fire Lord Ozai, Zuko's father, ordered Zuko to submit to an Agni Kai, a ritual duel fought with firebending, to teach him respect
Zuko|zuko|Zuko accepted the challenge believing that he would fight the general who proposed the plan, but instead he faced Ozai
Zuko|zuko|When Zuko refused to fight his father, the Fire Lord mutilated his face, scarring him over his left eye, and sent him into exile
Zuko|zuko|Zuko is told by Ozai that his honor and position would be restored only if he captured the Avatar, who at the time had not been seen for an entire century
Zuko|zuko|Zuko's uncle, the decorated general Iroh, joined him as a companion and tutor.
Zuko|zuko|Despite his youth, Zuko has demonstrated great agility and strength
Zuko|zuko|His chief education in this is derived from his uncle Iroh; flashbacks reveal that Zuko's skills were subpar as a preteen, but that they improved dramatically under Iroh's tutelage
Zuko|zuko|He is twice shown to be a match in combat to his sister Azula, although he lacks the emotional discipline to generate lightning
Zuko|zuko|He is depicted throughout the series as both powerful and skillful in both martial and aesthetic applications of firebending.
Zuko|zuko|"Zuko is skilled in ""Dao duel-wielding,"" as in the episode ""The Blue Spirit"" wherein he withstands a large number of adversaries"
Zuko|zuko|"In ""Avatar"
Zuko|zuko|"The Lost Adventures,"" it was revealed that he studied under Master Piandao, his uncle's colleague and Sokka's master sword fighting instructor"
Zuko|zuko|Zuko has also demonstrated an ability in stealth and unarmed combat, as when able to infiltrate a Fire Nation fortress, the Northern Water Tribe's city, and the Dai Li's base in the Earth Kingdom without detection
Zuko|zuko|"His proficiency at stealth was also utilized during the episode ""The Southern Raiders"" in which he and Katara stalked and cornered the former commander of the eponymous Raiders in his home village without revealing themselves"
Zuko|zuko|Avatar Extras revealed he has abnormal hearing and that he is also naturally gifted at playing the Tsungi horn (though he is never heard playing).
Zuko|zuko|Zuko is highly skilled in Firebending which utilizes Chinese martial arts techniques of Changquan, Shaolinquan, Lóng Xíng Mó Qiáo and Xing Yi Quan
Zuko|zuko|The series' creators consulted a professional martial artist in the design of the show's fighting style
Zuko|zuko|"Firebending represents the element of power, and is categorized as the most aggressive of the ""four bending arts."" Firebender discipline stresses self-restraint and breath control as a means of directing and containing the fire manifested"
Zuko|zuko|Poor breath control means dangerously poor control of any fire generated
Zuko|zuko|For this reason, breathing exercises are one of the most critical first steps for beginning firebenders.
Zuko|zuko|Water is cool and soothing, Earth is steady and stable
Zuko|zuko|But Fire..
Zuko|zuko|Fire is alive
Zuko|zuko|Has the potential to create or destroy
Zuko|zuko|It breathes, it grows
Zuko|zuko|Without the Bender, a rock will not throw itself
Zuko|zuko|But Fire will spread and destroy everything in its path if one does not have the will to control it!
Zuko|zuko|Fire can be used as a force of destruction, but is associated with creating and respecting life, as unlike the our elements, it is the only one that has a life of its own
Zuko|zuko|The art of firebending is to control facilitate and understand that life
Zuko|zuko|"Firebending involves ""external styles"" that prioritize one's legwork (as opposed to the arms) and emphasizes ""kicking over hand fighting""; the highly technical kicking strikes are meant to ""extend as far as possible"" without compromising balance"
Zuko|zuko|This is intended to sacrifice defense for optimized preemptive strikes and attrition warfare
Zuko|zuko|"Zuko's interpretation of firebending uses long, aggressive techniques that explode and drive through the opponent; quick, successive attacks that utilize momentary bursts of extreme ""explosive"" power; with fundamentally strong movements' and the usage of powerful, quick manoeuvres"
Zuko|zuko|"This is depicted in the ""Agni Kai"" or fire-duels that Zuko competes in."
Zuko|zuko|"A century of warfare has corrupted the Fire Nation's rich culture, and with it, their firebending-styles were erased from history, being ""regressed"" into militarized format based on hatred and raw aggression; Zuko and Aang rediscovered firebending in its purest and most harmonious form, Dancing Dragon Style, from the last surviving dragons"
Zuko|zuko|Dragon Style is the bending art first practiced by the Sun Warriors, the earliest incarnation of the modern Fire Nation; for the Sun Warriors, fire is life, energy, and creativity, rather than destruction and hate
Zuko|zuko|And by extension a true firebending master should be able to appreciate the life in all things.
Zuko|zuko|Zuko's character has received overwhemingly positive reception from critics and audiences alike
Zuko|zuko|He is considered by several critics to have one of the best redemption arcs in television
Zuko|zuko|"Tory Ireland Mell of IGN thought it was ""painful"" to watch Zuko try to win the trust of Team Avatar as he was ""completely vulnerable, and no one cared."" Mell found his reunion with Iroh to be ""heartwarming."" Zuko was listed by Zach Blumenfeld from Paste as the best character from the Avatar universe, with Blumenfeld noting his complex transformation and redemption story over the course of the series"
Zuko|zuko|Dante Basco received praise for his portrayal of the character.

Appa (character)|appa|阿柏; pinyin
Appa (character)|appa|Ā Bǎi) is a fictional character on the Nickelodeon animated television series Avatar
Appa (character)|appa|The Last Airbender and in the film The Last Airbender
Appa (character)|appa|In the series, Appa is the only known living sky flat-tailed  flying bison, a species of animals that can fly naturally, and is the animal spirit guide of the protagonist, Aang
Appa (character)|appa|Dee Bradley Baker voices Appa, along with all the other animals, in both the TV series and the film.
Appa (character)|appa|The show's creators Michael Dante DiMartino and Bryan Konietzko have described Appa's appearance as a cross between a buffalo and a manatee, although its body plan does resemble that of a water bear
Appa (character)|appa|According to an interview with the artists involved with creating the show, Appa's design was based on that of Catbus from the movie My Neighbor Totoro, as they found it difficult to create a six-legged mammal.
Appa (character)|appa|In the Avatar franchise, Appa is the last known living sky bison, which are large mammal-like creatures that fly through airbending and steer through air currents with their broad tails
Appa (character)|appa|The bison are covered in thick white fur with a large brown arrow marking that is remarked to be extremely itchy
Appa (character)|appa|In the show, the markings on the flying bison's backs are what inspired the tattoos which symbolize an Air Nomad's mastery of Airbending
Appa (character)|appa|Their fur is shed at the end of winter
Appa (character)|appa|The Air Nomads summon the sky bison to their side through the use of whistles that only the animals can hear
Appa (character)|appa|"Aang and friends use the words ""yip yip"" to get Appa to take off into the air."

Appa (character)|appa|It is tradition with Air Nomads that each young Airbender is given a sky bison calf once they come of age to be the Airbender's lifelong animal companion
Appa (character)|appa|In a flashback on Appa's Lost Days, Appa's herd flies down to an Air Nomad Temple where Aang and other young Airbenders are waiting
Appa (character)|appa|"Aang brings Appa an apple as a sign of friendship, which Appa accepts, sealing their bond as well as giving Appa his name, after the word ""apple"""
Appa (character)|appa|Almost immediately, the two became friends and would remain close, Appa being the one thing aside from his staff and robes from Aang's home that Aang took with him when he fled the Southern Air Temple.Appa remained in suspended animation along with Aang for 100 years until their discovery by Katara and Sokka.
Appa (character)|appa|Since then, Appa has been the group's main form of transportation in their quest, as well as occasionally assisting in battle

Appa (character)|appa|Appa eventually returns to the main group in the last scenes of Lake Laogai.Appa still accompanies Aang and his group even after they enter the Fire Nation
Appa (character)|appa|However, in order to make sure that he does not give away Aang's identity when flying, Aang covers Appa with clouds as a disguise while in flight.At the Western Air Temple, he was among the first members of the group to accept Zuko as Aang's firebending teacher, as he is still grateful for Zuko freeing him in Ba Sing Se
Appa (character)|appa|He flew Aang and Zuko to the Sun Warrior Temple in order to learn the origin of firebending.
Appa (character)|appa|He also flew Zuko and Katara to the Southern Raiders ship, so Katara could confront the murderer of her mother.After the search for Aang in the finale failed, the group was forced to divide their efforts to prevent the Fire Nation from wiping out the Earth Kingdom

Appa (character)|appa|Afterward, Appa is last seen outside of Iroh's tea shop in Ba Sing Se, listening to Iroh play a horn.
Appa (character)|appa|Appa appears in the 2010 live-action film The Last Airbender with roar effects provided by Dee Bradley Baker
Appa (character)|appa|Appa's role in the film has been noted to be significantly less prominent than in the animated series.The sky bison was rendered entirely in computer graphics for the film by Industrial Light & Magic (ILM), with Pablo Helman as visual-effects supervisor
Appa (character)|appa|Regarding the challenges of adapting the cartoon Appa into a realistic-looking CGI beast, Helman said:
Appa (character)|appa|"""He has six legs, and that's a big challenge for us, because how do you take it into reality"
Appa (character)|appa|There is no reference for a creature with six legs
Appa (character)|appa|Nature doesn't create those things
Appa (character)|appa|It's very difficult to get six legs to do the right thing
Appa (character)|appa|We looked at how elephants walked, which helped
Appa (character)|appa|"We did some tests and figured out Appa would pretty much move like an elephant."""

Appa (character)|appa|"Correspondingly, MTV's Rick Marshall provided instructions online on ""how to find the elusive Appa"" for the character's brief appearance in the background of a trailer scene.As with the rest of the film, Appa's appearance in The Last Airbender was met with largely negative reviews"
Appa (character)|appa|"Geekosystem's Susana Polo found the CGI version of Appa ""really quite creepy,"" noting ""that prey animals (like bison) have eyes on the sides of their heads, and so moving them to the front without changing rest of the facial structure tips us right into the Uncanny Valley.""

Aang|aang|Even prior to learning he was the Avatar, Aang distinguished himself by becoming one of the youngest Airbending Masters in history by inventing a new technique
Aang|aang|As a result of Fire Lord Sozin's increasingly hostile attitude towards the other nations, the senior monks decided to reveal Aang's nature as the Avatar four years before the traditional age (Avatars are usually told of their status once they turn 16) and relocate him to one of the other Air Temples
Aang|aang|Learning that he was to be taken from Gyatso caused Aang to flee the monastery on his flying bison, Appa, before being caught by a storm; the life-or-death conditions triggered the Avatar State, encasing the young Avatar and his bison in an air-pocket among icebergs, where he remained suspended for a century

Aang|aang|After a period of entertainment, Aang is contacted by his former life Yangchen, who tried contacting him about Old Iron's return
Aang|aang|Aang also has a fight with the Rough Rhinos when they try to oust him from the Eastern Fire Refinery
Aang|aang|Aang then aids in preventing Azula, disguised as the Kemurikage, from stealing any more children.
Aang|aang|Being frozen in an iceberg for 100 years while in the Avatar State drained much of Aang's life energy
Aang|aang|While he did not feel the effects for many years, after he entered middle age in his 50s, the strain of this exertion increasingly weighed upon his body
Aang|aang|Ultimately, it resulted in Aang dying at the relatively young biological age of 66 since he was in the ice for 100 years, in 153 AG
Aang|aang|Aang was survived by his wife, Katara, and his three children, but he did not live to see his grandchildren, all of whom would become powerful airbenders
Aang|aang|Prior to his death, Aang tasked the Order of the White Lotus with finding and guiding the new Avatar after him
Aang|aang|When Aang died, the Avatar spirit reincarnated into Korra of the Southern Water Tribe
Aang|aang|Aang intended for the Order to simply guide and guard Korra, but several mishaps in the aftermath of Aang's death (including a kidnapping attempt by the anarchist Zaheer) and the still-fragile state of relations between the now-Five Nations resulted in Katara and Tenzin sequestering Korra in a compound at the South Pole, bringing teachers to her instead of allowing her to seek out her own.
Aang|aang|Book One
Aang|aang|Air
Aang|aang|In the sequel series' first season, Avatar Aang's spirit occasionally serves as the spiritual advisor to seventeen-year-old Korra (much like the previous Avatar incarnation, Roku, did for Aang)
Aang|aang|Korra struggles with the spiritual aspects of bending and being the avatar, so initially Aang is only able to give Korra glimpses of his memory concerning Yakone in relation to her confrontations with his two sons, Amon and Tarrlok, the products of Yakone's Bloodbending vendetta on the Avatar
Aang|aang|It is only after she loses her ability to bend that Korra allows herself to listen to her past lives, at which point Aang is able to manifest more directly to her and helps to restore her powers by triggering the Avatar State and teaching her to Energybend.
Aang|aang|Book Two
Aang|aang|Spirits
Aang|aang|The sequel series' second season reveals that Avatar Aang apparently treated Tenzin as his favorite child, due to his son's Airbender status; Kya and Bumi mentioned to Tenzin that Aang always took Tenzin on vacations with him, but never them
Aang|aang|Aang's Air Acolytes also were unaware that Aang had two other children besides Tenzin
Aang|aang|Tenzin himself insists that Aang loved all his children equally, but that Aang took more precedence in raising him since Tenzin would have to take care of future generations of airbenders
Aang|aang|Aang himself later appears, along with Roku, Kyoshi and Kuruk, before Korra in a vision and encourages her to learn the origins of Wan (the first Avatar) and Raava
Aang|aang|Aang, or possibly a vision of him, later appears in the Spirit World, encouraging Tenzin to move past the enormous legacy of being Aang's son and find his own path
Aang|aang|Korra's connection to Aang and the other preceding Avatars is severed when Vaatu extracts and subsequently kills Raava, the divine Avatar Spirit entity within her
Aang|aang|Even though Raava is reborn and fused again with Korra, she discovers, to her dismay, that her spiritual connection to Aang and all past Avatars is gone forever.
Aang|aang|Book Three
Aang|aang|Change
Aang|aang|When Zaheer gave an ultimatum
Aang|aang|Surrender to him or lose the new airbenders, Korra meditated into the spirit realm, she expressed her wish to call upon Aang's spirit and ask his advice in saving the new Air Nomads
Aang|aang|Iroh's spirit assured her that, even though Aang was no longer able to guide her, she could ask one of Aang's closest friends
Aang|aang|Lord Zuko.
Aang|aang|Aang's character appeared in the Avatar
Aang|aang|The Last Airbender Trading Card Game on a multitude of cards
Aang|aang|He appeared in the Avatar
Aang|aang|The Last Airbender video game as one of the four playable characters
Aang|aang|Two sequels were made
Aang|aang|Avatar
Aang|aang|The Last Airbender – The Burning Earth, followed by Avatar
Aang|aang|The Last Airbender – Into the Inferno
Aang|aang|Aang appears as a playable racer in Nickelodeon Kart Racers 2
Aang|aang|Grand Prix.
Aang|aang|Aang also appeared in Escape from the Spirit World, an online video game that can be found on Nickelodeon's official website
Aang|aang|The game includes certain plot changes that are not shown in the show
Aang|aang|The show's directors, Michael DiMartino and Bryan Konietzko, claim the events are canon
Aang|aang|Aang is also a playable character in the Nickelodeon game Super Brawl Universe
Aang|aang|There is also a location in the game set in the Air Temple
Aang|aang|Tokyopop has published a films comic (sometimes referred to as cine-manga), in which Aang, being the main character of the show, appears repeatedly.In 2010, director M
Aang|aang|Night Shyamalan cast 12-year-old Tae Kwon Do practitioner Noah Ringer as Aang in the film adaptation of the series, The Last Airbender
Aang|aang|His name in the film is pronounced [ɑŋ] instead of [eəŋ]
Aang|aang|The casting of a presumed white actor in the role of Aang (as well as a primarily Caucasian cast) in the Asian-influenced Avatar universe triggered negative reactions from some fans, marked by accusations of racism, a letter-writing campaign, and a protest outside of a Philadelphia casting call for movie extras
Aang|aang|A counter-movement was spawned in response by other fans who believed the casting was appropriate
Aang|aang|The casting decisions were also negatively received by several critics, who stated that the original casting call expressed a preference for Caucasian actors over others
Aang|aang|Noah Ringer later identified himself to Entertainment Weekly as an American Indian.
Aang|aang|Aang's character was developed from a drawing by Bryan Konietzko, depicting a bald man with an arrowlike design on his head, which the artist developed into a picture of a child with a flying bison
Aang|aang|Meanwhile, Michael Dante DiMartino was interested in a documentary about explorers trapped in the South Pole, which he later combined with Konietzko's drawing.
Aang|aang|The plot they described corresponds with the first and second episodes of Avatar
Aang|aang|"The Last Airbender, where the ""water people"" (Katara and Sokka) rescue the ""air guy"" (Aang) while ""trapped in a snowy wasteland"" (the Southern Water Tribe) with ""some fire people [that] are pressing down on them"" (Fire Nation Troops and Zuko)"
Aang|aang|The creators of the show intended Aang to be trapped in an iceberg for one hundred years, later to wake inside a futuristic world, wherein he would have a robot named Momo and a dozen bisons
Aang|aang|The creators lost interest in this theme, and changed it to one hundred years of suspended animation
Aang|aang|"The robotic Momo became a flying lemur, and the herd of bison was reduced to one.In the episode ""Tales of Ba Sing Se"", Aang's name was written as 安昂 (ān áng) in Chinese."
Aang|aang|"According to the show's creators, ""Buddhism and Taoism have been huge inspirations behind the idea for Avatar."" As shown in ""The King of Omashu"" and ""The Headband"", a notable aspect of Aang's character is his vegetarian diet, which is consistent with Buddhism, Hinduism, and Taoism"
Aang|aang|In the Brahmajala Sutra, a Buddhist code of ethics, vegetarianism is encouraged
Aang|aang|Furthermore, the writers gave Aang a consistent reluctance to fight and an aversion to killing
Aang|aang|"In ""The Spirit World (Winter Solstice, Part 1)"", Aang encounters an angry spirit destroying a village and kidnapping villagers; but instead of fighting the spirit, Aang negotiates"
Aang|aang|He is also depicted showing ethical reluctance in killing the Phoenix King, and eventually strips Ozai of his bending instead of murdering him.
Aang|aang|As the Avatar, Aang is capable of bending all four elements (air, water, earth and fire)
Aang|aang|"The series' creators consulted a professional martial artist in the design of the show's fighting style; each of these styles' philosophies and set movements corresponds to a specific ""bending arts"".The creators made bending a natural extension of consistent limitations and rules of the world"
Aang|aang|Everything in Avatar's world, whether it be clothing, culture or infrastructure, is influenced by bending
Aang|aang|The City of Omashu uses a complex system of gravity and earthbending to transport supplies
Aang|aang|The Water Tribes were a naval superpower
Aang|aang|their buildings are made of ice and used waterbending as mechanisms for their walls and gates
Aang|aang|Airbenders built temples atop high mountains and cliffs that could only be easily reached by Airbending and they have a hermetic ideology to reflect this isolation
Aang|aang|The Fire Nation were the first to industrialize due to their ability to generate power and master metallurgy with their bending of fire and lightning.
Aang|aang|At the start of the series, Aang is initially only proficient in air, having been able to bend it with ease since he was a young child
Aang|aang|Through the teaching of Katara and Zuko, he gradually learns waterbending and firebending; but struggles with Toph's teachings of earthbending due to its rigid nature conflicting with his desire for freedom
Aang|aang|Aang utilizes all elements equally, but heavily favors airbending for crowd control and non-lethal purposes, in accordance with his pacifism principles.
Aang|aang|Airbending
Aang|aang|"The bending art Aang primarily uses in the entire franchise, is a Southern Temple Style based on an ""internal"" Chinese martial art called Baguazhang"
Aang|aang|Aang is the only person in living memory to have mastered this form of airbending, and would later pass down this knowledge to his son, Tenzin, who with the aid of Korra, would prove instrumental in the reconstruction and preservation of Air Nomad oral and intangible cultural heritage
Aang|aang|"Due to the genocide of his people, all other ""styles of airbending arts"" have been forever lost to history"
Aang|aang|This fighting style focuses on circular movements, and does not have many finishing moves; traits meant to represent the unpredictability of air and the peaceful character of Airbenders
Aang|aang|"Airbending represents the element of freedom, and is categorized as the most elusive of the ""four bending arts"""
Aang|aang|Airbending utilizes negative jing, which involves retreating and dodging attacks
Aang|aang|"Airbending involves ""smooth coiling and uncoiling actions""; dynamic footwork, throws, and open-handed techniques; and swift, evasive maneuvers designed to evoke the ""intangibility and explosive power of wind"""
Aang|aang|These techniques are intended to increase the difficulty for opponents to attack directly or land a lethal blow—allowing airbenders to defend themselves while also protecting their attacker from injury—a pacifist-philosophy that is prevalent among the Air Nomad people
Aang|aang|"Airbending lacks ""finishing moves"" or effective methods for permanently disabling foes, a weakness frequently exploited by opponents."
Aang|aang|Waterbending
Aang|aang|"Waterbending is the bending art Katara, later Pakku, teaches Aang in the series, which is based on Chinese martial arts techniques of ""internal style"" T'ai chi ch'uan and Jeet Kune Do"
Aang|aang|When Aang traveled north, he learned Northern Tribe Yin-style
Aang|aang|"During the Legend of Korra, Katara is the only Master of ""Southern Tribe Yang-style"", forced to reconstruct the style from surviving manuscripts; all other masters were killed, their collective knowledge confiscated or destroyed by the Fire Nation"
Aang|aang|"Waterbending represents the element of change—a shapeshifter constantly changing forms—and is categorized as the most adaptive or pliable of the ""four bending arts"""
Aang|aang|"Waterbending emphasizes ""softness and breathing"" over ""hard aggression""; fluid and graceful, acting in concert with the environment; creating opportunities where none exist; this ""flow of energy"" allows their defensive maneuvers to translate into focus on control and counter-offenses, turning their opponents' momentum against them"
Aang|aang|Despite these advantages, Waterbending is almost entirely dependent on inertia; it is essential for practitioners to not be rigid, but to be fluid and able to adapt to any situation.
Aang|aang|Earthbending
Aang|aang|Earthbending is the martial art Toph teaches Aang in the series, which is based on Chinese martial arts techniques of Hóng Quán and Chu Gar Nán Pài Tángláng
Aang|aang|Earthbending represents the element of substance
Aang|aang|Toph's earthbending style is Chu Gar Praying Mantis, as opposed to the more common Hung Gar, taught to her by the original earthbenders, badgermoles
Aang|aang|"Earthbending is categorized as the most diverse and enduring of the ""four bending arts"""
Aang|aang|Earthbending is the geokinetic ability to manipulate earth, rock, sand, lava, and metals in all their various forms
Aang|aang|Earthbending utilizes neutral jing, which involves waiting and listening for the right moment to act decisively
Aang|aang|"Earthbending involves enduring attacks until the right opportunity to counterattack reveals itself, emphasizes ""heavily rooted stances and strong blows that evoke the mass and power of earth"", and demands precise stepping footwork to maintain constant contact with the ground"
Aang|aang|Earthbending parallels Five Animals movements (such as the tiger's hard blows and the crane's affinity to landing gracefully)
Aang|aang|Earthbending is at its strongest when the feet or hand are in direct contact with the ground, enabling earthbenders to transfer their kinetic energies into their bending for fast and powerful moves
Aang|aang|This reliance on direct contact with the earth is a literal Achilles' heel; separating earthbenders from any contact with the earth renders them ineffective.
Aang|aang|Firebending
Aang|aang|Firebending is the martial art Zuko teaches Aang in the series, which is based on chinese martial arts techniques of Changquan, Shaolinquan, Lóng Xíng Mó Qiáo and Xing Yi Quan
Aang|aang|Firebending represents the element of power—desire and will paired with energy to achieve it, a philosophy reflected in firebending's unique capability for its users to generate their central element, rather than manipulating already present sources
Aang|aang|Firebenders use breath control to manipulate chi in their own bodies and convert the energy from breathing into fire once it exits the body
Aang|aang|"A century of warfare have corrupted the Fire Nation's rich culture, and with it, their firebending-styles ""regressed"" into militarized format based on hatred and raw aggression; Zuko and Aang sought to learn firebending in its purest and most harmonious form, and rediscovered Dancing Dragon Style from the last surviving dragons"
Aang|aang|Dragon Style is the bending art first practiced by the Sun Warriors, the earliest incarnation of the modern Fire Nation; for the Sun Warriors, fire is life, energy, and creativity, rather than destruction and hate
Aang|aang|"Firebending is categorized as the most determined and powerful of the ""four bending arts"""
Aang|aang|All Firebending styles emphasize initiative and speed, overwhelming their opponents with powerful jabs and kicks that hurl fire before building to an explosive finishing move, mirroring the vitality and explosive power of fire
Aang|aang|"This is often seen in the ""Agni Kai"" or fire-duels that Zuko competes in"
Aang|aang|A master firebender will confidently control fire, rather than allowing their energy to become unfocused rage
Aang|aang|A select few high-level firebenders can access highly destructive and lethal skills, such as lightning-bending and combustion-bending
Aang|aang|Firebending's offensive power comes with a trade-off
Aang|aang|a lack of blocks or evasive maneuvers, particularly when facing other elements.
Aang|aang|Energybending
Aang|aang|Aang learned about energybending from the last living lion turtle, as he did not wish to kill Ozai, and was given the ability to do so
Aang|aang|He is able to use energybending to connect with his inner spirit and gain cosmic energy from the universe
Aang|aang|In The Legend of Korra, Aang gave Avatar Korra, the current Avatar, the ability to energybend, which was used to restore people's bending abilities after Amon removed them using bloodbending.
Aang|aang|"As the Avatar, Aang is as a bridge between ""Material World"" and the ""Spirit World"", the plane of existence where the universe's disembodied spirits dwell"
Aang|aang|His spirituality training progressed swiftly, granting visions and access to the various memories from his past lives.
Aang|aang|As his predecessors, his most powerful ability is the Avatar State, in which he receives a massive boost in raw power from the cosmic energy, enabling him to easily overcome any opponent that tries to fight him head on
Aang|aang|In addition, this state allows him to access bending techniques he would not have learned during his own lifetime but throughout those of his past lives
Aang|aang|If he is killed in the Avatar State, then this would cause the Avatar to cease being reincarnated and end the Avatar Cycle.
Aang|aang|Aang was received exceptionally by critics and fans
Aang|aang|"Kendall Lyons stated, ""Aang seems to be the lighthearted kid that you can easily familiarize yourself with"", and that he ""seems to bring comfort in the most dangerous or hostile situations."" There are many similar descriptions about Aang as a childlike character who is ""reckless and excitable"""
Aang|aang|"Reviews point out that ""as the Avatar, Aang seems unstoppable, but as Aang, he is just another Airbender""; the review states later that the show continues to focus on a more realistic character instead of a perfect one by revealing many character flaws.In 2016, Screen Rant ranked Aang #15 on its ""30 Best Animated TV Characters Of All Time"" list.At the 2020 Tokyo Summer Olympics, Dutch windsurfer Kiran Badloe won the gold medal in Men's RS"

Katara (Avatar: The Last Airbender)|katara|She is also seen bending soup (which allows her to cook meals), and bends perfume while battling a smell-dependent monster
Katara (Avatar: The Last Airbender)|katara|"In the episode ""The Painted Lady,"" she uses her bending to create a thick fog"
Katara (Avatar: The Last Airbender)|katara|Katara also demonstrates the ability to bend sweat and the ability to manipulate mud with Toph, who manipulates the dirt while Katara controls the water.
Katara (Avatar: The Last Airbender)|katara|Katara is one of the few waterbenders born with the sub-ability of healing injuries or wounds, first demonstrated after she is burned by Aang's first attempt at firebending
Katara (Avatar: The Last Airbender)|katara|She strengthens this ability under the tutelage of the Northern Water Tribe's healer Yagoda
Katara (Avatar: The Last Airbender)|katara|She uses it thereafter to relieve sickness; overcome brainwashing; and heal wounds such as burns and bleeding injuries
Katara (Avatar: The Last Airbender)|katara|Nevertheless, she cannot cure all sicknesses, mend brain damage, or heal internal injuries and birth defects
Katara (Avatar: The Last Airbender)|katara|Using special water she obtained from the Northern Water Tribe's Spirit Shrine, she was able to heal a fatal wound Azula inflicted upon Aang, thus reviving him from death
Katara (Avatar: The Last Airbender)|katara|She speculated that she would be able to use that same water to heal the scar on Zuko's face, but was interrupted before she could do so
Katara (Avatar: The Last Airbender)|katara|By the time of The Legend of Korra, Lin Beifong (Toph's metalbender daughter) claims that she is the best healer in the world.
Katara (Avatar: The Last Airbender)|katara|"Katara has another waterbending technique known as ""bloodbending"""
Katara (Avatar: The Last Airbender)|katara|She first used this technique in the eighth episode of Book Three
Katara (Avatar: The Last Airbender)|katara|This ability consists in manipulating the water inside a creature's body, leaving the target unable to move or resist in any way
Katara (Avatar: The Last Airbender)|katara|Once she has taken control, she can make it move in any manner she desires
Katara (Avatar: The Last Airbender)|katara|She is only able to bloodbend during a full moon, when her waterbending power is at its peak
Katara (Avatar: The Last Airbender)|katara|Katara was forced to learn bloodbending by Hama, an elderly Water Tribe woman who originally developed the technique and who wanted Katara to learn it for it to be passed on to others
Katara (Avatar: The Last Airbender)|katara|However, Katara abhors this technique and has only used it twice in times of great stress
Katara (Avatar: The Last Airbender)|katara|In later years, she worked to make the practice a criminal offense.

Azula|azula|In the show, Azula is the crown princess of the Fire Nation and an extremely powerful firebending prodigy
Azula|azula|Upon Fire Lord Ozai's orders, she begins a quest with her childhood friends Mai and Ty Lee to retrieve her banished brother Prince Zuko and his mentor, their uncle Iroh, while also attempting to capture Avatar Aang, considered the Fire Nation's greatest threat to victory in the war
Azula|azula|Azula is known for being a skilled strategist and manipulator

Azula|azula|Book One
Azula|azula|Water
Azula|azula|Since she is the shadowed firebender in the series' opening sequence, Azula appears at the beginning of every episode of Avatar
Azula|azula|The Last Airbender
Azula|azula|In the first season, she makes her first appearance in a flashback during 13-year-old Zuko's Agni Kai (firebending duel) against their father, Fire Lord Ozai
Azula|azula|Azula smirks as Zuko's face is burned after he refuses to fight Ozai, who takes this as a sign of weakness and disrespect
Azula|azula|The Fire Lord then banishes the permanently scarred Zuko and tasks him with finding the long-lost avatar
Azula|azula|Azula makes a second brief appearance at the end of the first season when Ozai tasks her with repatriating Zuko and Iroh, who accompanied his nephew into exile and briefly cooperated with the series' protagonists.
Azula|azula|Book Two
Azula|azula|Earth
Azula|azula|In the second season, Azula is fully introduced as the main antagonist, who encounters the Avatar in Omashu, and later attempts to capture him by enlisting her childhood friends Mai and Ty Lee
Azula|azula|Azula continues to pursue Aang, Zuko, and Iroh for the rest of the season
Azula|azula|After her initial failure to enter the Earth Kingdom capital Ba Sing Se using a giant drill to breach the city's strong outer wall, Azula comes in contact with the Kyoshi Warriors, fighters who, despite their lack of ability to bend any element, dress as and utilize the fighting style of Kyoshi, a past Avatar
Azula|azula|Azula along with Mai and Ty Lee proceeds to defeat and impersonate them.Posing as Kyoshi Warriors, Azula and her friends infiltrate Ba Sing Se and befriend Earth King Kuei, who tells them about the planned invasion of the Fire Nation during an upcoming solar eclipse
Azula|azula|Azula also comes to understand that the secret police and intelligence agency known as the Dai Li is the key to power in the capital
Azula|azula|She is discovered as an infiltrator by Dai Li agents and brought before their imprisoned leader, Long Feng
Azula|azula|Having in fact intentionally exposed herself, Azula lulls him into a false sense of control and accepts his offer to help stage a coup d'état against the Earth King and the loyalist Council of Five
Azula|azula|Immediately after her seizure of power, Azula betrays Long Feng and assumes permanent leadership of the Dai Li
Azula|azula|She also encounters Zuko in the city and convinces him to join her in order to redeem himself
Azula|azula|During their showdown, Azula strikes Aang with a bolt of lightning while he is in the Avatar State, though he is later revived by Katara
Azula|azula|Azula then orders the Dai Li to tear down the walls of Ba Sing Se, exposing the city to an invasion and occupation by the Fire Nation.
Azula|azula|Book Three
Azula|azula|Fire
Azula|azula|In the early episodes of this season, Azula bonds with her brother and friends after their victorious return to the Fire Nation with Iroh as a prisoner
Azula|azula|However, Azula lies to Ozai by claiming that Zuko killed Aang, as she has a hunch that Aang survived and knows that all the blame would now fall on Zuko if this were true
Azula|azula|"During the two-part episode ""The Day of Black Sun,"" Aang assembles an elite invasion force and attacks the capital, taking advantage of a solar eclipse that renders the firebenders powerless"
Azula|azula|Having been warned by Azula, Ozai is evacuated to an underground bunker prior to the invasion
Azula|azula|Azula and her Dai Li agents stall Aang and his friends Sokka and Toph from finding Ozai before the eclipse, which lasts only eight minutes, allowing the firebenders to retaliate with full force once they regain their bending, causing the invasion to fail
Azula|azula|However, Zuko defects to Team Avatar after confronting Ozai during the eclipse.Later, Azula, accompanied by Mai and Ty Lee, visits The Boiling Rock, the top security Fire Nation prison where Zuko has been captured in an attempt to infiltrate the prison and rescue the captured forces of the failed invasion
Azula|azula|However, Zuko, Sokka, Suki (leader of the Kyoshi Warriors, who had been captured in the aftermath of their battle with Azula) and Sokka's father Hakoda manages to escape
Azula|azula|Mai betrays Azula by aiding the group's escape, proclaiming that she is doing so out of her love for Zuko
Azula|azula|Enraged, Azula attempts to attack Mai but is stopped by Ty Lee, who renders her incapable of bending by blocking her chi (the energy within one which one would use for bending)
Azula|azula|After having Mai and Ty Lee imprisoned for betraying her, Azula leads a platoon to the Western Air Temple, where she duels with Zuko
Azula|azula|The fight ends in a draw, with Azula narrowly escaping death after falling from one of the airships while the protagonists manage to flee.In the finale, Ozai leaves Azula behind in the Fire Nation as he sets out to conquer the world, naming her as his successor to the Fire Lord position
Azula|azula|Soon afterward, Azula sinks into psychosis, hallucinates about her long-lost mother, and deposes nearly all of her servants and advisers
Azula|azula|Before she is crowned as Fire Lord, Zuko and Katara interrupt the ceremony, whereupon Azula challenges Zuko to single combat in an Agni Kai
Azula|azula|However, Azula's attacks, while powerful, are wild and emotional while Zuko's are calm and disciplined; and when his attacks begin to overpower her, she sends a bolt of lightning toward Katara, but ends up striking down Zuko, who attempts to redirect it
Azula|azula|She is ultimately defeated by Katara who takes her captive via waterbending, causing Azula to have a complete nervous breakdown
Azula|azula|Her fate is currently unknown.
Azula|azula|Avatar
Azula|azula|The Last Airbender comic series
Azula|azula|Following the end of the war, Azula is admitted to a psychiatric institution, where she is closely monitored
Azula|azula|One year after the war's end, Zuko visits Azula to request her assistance in gaining information from Ozai on the whereabouts of their long-lost mother Ursa, and Azula accepts without asking for anything in return.
Azula|azula|When Azula visits Ozai in his prison, they are watched by Fire Lord Zuko before she asks him to leave when their father remains silent in her presence
Azula|azula|Azula, having learned of the letters Ursa sent which falsely claims that Fire Lord Zuko is not Ozai's biological son, dodges her brother's questions while distracting him with her bending long enough to access the letters and burn them
Azula|azula|She uses this as leverage as she convinces Zuko to allow her to join his quest to find Ursa in return for the letters' information, though she intends to use the letters' content to dethrone her brother while also murdering their mother
Azula|azula|Her request is granted, and she becomes a protagonist by joining Team Avatar
Azula|azula|The team eventually finds that Ursa lost her memory and assumed the identity of Noriko, starting a new family in her home village
Azula|azula|Although Azula nearly kills Ursa, she becomes emotionally confused after her mother apologizes for not showing her enough motherly love and even more after Fire Lord Zuko reveals that he still loves his sister, despite their strained relationship
Azula|azula|This results in a confused Azula running off into the wilderness
Azula|azula|For several weeks, Zuko searches for Azula but fails to find her.
Azula|azula|After several weeks, Azula helps her followers from the mental institution she was held in escape
Azula|azula|They resurface under the guise of kemurikage (dark spirits)
Azula|azula|"The ""kemurikage"" kidnap many children"
Azula|azula|After Zuko frees the children, Azula tells him that her motivation is to make him more like their father by relying on fear to maintain control
Azula|azula|Azula then escapes and is last seen observing Zuko apologizing to his people for his recent actions
Azula|azula|As Azula directly tells Zuko about her supposed intentions and seems to take his speech seriously, she is possibly acting as a stealth mentor by using reverse psychology on Zuko
Azula|azula|Azula's current fate is unknown, as she has yet to appear in any later storylines.
Azula|azula|Princess Azula appears as an antagonist in the video games Avatar
Azula|azula|The Last Airbender – The Burning Earth and Avatar
Azula|azula|The Last Airbender – Into the Inferno again voiced by Grey DeLisle.
Azula|azula|"Konietzko notes that Azula's design when compared to other main characters ""came together relatively quickly."" Azula was originally going to wear a heavily phoenix-themed armor, though the idea was eventually abandoned"
Azula|azula|Azula's blue firebending was meant to symbolize that she was more powerful than Zuko as well as a firebending prodigy, and also to easily distinguish her attacks from his in their fights
Azula|azula|She was initially intended to have an arranged marriage during the third season
Azula|azula|"Both creators hold the character in high regard; Konietzko believes she is ""by far the most complex, interesting, and dangerous villain in the series"" while DiMartino wrote that she was his favorite villain in the series."
Azula|azula|Azula is voiced by Grey DeLisle
Azula|azula|"DeLisle recounts that she had studied her ""whole life"" for well-written characters like Azula who were hard to come by"
Azula|azula|Overall, DeLisle felt her life had changed positively from the role, and association with the series, relaying this to Janet Varney who would voice Korra in the sequel series.
Azula|azula|Although Azula's age is never stated in the series itself, the Avatar website, as well as the book The Earth Kingdom Chronicles, gives her age as fourteen
Azula|azula|She is Fire Lord Sozin's great-granddaughter through Ozai, and Avatar Roku's through her mother, Ursa
Azula|azula|In another flashback, it is revealed that she is named after her paternal grandfather Azulon, Ozai's father
Azula|azula|Even as a child, Azula demonstrated her natural talents early in life, along with her tendency for malice and perfectionism
Azula|azula|Her sharp wit and the skill she displayed towards Firebending gained her much attention and acclaim, often at Zuko's expense
Azula|azula|"Even when young, Azula suggests that her father would make a better Fire Lord than the heir apparent, her uncle Iroh, whom she dubbed ""a quitter and a loser"" for abandoning his siege of the Earth Kingdom's capital Ba Sing Se, which would have secured the Fire Nation's victory in the war, after the death of his son Lu Ten."
Azula|azula|Azula is a firebending prodigy and a dedicated perfectionist
Azula|azula|As one who wants nothing less than absolute control, she likewise has remarkable control of herself, seemingly able to react to any situation at a moment's notice without losing her composure
Azula|azula|This is shown when she learns of a secret plot to invade the Fire Nation while in disguise but does not react to not blow her cover
Azula|azula|Though it's not canonically confirmed, experts speculate that Azula's extremely strong locus of control and her subsequent loss of control was predictive of her later descent into a bout of psychosis.Psychological analyses estimate Azula as being highly intelligent, and as suffering from narcissistic and antisocial personality disorders with notable Machiavellian and, at times, sadistic traits
Azula|azula|Following the betrayal by her closest friends Mai and Ty Lee, she possibly develops schizoaffective disorder, as indicated by her delusions of persecution, hallucinations of her mother speaking to her, as well as her frequent and radical intermittent mood fluctuations
Azula|azula|The drastic combination of antisocial, narcissistic and Machiavellian traits suggests that Azula appears to suffer from a dark triad personality.
Azula|azula|From a young age, Azula had a cruel, sociopathic personality, showing almost no empathy or remorse for actions that harmed others both physically and emotionally
Azula|azula|Azula was heavily influenced by her father, who favored her over Zuko due to her superior firebending abilities
Azula|azula|However, Azula's father was a ruthless man incapable of true love
Azula|azula|Azula was also constantly scolded by her mother due to her cruel nature
Azula|azula|This shaped Azula's fears that she could not count on love from anyone, no matter how close they seemed
Azula|azula|Unable to trust others, she instead began to control them using fear.
Azula|azula|"Although a skilled strategist and capable of predicting her enemies' moves, she is awkward in social situations, and later admits to jealousy of Ty Lee's ability to attract potential sweethearts during ""The Beach"" episode"
Azula|azula|She ends up seducing Chan with Ty Lee's advice to act dumb; however, she scares him away when she shows her true personality.
Azula|azula|From childhood, Azula believed her mother favored Zuko and thought her monstrous, which she admitted to be true but hurt her deeply
Azula|azula|After she was betrayed by Mai and Ty Lee, her mental state gradually collapsed, as her attacks became far more vicious and she was seemingly obsessed with killing Zuko
Azula|azula|After her defeat, it is revealed in the graphic novel The Promise that she was admitted into a mental institution in the Fire Nation due to her deranged mental state, possibly suffering from schizophrenia
Azula|azula|Both in the series and the comics, she is shown to be disturbed by frequent hallucinations of her mother.
Azula|azula|Azula often acts cold-hearted towards her uncle and her brother, but she appears to show some genuine concern for Zuko in the season 2 finale and early episodes of season 3
Azula|azula|Although she seems to care about her friends, she frequently manipulates them, as seen when she threatens Ty Lee into leaving the circus in Book 2
Azula|azula|There has been only one known occurrence of Azula showing remorse by apologizing after unintentionally insulting Ty Lee.
Azula|azula|Azula is highly skilled in firebending, which utilizes Chinese martial arts techniques of Changquan, Shaolinquan, Lóng Xíng Mó Qiáo and Xing Yi Quan
Azula|azula|The series' creators consulted a professional martial artist in the design of the show's fighting style
Azula|azula|Azula is one of the most skilled firebenders in the show and is a very difficult person to defeat in single combat
Azula|azula|Her excellent firebending abilities, hand-to-hand combat skills, intelligence, agility and charisma make her a formidable opponent.
Azula|azula|Azula is the only firebender who can produce blue flames, which are hotter and contain more energy (according to Planck's law) than those of other firebenders who bend normal orange flames
Azula|azula|Her name is derived from azul, the Spanish, Galician and Portuguese word for blue
Azula|azula|However, Azula could not produce blue fire as a young child, as shown in flashbacks
Azula|azula|Similarly, her grandfather Azulon was never shown to wield blue flames despite his namesake implying otherwise
Azula|azula|Azula can also use her firebending in previously unseen ways, such as jets of flames and whirling disks
Azula|azula|She often firebends using only two fingers, rather than a closed fist or open hand common to other firebenders
Azula|azula|Azula can fight for long periods of time without tiring
Azula|azula|She is also able to generate powerful shields of swirling flames, which she uses to withstand the simultaneous combined attacks of Aang, Katara, Zuko and Toph
Azula|azula|She is even able to charge up her fire before releasing it, as was seen during one fight with Aang.Azula is able to propel herself, using her flames, in a manner similar to a rocket
Azula|azula|This ability has also been extended as a means to fly for short periods of time as seen in the Boiling Rock
Azula|azula|She can also breathe fire, as shown when she is defeated by Katara and Zuko.
Azula|azula|"""Lightning is a pure expression of firebending without aggression"
Azula|azula|It is not fueled by rage or emotion the way other firebending is
Azula|azula|Some call lightning the cold-blooded fire
Azula|azula|It is precise and deadly like Azula
Azula|azula|"To perform the technique requires peace of mind."""
Azula|azula|Azula is a skilled unarmed fighter
Azula|azula|"In ""The Avatar State,"" she bests Zuko in combat without resorting to firebending, and in ""The Day of Black Sun,"" she avoids the combined forces of Aang, Toph, and Sokka for several minutes without her bending to aid her"
Azula|azula|"In ""Appa's Lost Days,"" when Suki makes a stab attack at Azula with her fan, Azula jumps horizontally and knocks Suki's sword out of her hand and onto a tree.Azula is an expert in persuasion"
Azula|azula|She is capable of using psychological warfare, intimidation, and mistruths to con other people into obeying her
Azula|azula|"She also has the ability to lie easily without causing any change in her breathing and heart rate (an indication of her psychopathy), making it nearly impossible to detect if she's lying, which she demonstrates in ""The Day of Black Sun."" She is also an accomplished strategist, as she is able to conquer Ba Sing Se, a city thought to be impenetrable while usurping the Earth King and hierarchy of the Earth Kingdom capital all in one swift move."
Azula|azula|Critical response to Azula's character has generally been positive
Azula|azula|Paste Magazine ranked Azula as the ninth best character from the Avatar universe
Azula|azula|"Hollywood.com also included Azula among the ""9 Villains You Should Root For"", commenting that Azula ""proved to be as cunning and vicious a villain as ever appeared on children’s television."" She was also the only female animated character to be featured in the list"
Azula|azula|"ComicsAlliance ranked Azula second in the website's ""Top 10 Cartoon Bad Guys"" list"
Azula|azula|"Ranking the character third for ""The Seven Best Animated Female Villains"", The Mary Sue wrote, ""Gleefully evil and efficient right up until the end"
Azula|azula|"You’re a thorny, flaming rose, Azula, and you were fascinating to watch."" Moviepilot ranked Azula first in the ""Grey Griffin's 6 Greatest Villain Roles"" with writer Mara Mullikin describing her ""a perfectionist"", while also complimenting her ""tactful mind, agility, ruthlessness, manipulative nature and fire bending prowess cemented her as probably being the series' best antagonist."" The same website ranked her the fifth greatest female villain, writing that Azula is ""a fantastic strategist, an excellent manipulator, and perhaps the greatest firebender the world had ever seen."" Website Comicbookmovie ranked her the second best animated villains"
Azula|azula|The character was ranked 11th on Screen Rant's list of hottest superheroes and villains characters.
